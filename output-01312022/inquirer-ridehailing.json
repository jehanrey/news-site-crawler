The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Saturday assailed Arcade City for its continued defiance of the cease-and-desist order against it, as the agency pointed out that the app is encouraging the establishment of illegal transport network companies (TNCs), as well as the activation of unregistered transport network vehicle service (TNVS) providers.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that Arcade City’s business model promotes illegality by espousing that TNCs no longer have to be accredited to be able to operate in the country. Arcade City also claimed that its drivers need not apply for a franchise from the government for them to ferry passengers.  Lizada said this is why when Arcade City app goes online on Monday, enforcers from the LTFRB, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, Land Transportation Office and the Philippine National Police’s Highway Patrol Group will be implementing the power the law against the unregistered ride-hailing app. Lizada warned that members of the law enforcers will be operating undercover as they themselves would avail Arcade City’s services to apprehend drivers and impound their vehicles.  “We cannot afford any more irregularities such as this. We need to protect the riding public,” Lizada told the Inquirer. After Arcade City was ordered this week to cease operations for the second time, it taunted the LTFRB by saying that the board does not understand how its technology and model work. “Arcade City does not provide ‘pre-arranged transportation services for compensation’ and therefore does not fit the LTFRB definition of a transportation network company. Driver entrepreneurs may freely identify as Arcade City drivers, but Arcade City does not require payment from riders or drivers,” it said in a statement. Based on its website, the app would incentivize the growth of its driver and rider network through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency called “arcade tokens.” These tokens could either be sold or used within Arcade’s ecosystem for services and bonus features. Lizada said that on top of apprehending Arcade drivers for “colorum” operations, the LTFRB will also coordinate with the Department of Information and Communications Technology and the US Embassy to “protest” the actions of the company’s founder and CEO, Christopher David.  “He is making a mockery of our rules and regulations,” Lizada said of David, who packages his company as a supposed alternative to Uber. Uber ceased operating as a TNC by Monday, running counter to the Philippine Competition Commission’s (PCC) order for it to remain in operations while a review on the deal of its acquisition by Grab is being conducted.

The measure would prevent “surge pricing” if increased rates are higher than the maximum fare set by the city. Honolulu attorneys will review the measure before it goes to Mayor Kirk Caldwell, who would have 10 days to sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature or veto it.  Uber sent emails to customers across the island of Oahu, which is where the rule would apply, urging them to oppose the rules that would impose “outdated taxi-style requirements on rideshare.” Oahu taxi drivers have been at odds with those who drive for mobile apps that connect riders with nearby drivers. Taxi companies complain that companies such as Uber and Lyft create an unfair playing field because they face fewer restrictions.  Uber has been told the city hasn’t received any consumer complaints about surge pricing, said Tabatha Chow, the company’s senior operations manager for Hawaii. Honolulu has the highest taxi prices in the nation and Uber is 40 percent cheaper, she told council members Wednesday. Surge pricing only happens during peak times such as rush hour, weekend nights and big events, she said, adding that fares go back down when more drivers are on the road.  If Uber and Lyft rides are cheaper, then why do they need to use surge pricing, asked Robert Deluze, owner of Robert’s Taxis, who said ride-hailing companies have hurt the taxi business. Councilwoman Kymberly Marcos Pine, who voted for the limits, said she was concerned to hear that U.S. Navy sailors getting off ships in Pearl Harbor recently were charged as much as $221 to get to Waikiki when a cab ride was $44. As the wife of a sailor, she said she wants to protect service members from being “price gouged.” Uber said in a fact sheet that surge pricing gives drivers the incentive to work in busier areas, which lowers wait times for riders and ensures reliability. Riders and drivers who submitted testimony opposing the measure said taxis aren’t as reliable or affordable as ride-hailing companies. Uber driver Lisa Gonzales wrote that she drives to help support her family of six. During surge pricing, passengers have the option to accept or reject costs, she said, and that it’s based on supply and demand.  Uber and Lyft officials testified in City Council committees last month that the cap on surge pricing would be the first such restriction on the companies in the country, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. “When demand for rides is greater than the number of drivers on the road, passengers may pay an extra percentage on top of the base ride amount,” Lyft said in a statement explaining its “Prime Time” pricing. A $6 ride would become a $9 ride during Prime Time pricing of 50 percent, the statement said, adding that it “only adds a percentage to the ride subtotal, which is calculated before any other fees or additional amounts.” Council Chairman Ernie Martin said he wrote the measure to ensure consumers won’t pay an “unreasonable price.” He said companies will still be able to employ surge pricing — or as he prefers to call it, “predatory pricing” — within limits. The measure would set precedence nationwide, he said: “Other cities are struggling with this as well.” The city’s Department of Customer Services would be tasked with setting the maximum price. Deputy Director Randy Leong told council members that the department opposes setting the threshold but will do so if it becomes law. It’s difficult to dictate to businesses what they may charge, he said. Uber released a statement after the vote saying that, if implemented, the bill will limit consumer choice and put the availability of Uber service on Oahu at risk. /jpv"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1186718/hatchbacks-back-on-ride-hailing-app","title":"Hatchbacks back on ride-hailing app","date":"05:08 AM November 07, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing giant Grab has launched a limited but cheaper type of ride option for budget-conscious passengers.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing giant Grab has launched a limited but cheaper type of ride option for budget-conscious passengers. The service, which was launched last week, also welcomed back to the Grab platform thousands of hatchback drivers who were removed en masse by the transport network company in June at the behest of transport regulators.  GrabCar Hatchback allows passengers to book the compact vehicles whose trunks occupy the same area as the passenger seat. A maximum of three passengers can ride at the same time. The hatchback service would be slightly cheaper than the GrabCar option. According to the approved fare matrix of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), the base fare for hatchbacks would be P30 (P10 less than GrabCar).  Selected areas only Their routes, however, would currently be limited to the central business districts of Makati, Taguig and Pasig.  The LTFRB earlier maintained that hatchbacks were not safe for public transport, prompting displaced drivers to file a complaint before the Anti-Red Tape Authority over the board’s “irregular” application process for transport network vehicle services (TNVS).

There was no official count of participants in the mass action although leaders of the TNVS community gave estimates ranging from 10,000 to 30,000. But since some of those who took part were drivers who were deactivated last month, the strike did not paralyze ride-hailing services.  Ninoy Mopas, president of TNVS group Thug Philippines, sought to differentiate the holiday from a conventional strike, saying a sizeable number of drivers had continued operating. “We gave our members and groups the choice to stay online to provide service to the riding public. The ones who are here are probably the ones who were deactivated, operate at night and those who were dismissed,” Mopas said during a dialogue between various agencies.  “This transport holiday did not burden the commuters. If you found it hard to book, honestly, it is harder to book on Mondays because there are only a few drivers,” he added. Grab, the largest employer of TNVS drivers, also said the strike had no discernible impact on its operations. At8 a.m., two hours after TNVS drivers had said they would go offline, Grab’s platform was “pretty normal,” according to communications manager Fiona Nicolas.  Different TNVS groups will conduct a much-awaited dialogue with the LTFRB regarding their concerns today. These include charges that the agency was constantly adding new requirements and changing the process for acquiring the provisional authority that TNVS drivers needed to go online."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1186202/dont-kill-off-local-ride-hailing-firms-group-asks-govt","title":"Don’t kill off local ride-hailing firms, group asks gov’t","date":"03:59 AM November 06, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Following a report that China’s biggest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, was in talks to break Grab’s monopoly in the Philippines, a commuter advocacy group has urged the government to support local ride-hailing apps instead of opening the market to more foreign-owned platforms.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Following a report that China’s biggest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, was in talks to break Grab’s monopoly in the Philippines, a commuter advocacy group has urged the government to support local ride-hailing apps instead of opening the market to more foreign-owned platforms.

The nine local TNCs are Owto, GoLag, Ryde, uHop, Hype, Hirna, SnappyCab, e-Pick Me Up and Micab. “Homegrown TNCs should be supported rather than killed by allowing giant foreign-owned app-based ride-hailing firms to come in,” Morillo said.

After Uber’s exit, Vietnamese apps TaxiGo, Vivu, T.net, Xelo and Vato were set up to compete with Grab. But they have failed to attract as many passengers, mostly due to lack of advertising and promotions.  After Uber left, Grab’s rates increased, especially during peak hours, holidays or during bad weather, according to many passengers in HCM City. Tran Thi Kim Hong, 50, of HCM City’s District 4, who uses Grab to go to work every day, said: “They no longer offer discounts as much as before, with prices rising 10-20 per cent, and even 50-80 per cent during peak hours.”  The peak period now is one hour longer compared to the past period. “The rates also went up during non-peak hours, especially in areas where there are fewer cars,” she said. Grab drivers have complained about high commission rates, nearly 20 per cent for veteran drivers, and more than 28 per cent for new drivers.  Some drivers said they were working more hours but earning less money, while others who took out loans to buy a car said they were driving 10-12 hours a day so they could pay back their loans. Local apps Despite complaints from drivers and some passengers about Grab, the company still retains the most market share. Vietnamese companies have invested less in advertising and have had fewer promotions. In addition, since many of them do not have enough cars and drivers, passengers often have to wait for a long time. In some areas, for example, passengers have complained that it was difficult to get in touch with Vato, which received a US$100 million investment from Phuong Trang Tourism Service and Transport JSC in a bid to compete with Grab.  Although the prices for T.net and Xelo are reasonable, passengers have also complained that it was difficult to reach them by phone. To attract drivers, many Vietnamese businesses have exempted the commission rate for drivers during the initial period, and then later take a low commission rate of no more than 15 per cent. However, due to a limited number of passengers, the local businesses cannot find enough drivers. Drivers for the Vietnamese businesses have also complained about changing policies. As soon as revenue increases, the company’s commission rate usually goes up as well, they say. As of the end of 2017, Grab had attracted US$2 billion worth of investment from partners to serve the Southeast Asian market. In May, Toyota raised $1 billion for Grab. Meanwhile, most Vietnamese ride-hailing app businesses must rely on their own resources, and have not called for investors. Nguyen Xuan Thuy, of the Division of Transport under the Ministry of Transport, said: “What they (Vietnamese passengers) need is good service at a reasonable price.” “The more competitive the market is, the more customers will benefit. It’s important that Vietnamese businesses recognize their shortcomings to improve their services,” he said. Economist Bui Quang Tin said Vietnamese ride-hailing apps should take advantage of Uber’s exit to expand their market share and offer more choices for local commuters. “Those who provide the best service will be the winners,” he said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As of April 8, all Uber rides had shifted to the Grab app, which meant that former Uber drivers had to either join Grab or stop working. In the deal when Grab took over Uber operations in Southeast Asia, Uber was allowed to retain 27.5 per cent of Grab’s shares."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1202646/ltfrb-to-probe-ride-hailing-apps-for-higher-holiday-fares","title":"LTFRB to probe ride-hailing apps for higher holiday fares","date":"04:05 AM December 18, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Tuesday called for a meeting with ride-hailing services operating in Metro Manila amid reports of unreasonable price surges since the start of the holiday season.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Tuesday called for a meeting with ride-hailing services operating in Metro Manila amid reports of unreasonable price surges since the start of the holiday season. In a statement, LTFRB chair Martin Delgra promised to look into allegations of price-gouging this week as he reminded transport network companies (TNCs) to adhere to the approved fare matrix: P40 as base fare, P10-15 per kilometer, P2 per minute travel charge and a surge cap of 2x depending on the flow of traffic.  Although Delgra did not name the specific TNCs, commuters have been complaining lately about the high surge rates charged by Grab, which has a virtually monopoly on the ride-hailing industry in the country. Reached for comment, Grab said it had not yet received the official invite from the LTFRB although it promised to take part in the discussion.  In a Twitter thread, journalist Janvic Mateo posted some of the receipts for his Grab rides during the holiday season and noted that the surcharges for some trips took up nearly half of his total fare. In one trip that cost P777, for example, the surge charge was at P328.00, or 42 percent of the fare.In just two weeks, Mateo paid over P2,000 in surge charges, which were sometimes almost as expensive as the actual fare.  “I wish I don’t have to travel as often as I do. [I] wish we have a better public transport system,” he said. Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian also asked the LTFRB to take another look at the fare matrix of Grab to make sure it was following the rules of surge pricing.Grab had attributed the higher rates to the increased demand for vehicles and the limited number of available drivers. “The high fare is killing the festive mood of many Filipino commuters. We don’t want to let Grab play the Grinch who stole Christmas from Juan de la Cruz because of high fare,” Gatchalian said in a statement. He noted that based on the fare matrix approved in August, transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) units should charge a flag down rate of up to P40 for sedans, up to P50 for premium Asian utility vehicles/sport utility vehicles (AUV/SUV) and up to P30 for hatchbacks/subcompact vehicles. This was on top of a P15 additional charge per kilometer for sedans, P18 for SUVs and P13 for hatchbacks—aside from the P2 charge per minute of travel. TNCs are also allowed to double their per kilometer and per minute charges through surge pricing.  But Gatchalian said Grab should also explain why it was imposing surge pricing even in the wee hours of the morning when there were fewer bookings and less traffic on the road. There should be more competitors for prices to go down, he added although he noted that while there were other TNVS companies, these were small players who could not go head-to-head with the current industry leader. “Without competition in the hail-riding industry, our poor commuters will always be at the mercy of high fares,” Gatchalian said. “This is why we are supporting the entry of other players in this industry, such as the TNVS GoJek, so that commuters would have choices and would not have to endure the high rates of Grab,” he added —With a report from Leila B.

A $6 ride would become a $9 ride during Prime Time pricing of 50 percent, the statement said, adding that it “only adds a percentage to the ride subtotal, which is calculated before any other fees or additional amounts.” Council Chairman Ernie Martin said he wrote the measure to ensure consumers won’t pay an “unreasonable price.” He said companies will still be able to employ surge pricing — or as he prefers to call it, “predatory pricing” — within limits. The measure would set precedence nationwide, he said: “Other cities are struggling with this as well.” The city’s Department of Customer Services would be tasked with setting the maximum price. Deputy Director Randy Leong told council members that the department opposes setting the threshold but will do so if it becomes law. It’s difficult to dictate to businesses what they may charge, he said. Uber released a statement after the vote saying that, if implemented, the bill will limit consumer choice and put the availability of Uber service on Oahu at risk. /jpv"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1186718/hatchbacks-back-on-ride-hailing-app","title":"Hatchbacks back on ride-hailing app","date":"05:08 AM November 07, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing giant Grab has launched a limited but cheaper type of ride option for budget-conscious passengers.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing giant Grab has launched a limited but cheaper type of ride option for budget-conscious passengers.

GrabCar Hatchback allows passengers to book the compact vehicles whose trunks occupy the same area as the passenger seat. A maximum of three passengers can ride at the same time.

There was no official count of participants in the mass action although leaders of the TNVS community gave estimates ranging from 10,000 to 30,000. But since some of those who took part were drivers who were deactivated last month, the strike did not paralyze ride-hailing services.  Ninoy Mopas, president of TNVS group Thug Philippines, sought to differentiate the holiday from a conventional strike, saying a sizeable number of drivers had continued operating. “We gave our members and groups the choice to stay online to provide service to the riding public. The ones who are here are probably the ones who were deactivated, operate at night and those who were dismissed,” Mopas said during a dialogue between various agencies.  “This transport holiday did not burden the commuters. If you found it hard to book, honestly, it is harder to book on Mondays because there are only a few drivers,” he added. Grab, the largest employer of TNVS drivers, also said the strike had no discernible impact on its operations. At8 a.m., two hours after TNVS drivers had said they would go offline, Grab’s platform was “pretty normal,” according to communications manager Fiona Nicolas.  Different TNVS groups will conduct a much-awaited dialogue with the LTFRB regarding their concerns today.

After Uber’s exit, Vietnamese apps TaxiGo, Vivu, T.net, Xelo and Vato were set up to compete with Grab. But they have failed to attract as many passengers, mostly due to lack of advertising and promotions.  After Uber left, Grab’s rates increased, especially during peak hours, holidays or during bad weather, according to many passengers in HCM City. Tran Thi Kim Hong, 50, of HCM City’s District 4, who uses Grab to go to work every day, said: “They no longer offer discounts as much as before, with prices rising 10-20 per cent, and even 50-80 per cent during peak hours.”  The peak period now is one hour longer compared to the past period. “The rates also went up during non-peak hours, especially in areas where there are fewer cars,” she said. Grab drivers have complained about high commission rates, nearly 20 per cent for veteran drivers, and more than 28 per cent for new drivers.  Some drivers said they were working more hours but earning less money, while others who took out loans to buy a car said they were driving 10-12 hours a day so they could pay back their loans. Local apps Despite complaints from drivers and some passengers about Grab, the company still retains the most market share. Vietnamese companies have invested less in advertising and have had fewer promotions. In addition, since many of them do not have enough cars and drivers, passengers often have to wait for a long time. In some areas, for example, passengers have complained that it was difficult to get in touch with Vato, which received a US$100 million investment from Phuong Trang Tourism Service and Transport JSC in a bid to compete with Grab.  Although the prices for T.net and Xelo are reasonable, passengers have also complained that it was difficult to reach them by phone. To attract drivers, many Vietnamese businesses have exempted the commission rate for drivers during the initial period, and then later take a low commission rate of no more than 15 per cent. However, due to a limited number of passengers, the local businesses cannot find enough drivers. Drivers for the Vietnamese businesses have also complained about changing policies. As soon as revenue increases, the company’s commission rate usually goes up as well, they say. As of the end of 2017, Grab had attracted US$2 billion worth of investment from partners to serve the Southeast Asian market. In May, Toyota raised $1 billion for Grab. Meanwhile, most Vietnamese ride-hailing app businesses must rely on their own resources, and have not called for investors. Nguyen Xuan Thuy, of the Division of Transport under the Ministry of Transport, said: “What they (Vietnamese passengers) need is good service at a reasonable price.” “The more competitive the market is, the more customers will benefit. It’s important that Vietnamese businesses recognize their shortcomings to improve their services,” he said. Economist Bui Quang Tin said Vietnamese ride-hailing apps should take advantage of Uber’s exit to expand their market share and offer more choices for local commuters. “Those who provide the best service will be the winners,” he said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As of April 8, all Uber rides had shifted to the Grab app, which meant that former Uber drivers had to either join Grab or stop working.

In a statement, LTFRB chair Martin Delgra promised to look into allegations of price-gouging this week as he reminded transport network companies (TNCs) to adhere to the approved fare matrix: P40 as base fare, P10-15 per kilometer, P2 per minute travel charge and a surge cap of 2x depending on the flow of traffic.  Although Delgra did not name the specific TNCs, commuters have been complaining lately about the high surge rates charged by Grab, which has a virtually monopoly on the ride-hailing industry in the country. Reached for comment, Grab said it had not yet received the official invite from the LTFRB although it promised to take part in the discussion.  In a Twitter thread, journalist Janvic Mateo posted some of the receipts for his Grab rides during the holiday season and noted that the surcharges for some trips took up nearly half of his total fare. In one trip that cost P777, for example, the surge charge was at P328.00, or 42 percent of the fare.In just two weeks, Mateo paid over P2,000 in surge charges, which were sometimes almost as expensive as the actual fare.  “I wish I don’t have to travel as often as I do. [I] wish we have a better public transport system,” he said. Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian also asked the LTFRB to take another look at the fare matrix of Grab to make sure it was following the rules of surge pricing.Grab had attributed the higher rates to the increased demand for vehicles and the limited number of available drivers. “The high fare is killing the festive mood of many Filipino commuters. We don’t want to let Grab play the Grinch who stole Christmas from Juan de la Cruz because of high fare,” Gatchalian said in a statement. He noted that based on the fare matrix approved in August, transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) units should charge a flag down rate of up to P40 for sedans, up to P50 for premium Asian utility vehicles/sport utility vehicles (AUV/SUV) and up to P30 for hatchbacks/subcompact vehicles. This was on top of a P15 additional charge per kilometer for sedans, P18 for SUVs and P13 for hatchbacks—aside from the P2 charge per minute of travel. TNCs are also allowed to double their per kilometer and per minute charges through surge pricing.  But Gatchalian said Grab should also explain why it was imposing surge pricing even in the wee hours of the morning when there were fewer bookings and less traffic on the road. There should be more competitors for prices to go down, he added although he noted that while there were other TNVS companies, these were small players who could not go head-to-head with the current industry leader. “Without competition in the hail-riding industry, our poor commuters will always be at the mercy of high fares,” Gatchalian said. “This is why we are supporting the entry of other players in this industry, such as the TNVS GoJek, so that commuters would have choices and would not have to endure the high rates of Grab,” he added —With a report from Leila B.

These conditions, which are called voluntary commitments, took effect in August 2018 with the hopes that they would improve market conditions in a way that would feel as if Uber were still a competitor.  The voluntary commitments, which included keeping Grab’s fares close to how they were when Uber was still a competitor, were supposed to expire last Aug. 10. But instead of disclosing how Grab met or failed its yearlong commitments, the PCC said in a statement on Tuesday that the voluntary commitments would remain in effect for 71 days, or from Aug. 11 to Oct. 20. This will give time for the competition watchdog and the biggest player in the ride-hailing market so far to decide on new or amended commitments that will be effective for another period to be agreed upon.  The PCC said that the new commitments might include adjusted metrics to hold Grab in check for its price surges, driver discrimination through booking cancellations and service quality. “Exactly a year after PCC rendered a Commitment Decision on Grab’s acquisition of rival Uber on Aug. 10, 2018, the competition authority finds that the dominance of the merged firms remains unchallenged and competition has not improved in the ride-hailing market,” the statement read.  The market remains uncompetitive despite the entry of a number of transport network companies, which had big shoes to fill when Uber exited the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia. It was not clear, however, why the PCC chose to take this route despite noting that the market still has not recovered. Last year, PCC officials warned that failure to comply with these commitments would have been met with a fine of P2 million per breach, “or even the unwinding of the transaction” —a threat that might now seem unlikely for some given the long time since Uber’s exit. On one hand, the commitments could keep Grab in check from exercising its market power as a virtual monopolist, said PCC Chair Arsenio M. Balisacan. “On the other hand, we also advocate for allowing smaller players to grow or formidable new competitors to enter the market, which will be more beneficial to the riding public.” But this is not the only issue that faces the ride-hailing industry. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which regulates the ride-hailing industry, also faces charges under the Ease of Doing Business law, according to the Anti-Red Tape Authority (Arta).  This is in light of how the LTFRB handled the accreditation of transport network vehicle services (TNVS), which left an unnecessary long backlog that inconvenienced drivers, including Grab drivers who even held a protest against it. In a press briefing on Tuesday, Arta Director General Jeremiah Belgica said that some applicants even waited for their approval for a year, even though their applications have already been completed. He said that LTFRB board officials, including Chair Martin Delgra III, could be liable for not following the prescribed timeline of the law in processing applications and for imposing additional requirements. Whether or not Arta will push for this is not yet sure. Also on Tuesday, Arta said it has issued an order to automatically approve the TNVS applications that have been completed, duly paid and duly heard from July 7 last year to July 24, 2019. The Arta directed the LTFRB to submit a list of these TNVS applications three days after the agency received a copy of the order. Arta also recommended to remove some of the additional requirements such as a bank certificate of conformity."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/999719/grab-philippines-brian-cu-ltfrb-regulation-of-tncs","title":"Grab head welcomes LTFRB regulation of ride-hailing firms","date":"05:40 PM June 11, 2018","snippet":"Grab Philippines welcomed the signing of an order that allows the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate the ride-hailing firms in the country.","body":"Grab Philippines welcomed the signing of an order that allows the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate the ride-hailing firms in the country. “The new Department Order, which we welcome, strengthens Grab’s position that the fare structure with the P2 per minute component is legal,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement.  “Since the [issuance of] DO 2015-011, Grab has faithfully complied with the framework and the requirements imposed upon us by DOTr [Department of Transportation] and the LTFRB,” he added.

Kalanick disclosed Tuesday that he has sold off all his Uber stock — estimated at more than $2.5 billion — and is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties to the company he co-founded a decade ago.  “Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,” the 43-year-old entrepreneur said in a statement. Uber, based in San Francisco, transformed the way people get around and how they make a living, too, turbocharging the gig economy and undermining the taxi industry. Its nearly 4 million drivers around the globe have logged 15 billion trips since 2010, when Kalanick and Garrett Camp came up with the idea of hailing a ride from a smartphone after a trip to Paris when they couldn’t find a taxi.  But Kalanick was fired as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in lawsuits. Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, it ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be spinning out of control. Before his ouster as chief executive, Kalanick acknowledged he needed to “fundamentally change and grow up.”  His career at Uber seemed to fit a certain pattern seen in Silicon Valley: The brash and disruptive personalities who are great at creating startups can be ill-suited for the corner office when the company reaches maturity. Sometimes “adult supervision” in the form of experienced executives has to be brought in. In one of the Uber’s biggest scandals, Kalanick was accused of presiding over a workplace environment that allowed rampant sexual harassment. A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, leveled sexual harassment and sexism allegations in a 2017 blog post, saying a boss — not Kalanick — had propositioned her and higher-ups had ignored her complaints. Kalanick called the accusations “abhorrent” and hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate. Holder recommended reducing Kalanick’s responsibilities. After multiple investigations, Uber fired 20 employees accused of sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation against those who complained. This month, the company paid $4.4 million to settle a federal investigation over workplace misconduct. The problems went beyond employee relations.  Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, sued Uber in 2017, alleging a top manager at Google stole pivotal technology from the company before leaving to run Uber’s self-driving car division. Uber also gained a reputation under Kalanick for running roughshod over regulators, launching in markets before officials were able to draft rules and regulations to keep the ride-hailing business in check. During Kalanick’s tenure, The New York Times revealed that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber’s software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating. “Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror,” Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors. Kalanick, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed Tuesday. Kalanick is not alone among visionary tech entrepreneurs who have stumbled after building startups from nothing. Tesla founder Elon Musk has had too loose a grip on his Twitter habit and has been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors with a tweet. He was also sued for defamation, but ultimately cleared, for going on Twitter and calling a British cave explorer “pedo guy” — short for “pedophile.” Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, recently stepped aside after the workplace-sharing company canceled its initial public offering amid concerns about his judgment, including his use of WeWork stock to secure a $500 million personal loan. After Kalanick’s ouster, former Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought on as Uber’s chief executive to clean up its image and steer the company to its stock market debut in May. But Uber’s stock floundered and fell almost 11% in its first day of trading as a public company. It has tumbled more than 30% since. “Let’s call it like it is: Uber stock has been a nightmare since the IPO coming out of the gates,” Ives said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Kalanick had been one of Uber’s biggest shareholders, owning 9% of the company at the time of the IPO. Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research, said it was not surprising Kalanick sold his stake. “He, like everyone else, probably realizes now that Uber and its competitors are unlikely to reach sustainable profitability in the foreseeable future,” Abuelsamid said. “Automated vehicles are not the savior for ride hailing and won’t be mainstream for many years. With that in mind, his Uber stake is probably as valuable as it will get for a long time, if not forever.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/987950/new-ride-hailing-app-filo-to-debut-in-singapore","title":"New ride-hailing app Filo to debut in Singapore","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"Yet another ride-hailing app will enter the Singapore market soon, making it the third such company to move into the point-to-point transportation industry since the departure of Uber.","body":"Yet another ride-hailing app will enter the Singapore market soon, making it the third such company to move into the point-to-point transportation industry since the departure of Uber. Local start-up Filo Technologies, which was founded late last year, said it intends to launch its private-hire car booking services within the next two weeks.  It is up against local firm Ryde and India’s Jugnoo, which both debuted earlier in the week, and incumbent Grab, which acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia operations two months ago. Filo founder Jason Tan, 41, who is from the shipping and logistics industry, told The Straits Times yesterday (May 5) fares will be lower than those for taxis and comparable to other private-hire car services. Fares will also fluctuate based on demand and supply, he added.  To attract drivers, Filo will collect a 12 per cent commission – lower than Grab’s 20 per cent – which will be capped at S$400 (US$300) a month, said Mr Tan. He is currently recruiting 300 licensed private-hire car drivers to drive for his app – through social media and word of mouth – and aims to have 2,000 drivers in time for the launch. The company, based at Vision Exchange in Jurong East, has a start-up capital of S$50,000. Mr Tan said this money comes from his own pocket and investors, and he has plans to raise more funds.  His rivals currently have deeper pockets – Jugnoo has raised US$16 million, Ryde has US$1.5 million, and Grab, US$4.1 billion, according to tech website Crunchbase. Competition in Singapore’s ride-hailing sector looks set to get more intense, with firms such as Singapore’s MVL (Mass Vehicle Ledger) Foundation, Malaysia’s Dacsee and Indonesia’s Go-Jek looking to join the fray. Still, Mr Tan is undeterred. “The passenger-driver (matching) platform is just the start. We will have other more attractive services on the app in the coming days,” he said, but declined to reveal more. He is also promising attractive promotions for customers, but was tight-lipped about what they will be. “Based on my research, as long as there are no more than five players, the market should be able to accommodate all of them,” he added.  Asked about the sustainability of the new entrants, Mr Li Jianggan, founder of Momentum Works, a tech investment firm, said the companies could be counting on the Government regulating the ride-hailing industry in the future, to have more than one player. “At some point, this means regulating pricing and incentives.

Starting March 27, the ride-hailing company introduced a three-day water delivery service called Grab IGIB, in which customers in Marikina and two barangays in Quezon City can book vehicles to have water delivered to them.  Customers looking to slake their thirst, however, have to look elsewhere as the water Grab delivers is not potable. Grab IGIB is available to residents of Barangays Escopa III and Escopa IV in Quezon City; and Barangays Industrial Valley, Jesus de La Peña, Tañong, Santo Niño, Concepcion Dos, Nangka, Parang and Marikina Heights—all in Marikina—from March 27 to 29, 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., or until supplies last.  They just have to book a car and enter the Marikina Grab IGIB Water Hub as pickup point and their location as drop-off. The Grab IGIB app is found in Grab’s home feed, with location entered as drop-off point.  It is free of charge, with users paying only the cost of the ride, Grab said. Only one blue container, which contains 19 liters of water, is allowed per booking.

According to the study conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center of Energy and Environmental Policy Research (MIT CEEPR), around 74 percent of Uber and Lyft drivers in the U.S. are earning less than the minimum wage required in their respective states.  The study found from a survey of over 1,100 drivers that 30 percent are even losing money after vehicle and other expenses have been factored in. Drivers generally have a median profit of $3.37 per hour (about P175) before taxes.  In its defense, Uber criticized the study and told The Guardian that the study’s methodology is “deeply flawed.” Lyft also found some “questionable assumptions” after initial reviews of the study. Issues on labor standards and on the rights of drivers as independent contractors have also been raised.

Campos, Makati City’s 2nd district representative, said the Jakarta-based “Go-Jek” has more than 400,000 motor vehicles and drivers. He also said it is the “most popular ride-hailing app in the world’s fourth most populous country.”  “No matter how you look at it, the combination of the regional businesses of Uber and Grab not only reduces but effectively eliminates competition in the Philippine ride-hailing market,” Campos said in a statement. “To counteract the merger and reestablish competition, we may have to encourage other large suppliers such as Go-Jek to come in right away,” the deputy minority leader said.  Campos said he would have preferred that Uber, Grab and Go-Jek were “all here in the Philippines fiercely competing against each other.” “Three players are better than two. But if we can’t have three, two is better than one,” he said.  The lawmaker noted that in “ideal markets ruled by formidable anti-trust regulators,” a merger that gets rid of competition “may not be permitted until a substitute challenger comes in.” That was why lawmakers, Campos said, were counting on the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) to look into the Uber-Grab merger. “Assuming the deal qualifies as a covered transaction, then we expect the anti-trust body to perform its duty in ensuring that businesses compete and that consumers benefit,” Campos said. “The PCC is mandated by law to prohibit anti-competitive business agreements, abuses of dominant position, as well as mergers and acquisitions that lessen competition,” the lawmaker noted."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1209152/pimentel-endorsement-wont-influence-decision-after-pilot-test-run","title":"Koko endorsement won’t influence TWG decision on ride-hailing apps","date":"08:57 PM January 04, 2020","snippet":"","body":""},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/276393/the-cebu-city-councilor-who-sidelines-as-ride-hailing-driver","title":"The Cebu City Councilor who sidelines as ride-hailing driver","date":"December 22,2019 - 08:30 AM","snippet":"","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines — Traffic jam outside the CDN Digital office was horrible on a Friday afternoon, December 20, and one of the building’s employees said she was heading to SM Seaside City Cebu for an errand. No ride-hailing apps accepted the request for vehicle except for one with a driver whose picture looked very familiar. The app says the driver has a blue Suzuki Vitara and the fare is P200. The driver pulled over the driveway of the CDN building in Barangay Mabolo 15 minutes later. As his first passenger entered the vehicle, the driver looked away. When the second passenger came, this reporter who covers the Cebu City Hall beat, the driver lets out a laugh. “Nakakita man mo sa akong picture sa app no?” he says.  (You saw my picture on the ride-hailing app, right?) Behind the wheels of the car is Cebu City Councilor David “Dave” Tumulak, who earlier told City Hall reporters that he has applied to be driver for a ride-hailing app. That Friday afternoon, Tumulak says he just came from M.J Cuenco Avenue after a meeting. There is no more work for the day at his office at the Cebu City Hall so he decided to pick up passengers. That was when he received the request for a vehicle from the CDN Digital employee. ‘Driver for hire’ While he jokes about his government salary to be insufficient to pay for gas, Tumulak turned serious when asked why he decided to become a driver. “Sayang kaayo ang oras mag-drive from one meeting to the next. Daghan kaayong pasahero mag-atang. (Hours are wasted driving in getting from one meeting to the other) It is a waste of time and gasoline to drive alone. So may pa mag-driver ko aron makabayad ko sa gas (So I decided to become a driver so my earnings can pay for gas),” he tells CDN Digital. Tumulak reveals that he has been part of the ride-hailing app for two weeks. He applied in early December 2019 and was approved after two days. On Thursday, December 19, he earned P1,700, which is enough to have his tank filled with gasoline. And he is not even a full-time driver. His main mission in doing in being a driver is related to his role as a public servant. He enjoys driving around the city which also gives him the first-hand experience to see what is really happening on the road. It gives him the platform to better understand the plight of the drivers, whose livelihood are affected by the city’s worsening traffic situation. In these drives, he personally witnesses the experiences of motorists, pedestrians and commuters. Being a driver is his way of getting information, which he utilizes in formulating ordinances or legislations that will help the city government serve its constituents better. WATCH: David Tumulak answers questions from CDN Digital on the road  Passengers “Kun driver diay ka ba, madunggan man diay nimo tanan bisan og naa sila sa likod,” he shares with an amused voice. (When you are a driver, you can hear everything that your passengers talk about even when they are seated at the back.) He has since learned informative lessons and hilarious realities from his passengers. “Naay pasahero nga sabaan, medyo hugawan, sigeg panglibak, sigeg pagwapa,” says Tumulak. (There are passengers who are talkative, who are quite messy, who likes to gossip, or who uses the time on the road to put on make-up.) Some passengers have recognized him and when it happens, he gladly converses with them. Road issues That Friday, around 4 p.m. on the way to SM Seaside City Cebu, Tumulak pointed out that trucks were plying Sergio Osmeña Road on North Reclamation Area when there is an existing truck ban around that time. He points out the need to enforce measures such as the truck ban to make sure that efficient flow of traffic is observed with the expected holiday rush this month, December 2019. As the car moved forward to its destination, Tumulak noticed a light traffic situation at the South Road Properties (SRP) tunnel that afternoon while CDN Digital was on board his car. There were sacks, which might have fallen from a delivery truck, that were left unattended on the road. To resolve the situation, he called an official from the Cebu City Transportation Office in removing the sacks. He says this is one of the advantages of being a councilor-driver. Sitting as the Cebu City Council’s chairperson for the committee on disaster risk reduction and management, Tumulak is also able to conduct his own research that he can report to the body. He can easily respond to any incident while he is on transit. He gets to converse with his passengers, people from all walks of life, on the issues and challenges they face. As he receives the P200 payment for the drive, Tumulak showed off the money to this reporter. “Makapa-gas nako!” he says sounding victorious from a recent feat. (I can fill up my gas tank.) For Tumulak, being a driver is no different than being a councilor. Just like a councilor, a driver provides service to the public with the ultimate goal of providing convenience to passengers, a small but significant contribution to make their lives better. / dbs & celr"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/999683/tugade-signs-order-giving-ltfrb-authority-to-regulate-ride-hailing-firms","title":"Tugade signs order giving LTFRB authority to regulate ride-hailing firms","date":"04:33 PM June 11, 2018","snippet":"Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade has signed an order allowing the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate transport network vehicle services (TNVS) and transport network companies (TNCs).","body":"Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade has signed an order allowing the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate transport network vehicle services (TNVS) and transport network companies (TNCs).

Lizada said fares will be determined by the LTFRB after the conduct of a public hearing or consultation with the TNCs and TNVS.  LTFRB Chariman Martin Delgra III also assured the public that the agency is processing applications to make sure that no colorum vehicles would go out on the streets. “The LTFRB has been engaging with TNCs and TNVS operators and drivers far more often than any other group over the past year. It is because we see their value, and because we believe that if done right, they will make a big difference and our commuters will ultimately benefit,” Delgra said in a statement.  Tugade, for his part, said that putting TNVS and TNCs under LTFRB regulation would benefit all parties concerned. Moreover, he said competition will be fair as it will be a level playing field. According to Lizada, the department order, which was drafted last April, is effective immediately. In the past, fares were set by TVNS and TNCs. Under Department Order 2015-11 issued by then-Transport Secretary Joseph Abaya, the LTFRB only has an oversight function and can only step in to set fares during emergency situations. The LTFRB, however, disputed the validity of the order because it was implemented without their knowledge. /ee"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/252417/toyota-investing-1-billion-ride-hailing-company-grab","title":"Toyota investing $1 billion in ride-hailing company Grab","date":"01:11 PM June 13, 2018","snippet":"Tokyo — Japan’s top automaker Toyota Motor Corp. is investing $1 billion in Grab, the leading ride-hailing company in Southeast Asia, the company said Wednesday.","body":"Tokyo — Japan’s top automaker Toyota Motor Corp. is investing $1 billion in Grab, the leading ride-hailing company in Southeast Asia, the company said Wednesday.

Go-Jek announced last week that it had received series F funding from Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. and China-based conglomerate Tencent Holdings, with Mitsubishi Corp. and Provident Capital joining as investors.  Go-Jek did not disclose in its press statement the amount it raised, but sources quoted by Reuters said the value was at around US$1 billion. The funds raised would be used to help Go-Jek penetrate the market in Indonesia and strengthen its position in other countries, including Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand, the company wrote in the statement.  “As we expand internationally, we are excited to extend our vision to more countries and at the same time put Indonesia on the map as a regional hub for tech innovation,” said Go-Jek group CEO Nadiem Makarim in the statement. Go-Jek and its affiliates now operate in five countries in 204 cities and regencies across Southeast Asia, with a network of over 2 million driver partners and 400,000 merchants.  According to Go-Jek, its local brand in Vietnam, Go-Viet, gained an estimated 40 percent of the country’s two-wheeled transportation market share within three months of its launch in August 2018. The Indonesian unicorn opened its beta app in Singapore last month, while in Thailand, it launched its two-wheeled ride-hailing service by partnering with licensed motorcycle taxis. At the same time, ride-hailing app Grab has been stepping up its game in Indonesia and neighboring countries after its acquisition of the Southeast Asia operations of Uber, which decided to pull out from the region. Grab Indonesia managing director Ridzki Kramadibrata said Indonesia remained the company’s biggest market as its services were present in 222 cities, while Southeast Asia would continue to be a region of focus. Grab claimed it held a 60 percent market share of two-wheeled transportation and 70 percent of four-wheeled transportation in Indonesia.  Just like Go-Jek, Grab has continued to receive funding from big investors, including Japan-based conglomerate SoftBank Corp, Chinese tech giant Didi Chuxing and the venture capital arm of Japanese car maker Honda, among others. Donald Wihardja, deputy chairman of Venture Capital and Startup Indonesia Association (Amvesindo), said Go-Jek had the opportunity to compete with Grab in the regional market after successfully dominating the local one. “Foreign investors from the tech and real sectors believe that Go-Jek can dominate the Southeast Asian markets,” he said, adding that Go-Jek, after the latest funding round, was catching up with Grab in terms of company valuation. According to sources, Go-Jek’s company valuation is now at around $9 billion, while Grab is valued at $11 billion. Donald projected that the competition between Go-Jek and Grab would be long-term, and that the winner would be the one that would continue to raise funds for expansion. The founders of Go-Jek said in the statement that they would continue to influence decision-making and direction of the company, while maintaining its long-term vision and pushing for business expansion. As quoted in the Go-Jek press statement, Caesar Sengupta, general manager of payments and vice president leading the Next Billion Users initiative at Google, expressed his company’s confidence over Go-Jek’s vision. He said Google was “committed to supporting [Go-Jek’s] innovation and contribution to economic growth”."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/263349/ltfrb-indonesian-ride-hailing-firm-go-jek-cant-operate-in-ph","title":"LTFRB: Indonesian ride-hailing firm, Go Jek, can’t operate in PH","date":"05:28 AM January 10, 2019","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has rejected the application of Indonesian ride-hailing company Go Jek to operate in the Philippines over foreign ownership issues.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has rejected the application of Indonesian ride-hailing company Go Jek to operate in the Philippines over foreign ownership issues. Go Jek’s rejection further cements Grab’s hold on the Southeast Asian market, particularly in Manila, where the Singapore-based firm has captured 90 percent of the market, according to local anticompetition officials.  LTFRB Resolution No. 96 signed on Dec. 20 denied Go Jek’s application through its local subsidiary, Velox Technologies Philippines, for violating Section 11, Article 12 of the Philippine Constitution. According to the law, a public utility franchise should be issued only to companies that are 60-percent Filipino-owned. Velox Technologies’ articles show that it remains 99 percent owned by Singaporean citizens.  Under Department Order No. 2018-13, transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Grab are treated as public utilities because of their role in mass transport. Because of this, transport network companies like Go Jek must comply with the constitution which limits foreign equity to 40 percent, according  to communications director Goddes Hope Libiran of the Department of Transportation (DOTr).  While Grab hails from Singapore, its local subsidiary, MyTaxiPH, complies with the foreign ownership requirement. Should Go Jek reconstitute its ownership and board composition, it can appeal for reconsideration, Libiran said. Go Jek statement In a statement, Go Jek said the company “continues to engage positively with the LTFRB and other government agencies, as we seek to provide a much needed transport solution for the people of the Philippines.” With Go Jek facing a roadblock, the Philippine ride-hailing industry remains split among 10 players: Grab, u-Hop, Micab, Hype, e-Pick Me Up, Owto, Hirna, GoLag, Ryde and SnappyCab. Grab and u-Hop have yet to renew their accreditations.

But a Grab official warned that allowing that  many players without the government allowing more app-based vehicles to operate could actually spell more hassles than benefits for commuters.  Grab country head Brian Cu said only “two to three TNCs could survive” at the current cap of 66,750 set by the LTFRB. The number refers to the maximum number of vehicles that can use ride-hailing applications. “If you have too many TNCs that the TNVS (transport network vehicle services) need to attach themselves to, that supply will spread out. It would result in more difficulties in booking a car,” Cu said in an interview on Wednesday.  Uneven densities Because the cap fixes the number of app-based drivers on the road regardless of platform (Grab, Uber, for example), more TNCs would mean uneven “densities” of drivers as their networks thin out, he said.  “For example, if I book a car using Owto and it has 1,000 cars, it’s very unlikely that those cars are in a constricted area. Those cars would be all over Manila because that is where the demand would bring them. If the supply (of drivers) is spread out and the density is very low on a per TNC basis, people will find it harder to get a car.” Cu’s remarks follow the LTFRB’s accreditation of Micab, a Cebu-based taxi hailing app, on Monday. Alongside Hype, Hirna, Go Lag and Owto, this fifth TNC is expected to challenge Grab’s dominance in the country since its acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations. While stressing that he was not worried about Grab’s competitiveness in the market, Cu warned that the entry of several new players could actually cause an “overall network deficiency.” “If the current cap is concentrated within two or three TNCs, that’s OK. But once you get to five or six, the concentration becomes fragmented,” he said. Complaints vs Grab  Asked whether the regulatory agency would reopen discussions to adjust the cap for TNVS, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said they would first observe how the TNCs would be drawing from the current pool of available TNVS. Grab has come under fire of late amid mounting complaints from passengers, mostly about canceled bookings and difficulty in booking cars. This prompted the TNC to impose sanctions on almost 500 drivers. However, the company maintained that the root problem was the severe lack of app-based vehicles authorized to service passengers. To explain the undersupply, Cu said Grab received at least 600,000 booking requests every day but had only 35,000 vehicles in its fleet to serve riders. Of the 19,000 active Uber vehicles prior to the Grab acquisition, only 11,000 moved to Grab. At least 6,000 were not allowed to continue operating as TNVS as they were not part of the LTFRB’s masterlist, Cu said. Cu said the company had appealed to the LTFRB to allow the 6,000 drivers to be absorbed by Grab. “With an average of 12 rides a day, this is already an additional 72,000 rides, which can help ease the plight of riders,” he said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/206358/ride-hailing-app-grab-commits-to-ease-manilas-traffic-amid-regulatory-woes","title":"Ride-hailing app Grab commits to ease Manila’s traffic amid regulatory woes","date":"12:10 AM January 30, 2016","snippet":"SINGAPORE—Grab, a regional ride-hailing tech giant that allows passengers to book taxi rides and private cars on their smartphones, will continue to work with the Philippine government in helping solve traffic congestion in Metro Manila despite facing regulatory hurdles.","body":"SINGAPORE—Grab, a regional ride-hailing tech giant that allows passengers to book taxi rides and private cars on their smartphones, will continue to work with the Philippine government in helping solve traffic congestion in Metro Manila despite facing regulatory hurdles. Grab, which has been downloaded on 11 million smartphone devices and has expanded to six Southeast Asian countries since its launch in 2012, would continue to collaborate with regulators, including the Philippines that passed landmark ride-sharing regulations in 2015, co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan said on Thursday.  Grab was formerly GrabTaxi. “We want to find even better ways to help solve local traffic problems like in C-5 and Edsa. These are things that we think about a lot,” Tan, referring to two of Metro Manila’s most congested thoroughfares, said in a media event here where the company announced its rebranding.  Metro Manila’s multihour traffic jams have made headlines in the Philippines and abroad. The metropolis suffers from the effects of urban congestion, with its population of 12 million and ageing and inefficient mass transport systems like the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 that runs along Edsa. More recently, critics of the ride-sharing sector said these platforms were contributing to the traffic situation, citing passenger car sales that the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. said jumped almost 29 percent to 116,381 units in 2015.  Grab, which mainly competes with US-based Uber and traditional taxi services, has been rolling out new solutions to combat traffic but has faced challenges along the way. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) this week said it ordered the company to halt the operations of its popular GrabBike service, which ferries passengers using motorcycles. The LTFRB argued it has yet to issue guidelines allowing this service. Cheryl Goh, Grab vice president for regional marketing, said the company would continue discussions with the LTFRB on how to move regulations forward since GrabBike offered a solution to road congestion such as it did in other parts of the region like Indonesia. “Traffic in the Philippines is not a joke. But Indonesia is a monster. It has the worst traffic jams,” Goh told Manila-based media on the sidelines of the same event. “Winning in Southeast Asia means you have to convince governments. We need to work with them, you cannot be at war with them.” “Legislation needs to move [forward]. This is something that, through discussions, is possible,” she added.  Grab is also offering new features in line with its rebranding effort apart from the establishment of engineering centers, one each in Seattle, US, Beijing, China and Singapore. Grab, which is present in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, said it has about 200,000 drivers on its network servicing some 1.5 million bookings per day. The company claims to control about 95 percent of the market share in the third-party taxi booking app business and over 50 percent for private car booking in Southeast Asia. Apart from car and bike bookings, it offers last mile delivery via GrabExpress and GrabHitch, a carpooling service not yet available in the Philippines."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1282346/grab-to-implement-addtl-safety-measures-in-car-services-vs-covid-19-spread","title":"‘New normal’ ushers in Grab’s ‘no-touch policy’ in car services","date":"02:07 PM May 28, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Call it a chivalrous move, or maybe Grab drivers are just practicing self-care for the so-called “new normal”.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Call it a chivalrous move, or maybe Grab drivers are just practicing self-care for the so-called “new normal”. Once ride-hailing services of Grab Philippines resume, passengers will have to wear face masks at all times and will no longer be allowed to open and close the doors by themselves.  This, after Grab Philippines released on Thursday additional safety and hygiene protocols in its ride-hailing services to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) once it resumes its operations. In an online media forum, Grab head of Transport and Shared Services Ronald Roda said its car services will comply with the two-passenger limit and cashless payment.  Passengers and drivers will also be required to wear face masks at all times. Vehicles must also be disinfected at the end of every trip. Drivers must also install a barrier between them and passengers, Roda said.  Both drivers and passengers will also be allowed to cancel their trips, or what Roda called “valid cancellation,” if either of them is not wearing a face mask or not abiding by other safety protocols. “Effectively, … if the passenger does not have a mask or there’s more than two in a car, the driver is allowed to cancel the ride,” he said. Under its guidelines, Grab drivers will have to open and close the doors for passengers, as passengers will no longer be allowed to touch the doors themselves in order to minimize contact. Passengers will also not be allowed to book their rides for others for contact-tracing purposes. However, this rule may be set aside emergency cases. Grab cars will not be allowed to transport COVID-19 patients. “They are required to show their booking code to their respective driver-partner before entering their assigned vehicle. However, exceptions will be made in specific cases of emergencies wherein the destination is a hospital and the account holder or companion was the one who made the booking,” Grab said in its statement.  Eating and/or drinking will not be allowed inside the car, Roda said. Passengers and drivers will receive messages and notifications to remind them of the proper safety and hygiene protocol during their rides. “Our focus is on safety, and we are leveraging all the tech that is necessary to the point of having to remind both passengers and drivers all the time, with messaging on the app and pop-ups that there are new rules to be followed,” Roda said. Drivers have to undergo safety training before they will be allowed to ply the road again, Roda said. About 20,000 drivers are expected to be ready for deployment once transport network vehicle service (TNVS) units are once again allowed on the road upon the easing up of lockdown measures. Metro Manila and other “high-risk” areas have been under strict quarantine measures since March 17, which shifted to modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) starting May 15 to May 31. The further downgrading of quarantine measures, or the shift to general community quarantine (GCQ), is looming after the metropolis’ mayors as well as the Inter-Agency Task Force against Infectious Diseases (IATF) recommended such to the President.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Saturday issued a cease-and-desist order against OWTO as it had not yet been granted an accreditation to operate as a transportation network company (TNC).  OWTO, which presents itself as a “fair,” “safe” and “Filipino” TNC, should first consult with regulating bodies about the requirements for accreditation, according to LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada. “Before anyone offers anything to the general public, particularly these TNCs, they must present their business design to the regulatory body. That is the LTFRB,” Lizada told reporters on Saturday.  “They need to know what are the things and the requirements na dapat makita ng mga riders sa app. They cannot just do it on their own without consulting the proper government agency,” she stressed. Lizada said that the accreditation of TNCs are still open, but processing of applications for Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) providers are still suspended.  The new TNC was reported to have scheduled a press conference on Dec. 18 at Amo Gastropub on Tomas Morato Avenue in Quezon City. Lizada said the firm should postpone the conference. “To the organizers of OWTO, it is best that you coordinate with the LTFRB before you do any press conference, before you do any packaging, before you do any marketing, because you need to know the basic requirements the law requires,” Lizada said. In a Facebook page post on Dec. 5, OWTO branded itself as a TNC that would give riders “reasonable value-for-money fares.” “It also empowers the driving partners with equitable take-home pays through the company’s lower commission take-out schemes. Life is fair with OWTO, you know,” the company said. The firm added that it would commit and comply with the government’s rules and regulations for the “greater good of the public.”  “Christmas time is fast approaching. Guess who’s coming to town? It’s definitely not for the naughty ones but for the ones who play it nice,” the company said on Facebook.

After imposing a P5-million fine on ride-sharing companies Grab and Uber, the LTFRB said that by July 26, drivers face P120,000 in fine and their vehicles would be impounded for at least three months if found to be operating without a certificate of public conveyance or provisional license from the agency.  The LTFRB action came after agency officials met with representatives of the ride-hailing companies Uber, Grab and U-Hop on Tuesday. During the meeting, Grab and Uber representatives admitted they listed thousands of accredited drivers in their databases despite these drivers not having franchises to operate from the LTFRB.  In its new order on Tuesday, the LTFRB told the ride-hailing company representatives to “cease with dispatch” the operations of these drivers by July 26. Drivers claiming to be affiliated with Grab and Uber but without LTFRB franchises would be apprehended.  Aileen Lizada, LTFRB board member, said drivers with expired franchises but had applied for renewal would be allowed to continue using their cars as public conveyances. Lizada said they ordered the ride-hailing companies to submit before the end of the month their updated list of accredited drivers. Based on the LTFRB records, only more than 3,700 app-based drivers had been authorized to operate. But representatives said Grab and Uber had accredited at least 56,000 drivers. The LTFRB had wanted to revoke the accreditation of Grab and Uber because of several violations. Among these was the failure of the ride-hailing firms to screen drivers before endorsement to the LTFRB and the accreditation of drivers who don’t have franchises to use their cars as public conveyances. But because Grab and Uber serve a significant segment of the commuter population, the two were just fined P5 million, according to Lizada.  Also because more and more vehicles are packing Metro Manila’s already congested roads, the LTFRB asked the ride-hailing firms to help set a limit on the number of privately owned cars that should be allowed to be used as public conveyances. Of the 9.25 million registered cars in the entire country, 2.4 million are in the metropolis. —Jovic Yee"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1202866/senate-inquiry-into-alleged-abuse-poor-service-of-grab-ph-sought","title":"Senate inquiry into alleged ‘abuse, poor service’ of Grab PH sought","date":"04:19 PM December 18, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Senator Imee Marcos is pushing for an inquiry into the alleged “abuse and poor service” of ride-hailing company Grab Philippines.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Senator Imee Marcos is pushing for an inquiry into the alleged “abuse and poor service” of ride-hailing company Grab Philippines. Marcos filed on Wednesday Senate Resolution No. 283 urging the appropriate Senate panel to conduct an inquiry into the alleged “abuse and poor service of Grab PH and its effective monopoly of ride hailing services.”  “Various reports state that Grab prices (are) increasing to exorbitant amounts during the recent pre-Christmas holiday rush, with commuters experiencing more than double their usual fare,” the resolution read. “In addition to the high fares during the recent pre-Christmas holiday rush, Grab commuters also experience difficulties in booking a ride, with reports of booking times reaching about an hour, if they get a booking at all,” it added.  Under the mandate of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) as defined by the Philippine Competition Act, Grab’s acquisition of Uber in the Philippines was subjected to “quality and pricing standards in clearing the transaction which were part of the voluntary commitments signed by Grab to address the competition concerns raised by the antitrust authority,” Marcos noted in her resolution. “Commuters using Grab services have consistently complained that fares are becoming more expensive now, after Uber sold its business to Grab, leaving them with no other ride-hailing company to choose from,” she added.  The PCC recently imposed a P16.15-million fine on Grab Philippines for overpricing and cancellation of users’ rides.

But in one way it has been good for investors who snatched up the newly public companies’ stock: The losses have scared off the competition, giving the leaders a duopoly in almost every American city.  READ: Uber, Lyft drivers protest, go on strike across the US, overseas The two San Francisco companies have already lost a combined $13 billion. And with no clear road to profits ahead, no one else has much of an incentive to mount a challenge using the same model relying on people driving their own cars to pick up passengers that summon them on a smartphone app, said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.  Even if another rival dared enter the market, it would likely be difficult to raise enough money to pose a viable threat after Uber and Lyft spent the past decade pulling in billions of dollars from venture capitalists. And in the past six weeks, they raised an additional $10.4 billion in their recently completed initial public offerings of stock. “There’s only a duopoly because both companies have enough capital to compete with each other and no one else does,” said Gartner analyst Michael Ramsey.  It’s likely to remain that way until any of dozens of companies trying to create self-driving cars refines their technology so they can launch a network of robotic taxis that removes human drivers from the equation. That breakthrough could enable them to slash their fares below the prices currently being charged by Uber and Lyft. Google spin-off Waymo has made no secret of its intention to muscle its way into the ride-hailing market with a fleet of self-driving cars built on technology that it has been working on for the past decade. Waymo launched a ride-hailing service with robotic vans in the Phoenix area five months ago, but only 1,000 people are currently allowed to use it. Besides being on the leading edge of bringing robotic vehicles to market, Waymo also is backed by more money than Uber and Lyft have combined. Waymo is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., which is sitting on $113 billion in cash. In its IPO document, Uber listed Waymo as a potential threat along with Tesla, General Motors’ Cruise Automation and Apple. Lyft also cited Waymo and Apple among the companies that could undercut its position as the second largest ride-hailing service. But most experts believe it will still be many more years before self-driving car technology reaches the point that it can support a large fleet of robotaxis.  Until then, the U.S. duopoly is likely to continue, giving Uber and Lyft the luxury of focusing on growth rather than turning a profit, analysts said. That means ride-hailing fares in the U.S. are likely to remain below the actual cost of providing the service, a boon for consumers. “These subsidies will continue as long as each company believes they will be gaining new customers by having a lower price,” says Alejandro Ortiz, principal analyst at SharesPost. “The story now is growth, but growth is expensive.” Eventually, though, investor pressure will mount on the companies to make money, and doing that almost certainly will require higher prices for their rides. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi hinted that it will be three to five years before the company pivots to a focus on profit. That timetable hasn’t been well received on Wall Street so far. Lyft’s stock has fallen 29% below its IPO price of six weeks ago, and Uber flopped in its stock market debut Friday as its shares slipped by almost 8% percent. Markets with only one or two dominant players often create situations for companies to abuse their power or attempt to stifle competition. Regulators and legislators around the world argue that’s already happened in many corners of technology, with Facebook having a seemingly impenetrable stronghold in social networking, Google dominating search and Amazon controlling a wide swath of online shopping. That has stirred calls to break up some of the companies, especially Facebook, whose own co-founder, Chris Hughes, recently argued his former company has become too powerful for society’s good. For now, Uber and Lyft have been drawing upon all the money that they have raised from investors to keep prices relatively low, creating a barrier for smaller-scale competitors without the capital to sustain massive losses. Take Austin, Texas, for instance. In 2016, Uber and Lyft pulled out of the city after voters approved regulations on ride-hailing companies, including fingerprint background checks for drivers. Four competitors stepped in to give rides in tech-savvy Austin, including two local companies. But the following year, Texas legislators passed a looser state law that superseded Austin’s, and Uber and Lyft came back. Shortly after their return, three of the competitors, Boston-based Fasten, locally owned GetMe and Phoenix-based Fare stopped operations, and the remaining one, nonprofit RideAustin, lost thousands of its riders. “It was a matter of a couple months and those three companies were gone,” said Chris Simek, an associate research scientist with the Texas A&M University Transportation Institute, who co-authored a study of Uber and Lyft’s impact on ride-hailing in Austin.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Uber hasn’t been as successful thwarting competition outside the U.S. It has waved a white flag during the past three years in Russia , China and parts of Southeast Asia by selling its services in those parts of the world to stronger rivals.Lyft has not expanded outside North America yet, so it faces few other competitors besides Uber in the U.S. Via has managed to carve out a niche by running a pooled ride system in New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago, and it contracts to provide transit in about 70 cities worldwide. It competes most directly in New York, where Uber and Lyft also offer pooled services that transport multiple riders. Via specializes in carrying up to six passengers at a time, largely in vans, and is growing because it can do a more efficient job carrying more people, said spokeswoman Gabrielle McCaig. Still, the company is losing money as it invests in growing the business, she said. And so it remains, at least for now, that Uber and Lyft will occupy the ride-hailing industry’s driver’s seat. “It is hard to see a third or fourth player coming in at this point,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom White. “I think we are looking at a duopoly in North America.”"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/264192/passenger-in-cebu-shares-hilarious-ride-hailing-experience","title":"Passenger in Cebu shares hilarious ride-hailing experience","date":"October 15,2019 - 01:38 PM","snippet":"","body":" CEBU CITY, Philippines— Have you ever tried booking a ride but your driver arrives at your destination first before you even hop aboard?

These preparations, Grab country head Brian Cu said, are meant to address the physical distancing standards set by the country’s ad hoc task force on containing the coronavirus pandemic.  Grab, alongside other car-hailing services, were banned from operating starting March 16 when President Duterte declared a lockdown in Luzon that was thereafter enforced in other parts of the country. Short of an actual ban, Grab’s new rules said senior citizens, those below the age of 21, the sickly and pregnant women are “highly encouraged” not to leave, subject to exemptions by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases.  Other regulations are now standard, such as mandatory wearing of masks, deep disinfection per trip, and contactless transactions via GrabPay or through credit or debit cards. But others may be deemed drastic: Drivers are the only ones allowed to open and close doors. Passengers, in turn, are not allowed to book for other people anymore, in aid of effective contact tracing. A rider is required to show his or her booking code to the drivers.  Each car is only allowed two people at most, and both are required to sit close to the windows at the back of the vehicle. Passengers are allowed to cancel a ride if the driver is not wearing a mask. The company expects to deploy around 20,000 drivers during the first week of the general community quarantine. Country head Brian Cu allayed fears of similar “Christmastime” carmaggedon scenarios, when the demand for cars outpaced the available drivers on the road three-to-one.

Grab was monitored by the PCC for one year starting August 2018 and found that it had overcharged riders and its drivers canceled too many bookings from May to August this year.  The commission slapped fines on the company amounting to more than P39 million, largely for overcharging. It ordered that P19 million be refunded to customers, including the P14.15 million May-August 2019 overcharges. Because it had no real competitor, the PCC recently revised the conditions imposed on Grab to include a “disgorgement mechanism,” a process in which ill-gotten money is paid back or returned.  It said the P14.15 million must be paid back to Grab’s customers within 60 days and the P2 million to the agency within 45 days. Grab said it would comply but called the money to be returned to its riders a mere “disbursement.”  “As the new monitoring year begins with the new systemwide average monitoring scheme, Grab is hopeful in fulfilling its commitments to the PCC,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. It, however, added that “pricing will still be influenced by factors such as lack of supply, and the traffic situation.” The PCC tapped London-based audit firm Smith & Williamson to look into Grab’s operations for a year after it acquired Uber, then its only competitor in the ride-hailing business. When the disgorgement mechanism was announced last month, Grab insisted that it did not overcharge and only followed the fare matrix set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “You can be legalistic about it, but the point is you committed [to keep rates low]. In any case, the longer-term solution to this is really to have an effective competitor to Grab,” PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan told reporters in an interview earlier this month.  “[It has to be] another player, just like Uber, who has deep pockets, because from our analysis, none of these small players will be able to compete effectively with that kind of resources Grab [has],” Balisacan said. The PCC orders came as the price of booking a Grab ride in the middle of the day””not to mention during rush hours””this holiday season had skyrocketed. Noting complaints of exorbitant rates, a party list representative urged Grab to “moderate your greed” while a senator called for an investigation of its alleged poor services. In her resolution calling for the probe, Sen. Imee Marcos said that aside from the high rates, commuters also complained about difficulties in booking a ride from Grab. Grab explained that there were 3 million booking requests every day, based on data from last week. It said it could only serve 400,000 riders per day, with about 36,000 drivers on the road. Marcos said Grab was supposed to cap its fare increases this month at 22.5 percent of its average rate. The PCC had set a monthly fare cap for Grab based on its monthly fares before the company acquired Uber in March 2019. The agency said the cap rate was confidential but included a certain range within which Grab could still raise its fares. For most of the year, including this December, the range was up to 22.5 percent. Any excess was to be refunded to Grab customers. The LTFRB has summoned Grab over complaints of “unreasonable price surges” from passengers since the start of the holiday season.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra said he would look into alleged price-gouging, reminding transport operators to adhere to the approved fare matrix and a cap on surge rates. Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Rep. Jericho “Koko” Nograles on Wednesday said the LTFRB should ensure that Grab would solely shoulder any fines imposed on it, and not pass them on to customers. He expressed concern over the “excessive”commissions that Grab has been getting from its drivers. “Even just until the end of December, please moderate your greed. Leave some for your drivers,” he said. He said the charges that Grab had supposedly been imposing were taking a toll on its drivers, which was aggravated by the heavy holiday traffic. Nograles urged Grab to give discounts to its loyal riders and drivers during the Christmas season by lowering its surge prices. “Have mercy on the riding public who are left without a choice but use your ride-hailing services,” he said. —With reports from Leila B.

In the past year, he had used the app almost every day. He estimates that he has spent thousands of pesos on the premium hailing service for a faster commute in Metro Manila.  But on New Year’s Eve, he was surprised to see a refund of only P27 split in three tranches: P15, P9 and P3. “It was frustrating,” he said. “Obviously I had spent much more than what I got.”  He’s not the only one. Millions of Grab passengers on Tuesday had also received almost the same amount, as Grab rolled out the P19.4-million penalty imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) for charging beyond the acceptable fare-in-range during two separate monitoring periods. Each peso a user received stands for every P1,200 (for those who used the app in February-May) or P400 (May-August) he spent on the app.  PJ’s P27 rebate means he spent anywhere between P10,800 and P32,400 for the ride-hailing service. Beyond that, however, Commuters of the Philippines founder Julius Dalay said the recent rebate rollout was symptomatic of the government’s lax regulation of transport network companies (TNCs) like Grab, leaving passengers vulnerable to overcharging fares. While Grab maintains that it abides by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB)’s fare matrix, the variables in the fare (P2-minute travel fee and surge rate) means it sometimes go beyond the acceptable fare-in-range set by the PCC. “This is more a symptom of regulation not being strengthened,” Dalay said in an interview. “Both the LTFRB and the PCC need to coordinate and put in place a system where they can better monitor if Grab is overcharging its passengers.” The LTFRB earlier launched an initial investigation into Grab’s alleged price-gouging practices and found that a large number of the complaints it filtered were not instances of overcharging, but the result of severe traffic doubling the time rate of the fare matrix.  A large part of this is the surge component, which is computed by adding time and distance and multiplying it to up to 2x. Grab uses an estimated travel time to compute its fares upfront, which could make other fares seem like “overcharging.” The two sample fare breakdowns shown by the LTFRB to reporters illustrated as much. In one of the sample fares that cost P478, covering 12 kilometers under 49 minutes, Grab had “overcomputed” the distance rate at P187.80 (P12x15 should have been P180) and the time rate at P122 (P49x2 should have been P98), but had adjusted the surge rate by P181. Another trip that cost P439, which took 43 minutes covering 10 km “undercomputed” its time rate: P62 (should have been P86). It then “overcomputed” its distance rate by P1.20. It’s why the initial results are inconclusive, said LTFRB technical division chief Joel Bolanos. For the LTFRB to charge Grab of overcharging, it must have proof that the excess computations are systematic, not outliers. Dalay added that there was also an issue with the way the rebates were rolled out. Passengers have no way of knowing if the rebates matched their actual expense. “The way that the rebates were computed is not transparent. There’s no counterchecking. While Grab can claim they have a system in place, people should still have the capacity to know how the rebates was obtained,” he said. Moving forward, he also urged Grab and other TNCs to be more transparent with their fare breakdowns so commuters can verify for themselves if they are being overcharged. “This is not only for the benefit of the passengers but also for them. So that when the time comes and regulators again question discrepancies, they can easily pinpoint where overcharging has taken place,” he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1111756/grab-imposing-p50-fine-for-cancelled-bookings-no-shows","title":"Grab imposing P50 fine for cancelled bookings, no-shows…","date":"03:53 PM April 29, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Passengers of ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines who will cancel after five minutes of a confirmed booking or those who do not show at their pick-up points after five minutes will be fined P50.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Passengers of ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines who will cancel after five minutes of a confirmed booking or those who do not show at their pick-up points after five minutes will be fined P50. “Grab is mindful that cancellations are frustrating for both the passengers and our drivers. At the same time, we are cognizant of the fact that sometimes, cancellations are necessary during special situations,” Grab President Brian Cu said in a statement.   Grab Philippines on Monday said its new policy is aimed at reducing unreasonable cancellations for drivers and passengers.  “Our intention in implementing this new policy is to create a better ride-hailing ecosystem, where both passengers and drivers practice the responsible use of the Grab platform,” he added. Grab said the cancellation fees incurred will go directly to the driver to compensate them for fuel and effort they have spent travelling to the location of the passenger.  The cancellation fee and no-show fees, however, will not be applied to passengers if the ride is cancelled within five minutes of getting an assigned a driver, if the driver is not moving towards the pick-up point, if the driver takes 15 minutes longer than the first estimated time of arrival, and if the driver indicates that he has arrived when he or she has not. The ride-hailing company said it is willing to refund any fees that were charged wrongly within 48 hours. The updated policy is effective on Monday, April 29, but Grab said is doing a staggered toll out to both passengers and drivers, which will be completed by the end of May. Among the other policies the ride-hailing company put in place to further discourage cancellations include: For drivers:  For passengers: Meanwhile, passenger’s accounts could be suspended for 24 hours should they cancel a ride twice in an hour, thrice in a day or a total of five cancellations in a week, Grab said. Drivers will also be penalized or locked out of the platform if they excessively ignore or cancel passenger bookings without proper reason and for being selective of passenger destinations. Grab said it has notified the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) about its new cancellation policy.  /gsg"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1138334/cebu-drivers-wont-join-metro-manila-tvns-strike","title":"Cebu drivers won’t join Metro Manila TVNS strike","date":"07:10 PM July 05, 2019","snippet":"CEBU CITY–Drivers in Cebu of cars enrolled in ride-hailing apps will not join their counterparts in Metro Manila in a strike on Monday (July 8).","body":"CEBU CITY–Drivers in Cebu of cars enrolled in ride-hailing apps will not join their counterparts in Metro Manila in a strike on Monday (July 8). Cebu drivers said while they sympathized with their Metro Manila colleagues, they didn’t want to inconvenience commuters.  “A lot of passengers will be affected,” said Michael Malaque, a spokesperson for a group of drivers enrolled in Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) companies. Malaque said not only passengers but also drivers’ incomes would be hurt by the strike. “So what we will do is just ask the government to hear us out,” he said.  Malaque said his group wrote instead to President Rodrigo Duterte and Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade seeking an increase in the number of certificates of public convenience (CPC) for vehicles enrolled in TVNS apps without requiring their owners to obtain franchises. The drivers said they are appealing to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to shorten the process of issuing the certificates.  Drivers currently wait up to six or more months for the certificates. At least 3,000 vehicles enrolled in TVNS apps currently ply Cebu. Majority have no certificates of public conveyance. Only 500 vehicles had been issued certificates. In their letter, the drivers appealed for the issuance of at least 3,000 certificates. The LTFRB earlier announced that at least 1,500 vehicles were at risk of being deactivated by ride-hailing app firm Grab for lack of papers. In a separate interview, LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III said the number of certificates for Cebu would stay at 1,500 which had all been taken already. Informed of the Cebu drivers’ appeal, Delgra said he has yet to receive a formal request.  “If there is a problem, let us talk,” Delgra said. “Let us not inconvenience the public by staging a transport holiday which is similar to a transport strike,” said Delgra, who is in Cebu for the launch of a government driver scholarship program.

Ride-hailing newbie Micab encounters problems in expanding in PH","date":"05:16 AM July 27, 2018","snippet":"Ride-hailing newcomer Micab is struggling to expand operations this year, saying its drivers have been hesitating to take ride requests due to over 29,000 phantom bookings it had alleged to Grab Philippines.","body":"Ride-hailing newcomer Micab is struggling to expand operations this year, saying its drivers have been hesitating to take ride requests due to over 29,000 phantom bookings it had alleged to Grab Philippines. Micab CEO and cofounder Eddie Ybañez said the company had received enough commitments from taxi operators to scale their current pool of drivers to 15,000 in September from the current 6,500.  The problem, however, is that its entry has been mired by so-called phantom bookings that began in June. Rides are booked, but later cancelled. As a result, drivers became less willing to activate the Micab app because of the phantom bookings, which nearly doubled in two months’ time, from 15,000 in June to more than 29,000 this month, he said.  Micab, one of the few transport network company (TNC) entrants accredited in April, was part of the promise to keep the market competitive. It was supposed to give consumers a choice, after Grab became a monopoly through a regional takeover of rival Uber. Micab first recognized these phantom bookings by looking into passenger accounts that have cancelled at least three times in short intervals.  But before the company could stop these phantom bookings, its drivers would have already wasted time and fuel, an unnecessary cost just when the prices of basic goods are increasing. “They’ll switch on the meter only when the passenger finally gets in. So the risk actually is that the driver goes there and then there is no one there,” he said, noting there were no refunds in these cases. Most of these bookings were then followed by a call recruiting the Micab driver to switch to Grab, he said. The person on the other line would even give a counteroffer. These calls came from cellphone numbers that have “sequential” last digits, suggesting the accounts were bought in bulk, the official said. “Our conclusion is this is just one entity. It’s like a campaign,” he said. To address the issue, Ybañez said the company had recently used an algorithm automatically banning phantom bookings after three cancellations done in short intervals.  He said they were still monitoring the results. The problem, however, is that people behind this campaign can register new numbers. Asked if Micab has already reached out to authorities, he said a legal team was still examining options. If the issue is not resolved by the app’s algorithm, the best they could do is to “minimize” the number of incidents, he said. Nevertheless, the Cebu-based cofounder is only asking for fair play. “We just want this to stop,” he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1505516/lyft-records-more-than-4000-sexual-assault-cases-in-long-overdue-safety-report","title":"Lyft records more than 4,000 sexual assault cases in long-overdue safety report","date":"05:05 AM October 23, 2021","snippet":"Lyft Inc received reports of more than 4,000 instances of sexual assault on its ride-hailing platform between 2017 and 2019, it said, detailing the data in a safety report it had promised to publish about two years ago.","body":"Lyft Inc received reports of more than 4,000 instances of sexual assault on its ride-hailing platform between 2017 and 2019, it said, detailing the data in a safety report it had promised to publish about two years ago. The company report, issued late on Thursday, showed sexual assault reports on its platform had increased from around 1,100 in 2017 to some 1,800 in 2019. But it said bookings increased at a higher rate during that time, resulting in a 19% drop in the overall incident rate.  Lyft said more than 99% of its journeys had occurred without any safety incident. “While safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we realize that even one is too many. Behind every report is a real person and real experience, and our goal is to make each Lyft ride as safe as we possibly can,” Jennifer Brandenburger, head of policy development and research, said in a company blog post.  The company said it has invested in safety features, employed rigorous driver background checks, and consulted sexual assault experts. Lyft had committed to releasing its report at the end of 2019, when its larger rival Uber Technologies Inc provided the ride-hailing industry’s first detailed safety report.  Uber at the time disclosed it had received some 6,000 reports of sexual assault related to 2.3 billion trips in the United States in 2017 and 2018. Lyft, which services significantly fewer trips than Uber, did not disclose the total number of rides it completed in its Thursday safety report, but at 0.0002% the incident rate was the same as Uber’s. Unlike Uber, Lyft did not disclose what share of incidents resulted in drivers being harmed.

Signed on Tuesday, the board’s Memorandum Circular No. 2018-19 also ordered all TNCs to issue electronic receipts showing the fare breakdown.  The order would take effect 15 days after its publication in a national newspaper, according to LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III. The memorandum is applicable only to TNCs with transport network vehicle services (TNVS) or private vehicles that can be booked for solo or carpooled rides. Of the six ride-hailing apps accredited by the LTFRB, only Grab and local players Owto and Hype offer TNVS.  Fare components The others — GoLag, Micab and Hirna — are taxi-hailing TNCs which already have the P2-per-minute travel fee integrated into their fares following the recalibration of their meters, a process which started in July.  At present, all TNCs share the same fare components: a P40 base fare, a P10- to P14-per-kilometer rate, a price surge of up to two times the regular rate, and the now-authorized travel rate. The LTFRB memorandum also meant that Grab, which was earlier ordered to pay a fine of P10 million for unilaterally imposing the P2-per-minute travel fee, could now reinstate it. Drivers complain Grab drivers earlier complained that since the suspension of the travel charge in April, their income had dropped considerably due to rising fuel prices. The memorandum was issued on the same day the board reversed a July 9 order directing Grab to reimburse passengers who were charged the travel fee through rebates for future rides.  However, the LTFRB stood firm on the P10-million fine it imposed on the company. In reaction, Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said the TNC would file an appeal in connection with the stiff penalty, this time in the Department of Transportation. The board’s decision authorizing the travel rate partly stemmed from calls made by House transportation committee chair and Catanduanes Rep. Cesar Sarmiento, Muntinlupa Rep. Ruffy Biazon and Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo on behalf of the drivers. For TNVS coalition head Winson Esteras, having the fee approved was just the first step in keeping drivers’ incomes sustainable amid fuel price increases and rising inflation."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1126811/manic-monday-for-riders-as-grab-loses-8k-drivers","title":"Manic Monday for riders as Grab loses 8K drivers","date":"05:03 AM June 05, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab passengers should brace themselves for longer booking periods and higher price surges starting on Monday as the ride-hailing giant removes from its platform some 8,000 drivers who failed to apply for the renewal of their franchise by June 7.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab passengers should brace themselves for longer booking periods and higher price surges starting on Monday as the ride-hailing giant removes from its platform some 8,000 drivers who failed to apply for the renewal of their franchise by June 7.

Grab’s surge pricing during the morning rush hour on Monday shocked a number of commuters, who were forced to look for other means of transportation just to get to work.  One of them was Joyce Yu who opted to take the bus from North Avenue to Ortigas since Grab was charging her P450 for the trip that usually costs her up to P250 only. Several netizens also took to Twitter to express their disappointment over Grab’s high fares, which range from P300 to P600. A 6.5-kilometer trip from Makati to Manila at 8 a.m., for example, set back riders by almost P300, when hours earlier the same trip only cost around P150.  Last week, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Grab to “immediately” bring down its surge pricing cap from twice the regular rate to just 1.5 times, while the government processes the accreditation of new TNCs that would take the place of Uber. Grab government communications manager Fiona Nicolas said that while they have already implemented the new surge rate that the LTFRB imposed, fares may remain high in in the interim because of the limited number of drivers that are currently in their system.  “The onboarding of TNVS (transport network vehicle services) is not yet at 100 percent while most, if not all, Uber passengers have already downloaded the Grab app. The onboarding [of drivers] from Uber to Grab is still ongoing,” Nicolas said. Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu earlier explained that while there has been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in their system only rose by around 30 percent. On Monday, the Uber app went offline in the country following Grab’s acquisition of its former rival’s Southeast Asian operations. This was also in compliance with the LTFRB’s directive to Uber to cease its operations as a TNC, despite an earlier order from the Philippine Competition Commission that it continue to serve the public for the duration of the motu propio review on the deal. To protect the public from Grab’s exorbitant fares, the National Center for Commuters Safety and Protection called on the LTFRB to expedite its accreditation of new TNCs Lag Go, Hype and Owto to provide the riding public an alternative.  “It is incumbent on the LTFRB to approve these applications. We think that LTFRB should hurry up so that there will be competition,” the group’s head Maricor Akol said.

A waiter at a barbecue restaurant in Kansas City, Missouri, washes his hands more often and hopes for the best. A parcel delivery driver in Britain worries about getting sick from the people who sign for their packages. While white collar workers trying to avoid contagion can work from home or call in sick if they experience symptoms of the virus, such precautions are not an options for the millions of waiters, delivery workers, cashiers, ride-hailing drivers, museum attendants and countless others who routinely come into contact with the public.  Their dilemma is compounded by spotty sick leave policies or inadequate health insurance coverage, which leave them vulnerable to the fast-spreading coronavirus that has already claimed thousands of lives and put them in a financially precarious position. “The recommendations on what people should be doing to protect themselves really gives a sharp indication of the divide between white collar and blue collar workers,” said Shannon Liss-Reardon, a workers rights attorney in Boston. “Our social safety net is just not equipped at this moment to deal with a crisis like this, and it will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable low wage workers.”  While tech companies like Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have implemented work-from-home policies, only 29% of U.S. workers have that option, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That means retail workers like Mendy Hughes must fend for themselves. The Walmart cashier in Malvern, Arkansas, serves hundreds of people a day and her big worry is what will happen to her income if she catches the virus or comes in contact with someone who’s had it and must self-quarantine for 14 days. “If I can’t go to work, I could try to take a leave but it will be unpaid,” said Hughes, who earns $11.60 an hour. “I don’t know what I would be doing about taking care of my family.”  Hughes, a diabetic and mother of four, gets 48 hours of sick leave a year but she fears it wouldn’t be nearly enough time to recover. In the United States, about 27% of private sector workers don’t have access to paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some countries, like Britain, are looking into helping out its non-permanent workers. There is no federal sick leave policy in the U.S., but 12 of the 50 states and Washington D.C. require employers to offer paid sick leave. Some House and Senate Democrats have been pushing legislation that would require employers to allow workers to accrue seven days of paid sick leave and to provide an additional 14 days in the event of any public health emergency, including the current coronavirus crisis. President Donald Trump said he was seeking help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they’re “not going to miss a paycheck,” and he would outline the proposals Tuesday. In Britain, parcel delivery driver Ed Cross worries about catching the virus from the machine he hands people who sign for their packages. “People have coughed on their hand and then got hold of my machine and you sort of make a joke of it trying to point it out,” Cross, 53, said. “But yeah, it’s what we face daily.”  “We only have to go to the wrong house and we could catch it, as simple as that,” said Cross, who on a recent day handed packages to 110 people on his route in Whitby, northern England. The British government last week made it easier to collect statutory sick pay and is working on changes to help millions of non-permanent workers like Cross who aren’t eligible for it. In a sign the industry is waking up to the problem, his parcel company, Hermes, announced a 1 million pound ($1.3 million) fund to help couriers who need to self-isolate. Uber, meanwhile, said it would compensate drivers and couriers for up to 14 days if they get sick or have to be quarantined. The viral outbreak has revealed gaping holes in health care coverage at a time when people may need it most. Most European countries and Canada have universal healthcare systems, but the U.S. relies on a patchwork of public and private insurance. About 69% of private industry workers in the U.S. have access to healthcare benefits, but that drops to 43% of service workers. U.S. employers with 50 or more employees are required to offer health insurance. But the same protection isn’t provided to part-time workers or independent contractors. Waiter Joey Ingham, who works at a barbecue restaurant in Kansas City, Missouri, popular with business travelers, says he doesn’t have insurance. His protection? Washing his hands more often. “If I wasn’t able to come into work, it would be hard to make ends meet,” said Ingham, who waits on 80 to 120 people a shift. If he felt sick, he’d “probably talk to a manager” about what to do, but noted management hasn’t yet outlined any policies. Liss-Reardon said most gig workers — independent or temporary contractors — she represents don’t have health insurance. “We won’t have a fully insured population until we get universal healthcare,” he said. “There are going to be these huge gaps. The burden is falling on the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. This is just another example.” The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends workers without insurance contact a local health department or community health center for help. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends emergency room visits only for patients who are very sick. In France, where people have the right not to work and get full pay when they consider their workplaces to be dangerous, some service staff briefly stayed home because of contagion concerns. Workers at the Louvre, the world’s most-visited museum, refused to work for two days and were only coaxed back after management introduced a raft of new anti-virus measures.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “We are asking for gloves. We are asking for disinfectant gels, and masks for the drivers,” said Bastien Berthier, of the Paris metro’s UNSA union. In China, where the outbreak has been raging for two months, many service industry workers have it far worse, with business evaporating as people are forced to hunker down at home. A barber in Beijing who would give only his surname, Long, said he is supporting his wife and child by charging food and other expenses to a credit card while he waits for his employer to reopen. “I can ask for sick leave or compassionate leave, but I get nothing without working,” said Long, 33. Jiang Yanlin, a tour guide in eastern China’s Huangshan region, said she hasn’t earned anything since mid-January and doesn’t have any social welfare benefits to fall back on. Usually she can earn up 300 yuan ($42) a day during the normally busy Lunar New Year holiday. “If I don’t work, I don’t get paid. Everyone here in the Huangshan tourist zone is like this,” said Jiang, 33. “No one is coming to travel.

LTFRB earlier announced that the government has allowed the extension of Angkas’ pilot run for another three months and gave two new operators the right to participate. But the regulatory body likewise imposed a 10,000-biker limit per transport network company (TNC) for Metro Manila and 3,000 bikers per TNC for Metro Cebu.

A waiter at a barbecue restaurant in Kansas City, Missouri, washes his hands more often and hopes for the best. A parcel delivery driver in Britain worries about getting sick from the people who sign for their packages. While white collar workers trying to avoid contagion can work from home or call in sick if they experience symptoms of the virus, such precautions are not an options for the millions of waiters, delivery workers, cashiers, ride-hailing drivers, museum attendants and countless others who routinely come into contact with the public.  Their dilemma is compounded by spotty sick leave policies or inadequate health insurance coverage, which leave them vulnerable to the fast-spreading coronavirus that has already claimed thousands of lives and put them in a financially precarious position. “The recommendations on what people should be doing to protect themselves really gives a sharp indication of the divide between white collar and blue collar workers,” said Shannon Liss-Reardon, a workers rights attorney in Boston. “Our social safety net is just not equipped at this moment to deal with a crisis like this, and it will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable low wage workers.”  While tech companies like Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have implemented work-from-home policies, only 29% of U.S. workers have that option, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That means retail workers like Mendy Hughes must fend for themselves. The Walmart cashier in Malvern, Arkansas, serves hundreds of people a day and her big worry is what will happen to her income if she catches the virus or comes in contact with someone who’s had it and must self-quarantine for 14 days. “If I can’t go to work, I could try to take a leave but it will be unpaid,” said Hughes, who earns $11.60 an hour. “I don’t know what I would be doing about taking care of my family.”  Hughes, a diabetic and mother of four, gets 48 hours of sick leave a year but she fears it wouldn’t be nearly enough time to recover. In the United States, about 27% of private sector workers don’t have access to paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some countries, like Britain, are looking into helping out its non-permanent workers. There is no federal sick leave policy in the U.S., but 12 of the 50 states and Washington D.C. require employers to offer paid sick leave. Some House and Senate Democrats have been pushing legislation that would require employers to allow workers to accrue seven days of paid sick leave and to provide an additional 14 days in the event of any public health emergency, including the current coronavirus crisis. President Donald Trump said he was seeking help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they’re “not going to miss a paycheck,” and he would outline the proposals Tuesday. In Britain, parcel delivery driver Ed Cross worries about catching the virus from the machine he hands people who sign for their packages. “People have coughed on their hand and then got hold of my machine and you sort of make a joke of it trying to point it out,” Cross, 53, said. “But yeah, it’s what we face daily.”  “We only have to go to the wrong house and we could catch it, as simple as that,” said Cross, who on a recent day handed packages to 110 people on his route in Whitby, northern England. The British government last week made it easier to collect statutory sick pay and is working on changes to help millions of non-permanent workers like Cross who aren’t eligible for it. In a sign the industry is waking up to the problem, his parcel company, Hermes, announced a 1 million pound ($1.3 million) fund to help couriers who need to self-isolate. Uber, meanwhile, said it would compensate drivers and couriers for up to 14 days if they get sick or have to be quarantined. The viral outbreak has revealed gaping holes in health care coverage at a time when people may need it most. Most European countries and Canada have universal healthcare systems, but the U.S. relies on a patchwork of public and private insurance. About 69% of private industry workers in the U.S. have access to healthcare benefits, but that drops to 43% of service workers. U.S. employers with 50 or more employees are required to offer health insurance. But the same protection isn’t provided to part-time workers or independent contractors. Waiter Joey Ingham, who works at a barbecue restaurant in Kansas City, Missouri, popular with business travelers, says he doesn’t have insurance. His protection? Washing his hands more often. “If I wasn’t able to come into work, it would be hard to make ends meet,” said Ingham, who waits on 80 to 120 people a shift. If he felt sick, he’d “probably talk to a manager” about what to do, but noted management hasn’t yet outlined any policies. Liss-Reardon said most gig workers — independent or temporary contractors — she represents don’t have health insurance. “We won’t have a fully insured population until we get universal healthcare,” he said. “There are going to be these huge gaps. The burden is falling on the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. This is just another example.” The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends workers without insurance contact a local health department or community health center for help. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends emergency room visits only for patients who are very sick. In France, where people have the right not to work and get full pay when they consider their workplaces to be dangerous, some service staff briefly stayed home because of contagion concerns. Workers at the Louvre, the world’s most-visited museum, refused to work for two days and were only coaxed back after management introduced a raft of new anti-virus measures.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “We are asking for gloves. We are asking for disinfectant gels, and masks for the drivers,” said Bastien Berthier, of the Paris metro’s UNSA union. In China, where the outbreak has been raging for two months, many service industry workers have it far worse, with business evaporating as people are forced to hunker down at home. A barber in Beijing who would give only his surname, Long, said he is supporting his wife and child by charging food and other expenses to a credit card while he waits for his employer to reopen. “I can ask for sick leave or compassionate leave, but I get nothing without working,” said Long, 33. Jiang Yanlin, a tour guide in eastern China’s Huangshan region, said she hasn’t earned anything since mid-January and doesn’t have any social welfare benefits to fall back on. Usually she can earn up 300 yuan ($42) a day during the normally busy Lunar New Year holiday. “If I don’t work, I don’t get paid. Everyone here in the Huangshan tourist zone is like this,” said Jiang, 33. “No one is coming to travel. Everyone is so scared.” For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III’s endorsement of JoyRide had “no bearing” on its decision to include the transport network company (TNC) in the pilot test for motorcycle taxis, the interagency technical working group (TWG) overseeing the study said. In a statement issued on Saturday night, the TWG also accused advocacy group Lawyers for Commuters Safety and Protection (LCSP) of kowtowing to the interests of ride-hailing service Angkas rather than average commuters.  LCSP condemned the TWG in a press conference on Friday for alleged “irregularities” and threatened to file charges against its members. The group had also asked a Quezon City court last month to stop five TNCs, including JoyRide, from joining the pilot test. “The TWG will not be deterred by threats of lawsuits and charges of corruption,” it said in a statement on Facebook. “It will continue to discharge its function as mandated by the government, and ensure that the only interest it will uphold and serve is public interest.”  Its statement first pushed back against allegations that Pimentel had improperly interfered on behalf of JoyRide, saying that interested TNCs were all subjected to “a strict inspection and deliberation process.” “We, therefore, find it deplorable that the LCSP would resort to a politically motivated deflection of the real issue confronting the program, and will even drag a senator into the fray,” it added.  Motorcycle taxis are still illegal under current transportation laws, and the TWG is running the pilot study to determine their safety and viability as a means of public transportation. JoyRide and MoveIt joined Angkas, previously the sole player in the study, this year. This second phase of the test has been mired in controversy after the TWG capped the number of drivers Angkas could deploy at 10,000, compared to 27,000 riders in 2019. New player JoyRide has also been hounded by allegations that administration politicians have a stake in the company. “Let it be clear that with or without any endorsement letter, the TWG has been fairly dealing with how best to make the motorcycle taxi service pilot run reflective of the needs of the commuter, and how it can be a transformational public transportation alternative,” the TWG said. After defending Pimentel, the TWG then trained its ire on LCSP and Angkas, asking whether senators who had similarly advocated on its behalf should be “imputed with influence-peddling and favoring Angkas as well.” The TWG then accused LCSP of representing Angkas’ interests and not commuters.  “Angkas, using the LCSP, is trying to paint a picture that the TWG is involved in corruption in the conduct of the extended study on the viability and safety of motorcycles as taxis, citing vague allegations of ‘serious irregularities’ in the selection of new participants,” it said. The TWG, headed by retired Police Maj. Gen. Antonio Gardiola Jr., also alleged that Securities and Exchange Commission records showed Angkas was 99.996-percent owned by a Singaporean, Angeline Xiwen Tham. Philippine law requires that common carriers be at least 60-percent owned by Filipinos. It also listed other purported instances that allegedly proved Angkas was a serial violator of the law, including conducting business outside the designated pilot run areas, failing to require that passengers wear helmets and collecting disallowed surge fees."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/915266/ltfrb-cant-apprehend-colorum-grab-uber-drivers-yet","title":"LTFRB can’t apprehend ‘colorum’ Grab, Uber drivers yet","date":"04:25 PM July 19, 2017","snippet":"The operations of ride-hailing companies managing Grab and Uber will continue while the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is deliberating the appeal of the private firms to reconsider the service ban.","body":"The operations of ride-hailing companies managing Grab and Uber will continue while the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is deliberating the appeal of the private firms to reconsider the service ban.

The city’s transportation agency, Transport for London, said Friday that it would not renew Uber’s license when it expires Sept. 30, citing a lack of corporate responsibility. The agency said the factors it considered included Uber’s “approach to reporting serious criminal offenses” and its use of software designed to evade the authorities.  Khan said in a statement that it would be wrong “to license Uber if there was any way this could pose a threat to Londoners’ safety or security.” Uber has long been a target of complaints from taxi drivers and companies. Cab drivers say Uber drivers don’t have to comply with the same licensing standards, giving the ride-hailing service an unfair advantage and placing the public at risk.  Uber said it plans to appeal and accused London’s regulator of caving in to special interests “who want to restrict consumer choice.” It can keep operating in the city pending the outcome of the appeal. More than 500,000 people have signed an online petition protesting the decision not to renew Uber’s license.

The general director of land transportation, Djoko Sasono, said on Thursday evening that the ministry had issued a prohibition letter signed by transportation ministry Ignatitus Jonan on Nov. 9.  “Following the rise in the number of motor vehicles that are not official public transportation and carry people and goods based on internet applications, we took actions to prohibit them,” he said at a press conference on Thursday evening as reported by kompas.com. “Whatever the name, the operations similar to Go-Jek, Go-Box, GrabBike, GrabCar, Blue Jek, Lady Jek are all prohibited.”  He said that that the operation of application-based transportation did not meet the requirements of a 2009 law on traffic and public transportation and a 2014 government regulation on public transportation. The Ministry also sent the prohibition letter to the National Police and all local administrations and local police across the country.  “The requirements of public transportation are [that the vehicles] have at least three wheels, have legal standing and possess a public transportation business permit,” he said. Djoko said he did not mind start-up businesses. Still, he stressed that it would be a problem if private vehicles were used as unlicensed public transportation. Home-grown Gojek launched its application in Android and iOS in January and has been downloaded at least 5 million times as of Thursday. It competed directly with Malaysia-based GrabBike, which also provided service with automobiles as GrabCar. US-based Uber also found popularity among the Jakartans in the past year as its costs are cheaper than regular taxis. Online-based transportation has been serving people in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Bali and other big cities with more than 20,000 drivers.

George was a recipient of The Outstanding Young Men awards in 2020. In this interview, he shared his thoughts on differentiation and strategy as a startup. George: Currently, transportation is our biggest service. We also have logistics, which is our padala service, and concierge service, which is our pabili service, both in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu. Recently, we successfully completed pilot and we’re launching commercially the Red Cross partnership on home service for saliva RT-PCR (COVID-19 test).  In the future, health is going to be an important part of our content pipeline or service pipeline: providing home service for laboratories, blood work etc., even telemedicine. But also, in a very big way, we want to be able to really optimize or maximize deliveries and logistics for the country. George: The vision of Angkas is mobility on two wheels. We want to be able to do everything around the two-wheel ecosystem. Our stakeholders are, of course, our customers or passengers for both transport and logistics, and eventually for food.  Our other equally important stakeholders are our bikers in whom we create new entrepreneurs in two wheels. The hope is to be able to provide mobility and alternative transportation options for everybody. George: The key challenges in the Philippines right now are pandemic-related. I mean, the market is down and a lot of people are doing work from home, therefore there’s not a lot of people leaving their homes needing transport and mobility. Since majority of our services are passenger transport, this has really impacted us quite significantly. But just the same, we’re very confident that when the economy does start to go back, especially with the vaccinations happening, the need for public transportation will always be there.  The challenge right now is how to expand to various verticals that will make it efficient for the bikers to earn money throughout the day across transport, logistics and other services, such as health. George: I think that being the pioneer, we had a good head start. The brand of Angkas is very strong and we pride ourselves in safety. And we have the highest safety record, not just in the Philippines, but I believe across the region, with a 99.997 percent safety record (0.003 percent accident rate). We’re not a purely business endeavor, but also an advocacy that continues to fight for the rights of regular Filipinos to take care of his family using a motorcycle. This impacts millions of Filipinos nationwide, and I think that resonates with a lot of our customers. We’ve really built a community around it. So, if you’re using Angkas service, you somehow support our cause to generate meaningful and dignified livelihood for many low-income families. Safety has always been the most compelling aspect of our service and we’ve made sure that our standards are the highest across the board in terms of providing insurance, customer service and biker training. If we were a school, we’d be the biggest school for motorcycle safety training in the entire country. With over 150,000 bikers trained for free and passing only 30 percent, this shows that bikers of Angkas are among the best in the metro. George: Interesting enough, I may not change anything. The challenges of Angkas have also led to the strength of its brand. The way we persevered also inspired a very tight-knit community borne out of our collective struggle. So, I think that kind of feeds into both sides, the good and the bad, so to speak. Challenges created opportunities for us and without those challenges, those opportunities wouldn’t have been made available. If we weren’t so controversial, maybe we wouldn’t be as big or as relevant.  —Contributed Josiah Go is chair and chief innovation strategist of Mansmith and Fielders Inc.

But a new study on San Francisco has found the opposite may in fact be true: far from reducing traffic, the companies increased delays by 40 percent as commuters ditched buses or walking for mobile-app summoned rides.  Published Wednesday in Science Advances, the study went back to 2010, before the advent of so-called transportation network companies (TNCs), and compared journey times and road conditions with 2016, by which time they had become a common sighting.   San Francisco, where Lyft and Uber are headquartered, grew from 805,000 inhabitants to 876,000 during that period, as 150,000 jobs were added and the road network updated. The authors, from the University of Kentucky and the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA), accounted for these changes via a computer model that asked: what would things look like if ride-hailing companies had not come on the scene?  Greg Erhardt, an assistant professor of engineering at the university, told AFP his team had found “some substitution” from private cars to TNCs as well as a slight increase in carpooling. “But the net effect is that two-thirds of TNCs are new cars added to the roadway, that would otherwise not be present,” he said. They also found that weekday vehicle hours of delay — defined as the difference in travel time in congested versus free-flow conditions –- increased by 62 percent between 2010 and 2016. By contrast, in the simulated model without ride-hailing companies, delays went up by only 22 percent — meaning that the TNCs were responsible for 40 percent of the increase. Deadheading and disruption  The findings were challenged by Lyft, which said the study had failed to account for increased freight and commercial deliveries — an area in which Amazon and others have aggressively expanded in recent years, as well as tourism growth. “Lyft is actively working with cities on solutions backed by years of economic and engineering research, such as comprehensive congestion pricing and proven infrastructure investment,” the company said in a statement noting its investments in shared rides and bikes. Uber called for more widespread congestion charging, arguing that “while studies disagree on causes for congestion, almost everyone agrees on the solution.” The study came as thousands of rideshare drivers in major US cities staged a series strikes against pay and working conditions. It also came ahead of Uber’s keenly anticipated Wall Street debut. Lyft went public in March. Proponents of ridesharing often use the argument that the majority of journeys take place at non-peak times, such as when people have gone for a night out and are returning home from bars. But the study found peaks occurring at 7.00 am and 8.00 am and then again around 5.00 pm and 6.00 pm. Among the cars’ most disruptive activities on traffic flow were curbside pickups and drop-offs, especially on major arterial roads, it found. Another notable effect was so-called “deadheading,” which Erhardt explained as driving around in search of the next customer. “It doesn’t serve a purpose in terms of transporting a person. So that’s purely an addition to traffic.” Data scraping The study relied on background traffic speed from GPS data obtained from a commercial vendor, but when the researchers approached the companies to share their own trip data, they were denied access.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); They were forced then to rely on a method of data scraping developed by Northeastern University that uses the companies’ public apps to learn about vehicle movements. Elliot Martin, a research engineer at the University of California Berkeley’s Transportation Sustainability Research Center, who was not connected to the study, said its methodology was rigorous. “I think that they did a good job of trying to draw comparisons, to look at what would have happened in a world where TNCs didn’t exist versus where they did exist,” he said, adding the methodology was the “best available” given the amount of information. Despite the findings, ride-hailing isn’t all bad, said co-author Joe Castiglione of the SFCTA. “They are providing services like helping people move around in the evening when transit isn’t great, or assisting the visually impaired,” he told AFP. The trick, he said, was to determine “how (to) manage the positive benefits without the negative externalities” through new policies like congestion pricing or curbside regulation. Stephen Goldsmith, director of Data-Smart city solutions at Harvard, and the former mayor of Indianapolis, agreed. “There’s no love lost today between most cities and Uber, but there’s a lot of customer loyalty, which makes it difficult for cities to cut back too much.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1061261/davao-court-issues-warrant-of-arrest-vs-trillanes","title":"Davao court issues warrant of arrest vs Trillanes","date":"07:16 AM December 08, 2018","snippet":"DAVAO CITY—The Regional Trial Court (RTC) here has issued an arrest warrant against Sen.

Defamation, libel In his second case against Trillanes, Paolo said the senator “defamed and labeled” the Dutertes, by calling them the “principal actors” in the drug trade in Davao City.  “Evidently, it was intended to malign, destroy and kill my good name and reputation, locally, nationally and internationally.

In her order, Dayanghirang said Trillanes could gain temporary liberty by posting a P24,000 bail bond. “The head office to whom this warrant of arrest has been delivered for execution shall cause the warrant to be executed within 10 days upon receipt,” Dayanghirang’s order said. But Trillanes on Friday refused to turn himself in, invoking his constitutional privilege from arrest as a lawmaker facing an offense punishable by less than six years in prison with Congress still in session. He also cited a Department of Justice regulation prohibiting the serving of arrest warrants for libel and other minor cases on Fridays, weekends and holidays.  Paolo, who is running for the  Davao City seat in the House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections, earlier said he was not seeking vengeance against Trillanes but merely wanted justice. Respondent’s rights Trillanes said he was ready to face charges but wished to defend his rights as a respondent. “So, instead of turning myself in, which is apparently not possible under the circumstances, I will just post bail before the appropriate court on Monday,” he said in a statement. “Regardless, I will face this. I was planning to coordinate with [National Capital Region Police Office] chief Director [Guillermo] Eleazar once the warrant is available, so that I could turn myself in voluntarily,” he said. He denounced the President for the issuance of the arrest warrant. “Justice is reversed in the government of Duterte. Thieves have been freed. Cases are invented against critics to forcefully detain them,” he said. —REPORTS FROM  GERMELINA LACORTE AND DJ YAP"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/75031/ltfrb-accredits-filipino-owned-ride-hailing-firm-hype","title":"LTFRB accredits Filipino-owned ride-hailing firm, Hype","date":"12:14 PM April 19, 2018","snippet":"Three days after Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited on Wednesday a Filipino-owned transport network company (TNC) that would rival the operations of Grab at a time when passenger complaints against it continue to mount.","body":"Three days after Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited on Wednesday a Filipino-owned transport network company (TNC) that would rival the operations of Grab at a time when passenger complaints against it continue to mount. The LTFRB accredited Hype, giving app-based drivers as well as commuters an alternative to Grab, and eliminating Grab’s “virtual monopoly” of the industry that apparently followed after its acquisition of its rival Uber last month.  LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III noted, however, that it would be up to Hype and other TNCs they would later accredit how they would market themselves to lure drivers and commuters to their platforms. Currently, the LTFRB implements a common supply base for app-based drivers. Unlike before, a driver can now drive for any of the existing accredited TNCs since the provisional authority or franchise to operate given to them is generic and does not bare the name of any of the TNCs.  Bu LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said drivers would still need to obtain accreditation from their chosen TNC for accountability purposes. To date, four more TNCs are awaiting to accrediation from the LTFRB, namely: Hirna, Go Lag, Micab, and Owto.  Delgra said they hope to accredit the other applicants once they have complied with the LTFRB’s requirements. For one, he said, these TNCs must show proof that they are able to accept responsibility and respond to passenger complaints. Hype’s entry to the ride-hailing industry comes amid mounting complaints against Grab for its high fare and picky drivers. Brian Cu, Grab’s country head, has nevertheless assured the public that apart from passenger complaints mechanisms, they have in place in their system the ability to detect and determine if a driver is deliberately forcing a rider to cancel a requested trip. Cu said that once they verified that a driver forced a passenger to cancel a booking, the erring driver would be summoned to their office for investigation and may be suspended or removed from their platform. /kga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/283629/grab-to-obey-pcc-order-for-p5-m-refund-to-customers","title":"Grab to obey PCC order for P5-M refund to customers","date":"03:55 PM November 18, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing company Grab Philippines will comply with the order of the Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) for a P5-million refund to its riders.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing company Grab Philippines will comply with the order of the Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) for a P5-million refund to its riders.

According to LTFRB chair Martin Delgra, the transport board continues to receive “mounting complaints” not only on overcharging, but also on the insufficient number of drivers on the road to cater to the swell of passengers during the holiday season.  He noted in a statement that the LTFRB had issued around 49,000 provisional authorities and 11,000 certificates of public conveniences (CPCs) to transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers, all under nine competing ride-hailing platforms, including Grab. In theory, this meant that there should be 60,000 drivers on the road to accommodate the riding public. The current cap for TNVS drivers is at 65,000.  Grab, which according to the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has cornered 99 percent of the country’s ride-hailing market, currently has 36,000 drivers on its platform. But while the TNC  assured the public that these drivers were all active, the number was staggeringly disproportional to the 700,000 to 800,000 bookings made daily. “The question here is why are there only a few units on the road?” Delgra asked. “The TNCs have to clarify this to us and to the riding public.”  “Do not abuse the clamor for TNVS this holiday season because we will not hesitate to revoke your franchise should you continue to violate its terms,” he added. Delgra also reminded the TNCs that they must follow the fare structure guidelines set by the LTFRB, warning that the board was continuously reviewing and monitoring their fare setting computation to determine any violation. Grab was penalized earlier by the PCC for supposedly charging beyond the acceptable fare range. Under the LTFRB’s Joint Administrative Order 2014-1, overcharging is equivalent to a fine of P5,000 per passenger."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1330126/grab-extends-service-hours-in-ncr-cebu-pampanga","title":"Grab extends service hours in NCR, Cebu, Pampanga","date":"11:50 AM September 02, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Starting Wednesday, ride-hailing app Grab will be extending its service hours in Metro Manila, Cebu and Pampanga.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Starting Wednesday, ride-hailing app Grab will be extending its service hours in Metro Manila, Cebu and Pampanga.

According to the DOTr, “the best recourse [to convert] motorcycle taxis [into] public transport” is for Congress to amend Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code.  In a statement on Sunday, the DOTr also urged the public to wait for the report of the technical working group (TWG) it had created to study the feasibility of motorcycle taxis. In a Jan. 31 Senate hearing, Senators Ralph Recto and Grace Poe again suggested that the DOTr issue a department order regulating motorcycles for hire pending the passage of a law amending RA 4136.  When Uber — a ride-hailing app that offers rides in private cars — came to the Philippines in 2015, the then-Department of Transportation and Communication issued Department Order 2015-11 to categorize transport network vehicle services (TNVS) — or private cars — as a form of public transport. Recto said that issuing a similar order covering motorcycle ride-hailing apps like Angkas would allow the DOTr to regulate such services while waiting for Congress to amend RA 4136.  Not for hire However, the DOTr pointed out that RA 4136 specifically classified motorcycles as vehicles that were “not for hire.” “According to Republic Act 4136, passenger automobiles may be classified as either private or public (for hire), depending on its purpose. Thus, although TNVS units were initially classified as private vehicles, their transition to public transport only required a conversion to another classification,” it said. A department order, it added, would also violate the temporary restraining order issued by the Supreme Court in December that in effect halted Angkas’ operations. “The DOTr wishes to reiterate that it does not intend to antagonize Angkas. In fact, [it] has welcomed motorcycle groups in TWG discussions to thresh out the requirements and other contingent issues.

It makes New York the first major US city to limit the number of app-based rides and to impose pay rules, with authorities under pressure to act over pollution and worsening congestion.  The financial capital of 8.5 million is the biggest app-ride market in the United States, where public transport woes and astronomical parking costs have helped fuel years of untamed growth by the likes of Lyft and Uber. But that growth has brought New York’s iconic yellow cabs to their knees and since December, six yellow-cab drivers have committed suicide.  Those deaths have been linked to desperation over plummeting income. The increased competition has slashed the value of yellow cab taxi licenses from more than $1 million in 2014 to less than $200,000 today. The bill stipulates a 12-month cap on all new for-hire-vehicle licenses, unless they are wheelchair accessible, as well as minimum pay requirements for app drivers – regulated by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).  The TLC, which regulates taxis and is a powerful force in New York politics, commissioned a study recently in a bid to underscore the chaos and push city authorities into taking action. That report recommended a guaranteed income of $17.22 an hour for drivers – the city’s $15 minimum wage is due to come into effect at the end of 2018 – plus a supplement to mitigate against rest time. Uber hit back Wednesday, saying the 12-month pause would threaten one of the city’s “few reliable transportation options” – a swipe at a burgeoning subway crisis – “while doing nothing to fix the subways or ease congestion.” “Uber will do whatever it takes to keep up with growing demand and we will not stop working with city and state leaders… to pass real solutions like comprehensive congestion pricing,” a spokesperson said. ‘Workers prevailed’  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a progressive Democrat, vowed to sign the bill into law, claiming that it would “stop the influx of cars contributing to the congestion grinding our streets to a halt.” “More than 100,000 workers and their families will see an immediate benefit from this legislation,” De Blasio said. It comes after the city was forced to shelve plans in 2015 to cap the number of vehicles operated by Uber, after the multibillion-dollar corporation fought tooth and nail against the legislation in a slick ad campaign. The Independent Drivers Guild, which represents more than 65,000 app-based drivers such as those from Lyft and Uber, on Wednesday celebrated. “Workers and New York leaders made history today. It’s not easy taking on Silicon Valley behemoths, but we kept on fighting for what we know is right and today the workers prevailed,” said executive director Ryan Price. Most drivers in New York work full time and are often immigrants without higher education. They get into heavy debt to buy their vehicle license and have little other means of generating income. Around 85 percent earn substantially less than the equivalent of a $15-an-hour minimum wage, according to the TLC-commissioned study. Around 80,000 drivers work for at least one of the big four app-based companies in New York, compared to 13,500 yellow cab drivers, it found. Last year, London’s transport authority stripped Uber of its license over safety concerns, but the corporation appealed the decision and was allowed to continue operating while the case was heard. In June, a British judge overturned the earlier decision and granted the ride-hailing app a 15-month permit.   /kga"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1019383/new-york-moves-to-cap-uber-app-ride-vehicles","title":"New York moves to cap Uber, app-ride vehicles","date":"07:52 AM August 09, 2018","snippet":"NEW YORK – New York’s city council on Wednesday dealt a blow to Uber and other car-for-hire companies, passing a bill to cap the number of vehicles they operate and impose minimum pay standards on drivers.","body":"NEW YORK – New York’s city council on Wednesday dealt a blow to Uber and other car-for-hire companies, passing a bill to cap the number of vehicles they operate and impose minimum pay standards on drivers.

The world’s leading ride-hailing service set the stage for its long-awaited arrival on the stock market by pricing its initial public offering at $45 per share late Thursday.  The price is at the lower end of its targeted range of $44 to $50 per share, a decision that may have been driven by the escalating doubts about the ability of ride-hailing service’s ability to make money since Uber’s main rival, Lyft, went public six weeks ago. Even at the tamped-down price, Uber now has a market value of $82.4 billion – significantly more than century-old automakers General Motors and Ford Motor.  Uber will face its next test Friday when its shares begin trading the New York Stock Exchange. No matter how the stock swings, the IPO has to be considered a triumph for the company most closely associated with a ride-hailing industry that has changed the way millions of people get around while also transforming the way millions of more people earn a living in the gig economy.  The IPO raised another $8.1 billion for Uber as it tries to fend off rival Lyft in the U.S. and help cover the cost of giving rides to passengers at unprofitable prices. The San Francisco company already has lost about $9 billion since its inception and acknowledges it could still be years before it turns a profit. That sobering reality is one reason that Uber fell well short of reaching the $120 billion market value that many observers believed its IPO might attain earlier this year. Another factor working against Uber is the cold shoulder that investors have been giving Lyft’s stock after an initial run-up. Lyft’s shares closed Thursday 23% below its IPO price of $72 in April. The jitters about an intensifying U.S. trade war with China also have roiled the stock market this week. Despite all that, Uber’s IPO is the biggest since Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group debuted with a value of $167.6 billion in 2014. “For the market to give you the value, you’ve either got to have a lot of profits or potential for huge growth,” said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research.  And Uber boasts growth galore. Its revenue last year surged 42% to $11.3 billion while its cars completed 5.2 billion trips around the world either giving rides to 91 million passengers or delivering food. Uber might be even more popular if not for a series of revelations about unsavory behavior that sullied its image and resulted in the ouster of its co-founder, Travis Kalanick, as CEO nearly two years ago. The self-inflicted wounds included complaints about rampant internal sexual harassment, accusations that it stole self-driving car technology, and a cover-up of a computer break-in that stole personal information about its passengers. What’s more, some Uber drivers have been accused of assaulting passengers, and one of its self-driving test vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona last year while a backup driver was behind the wheel. Uber hired Dara Khosrowshahi as CEO to replace Kalanick and clean up the mess, something that analysts said has been able to do to some extent, although Lyft seized upon the scandals to gain market share. Kalanick remains on Uber’s board, although he isn’t expected to be on the podium to help ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange to herald the company’s debut Friday. Instead, he is expected to be on the trading floor, perhaps savoring his newfound wealth. At $45 per share, Kalanick’s stake in Uber will be worth $5.3 billion. Hundreds, if not thousands, of other Uber employees are expected to become millionaires in the IPO. Meanwhile, scores of Uber drivers say they have been mistreated by the company as they work long hours and wear out their cars picking up passengers as they struggle to make ends meet. On Wednesday, some of them participated in strikes across the United States to highlight their unhappiness ahead of Uber’s IPO but barely caused a ripple. A similar strike was organized ahead of Lyft’s IPO to the same effect. Uber may be able to avoid Lyft’s post-IPO stock decline because it has a different story to tell other than the potential for growth in ride-hailing, says Alejandro Ortiz, principal analyst with SharesPost. Uber, he said, has plans to be more than a ride-hailing company by being all things transportation to users of its app, offering deliveries, scooters, bicycles and links to other modes of transportation including public mass transit systems. “Whether or not that pitch will work kind of remains to be seen. It’s nearly impossible to tell now,” he said. “Obviously the risk to the company now is they have a lot more shareholders that they have to convince.” /kga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/214568/citi-grab-roll-out-cashless-transport-solution","title":"Citi, Grab team up on cashless payment","date":"11:42 AM September 06, 2016","snippet":"GLOBAL banking giant Citi and Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing platform Grab have teamed up to promote cashless payments, enticing credit card holders with discounts and freebies and allowing commuters to use their credit card points as currency.","body":"GLOBAL banking giant Citi and Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing platform Grab have teamed up to promote cashless payments, enticing credit card holders with discounts and freebies and allowing commuters to use their credit card points as currency. The partnership – a first for Asia – will be rolled out in five markets in Asia-Pacific, beginning in the Philippines and Singapore, with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to follow shortly.  “By grounding our reputation in safety, quality and availability, Grab is now the trusted, ride-hailing leader in our six markets with one in eight smartphone users in Southeast Asia already on our platform. As customers use Grab for their regular transport needs, many of them are choosing to go cashless by adopting GrabPay for a more seamless ride experience. We are thrilled to partner with Citi to extend its best-in-class loyalty capabilities to make it easier to serve and reward our customers in the region,” Joel Yarbrough, head of payments and commerce product at Grab, said in a joint press statement with Citi. “Our strategy in consumer banking is to be the world’s leading digital bank which includes delivering a remarkable client experience in key digital ecosystems. We have seen that the rapid adoption of mobile and other digital channels has truly transformed how and where people bank and we are delighted to partner with Grab. By integrating our services into key applications such as Grab we also will drive growth in our cards business via new acquisitions and increased customer loyalty,” said Anand Selva, head of Citi’s Asia Pacific consumer banking.  As part of the initial phase, customers who added their Citi credit card to GrabPay, Grab’s mobile payment platform, would receive a discounted first ride. The partnership is also seen as away for Citi to attract cardholders among Grab users. Grab customers who sign up for any Citi credit card through the partnership gets a number of free rides worth up to $50.  The next phase will allow customers to pay for Grab rides using points. Citibank credit cardholders who charge their Citi credit card on GrabPay will receive a SMS from Citi requesting if they would like to redeem the ride for points. Upon replying with their acceptance, the redemption will be made automatically and reflected in the customer’s monthly statement. This innovative pay for rides service is the first in the region enabling credit card holders to easily exchange their points for on-demand redemption for smaller, daily transactions — in one step. For Citi cardholders, the points earned depends on the type of card. Generally, a cardholder earns one point for every P30 of spending. Citi and Grab will announce soon how points will be converted to Grab peso bill. Grab currently operates in 30 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam – markets and cities through which Citi offers consumer banking services including credit cards. Grab seeks to solve critical transportation challenges for 620 million people in Southeast Asia.

The launch follows Singapore-based GrabTaxi’s debut, which began a trial run in the Southeast Asian country about six weeks ago.  Uber is one of the world’s largest on-demand transportation platforms. It is seeking an alliance with the government to smooth acceptance of the use of private vehicles for commercial transport. A taxi ride in Myanmar usually involves negotiating prices, no use of meters and a lack of air conditioning or seat belts. Using a ride-hailing app is still a relatively new concept, though the practice has been gaining in popularity.  Local travel services start-up Oway and Hello Cabs, a rival service run by a construction and auto dealership tycoon, also provide ride-hailing services. “I definitely want to try Uber,” said Nyan Zay Htet, a company worker who was haggling with a driver over a fare on a downtown street in Yangon. “I welcome having international companies come in because it can be more convenient for us if we don’t have to bargain over prices and can just hop in and go.”  Some taxi drivers, however, expressed alarm about other companies edging onto their turf. “My car is my livelihood,” said Tun Mya, who said he was already earning less because people were hailing fewer traditional taxis. “I am a bit worried … I don’t know what will happen yet, but we are watching,” he said. More than two-thirds of Southeast Asians are younger than 40 and the number going online to buy goods and services is soaring. A recent research report by Google and the Singaporean investment arm Temasek put the potential ride-sharing market in six larger regional markets at $13 billion by 2025, up from $2.5 billion in 2015. With more than 50 million people, Myanmar is growing fast and its public transport networks are not keeping up. Taxis are plentiful in Yangon, with local media reporting authorities estimate there are more than 50,000 on the city’s jammed roads. The industry is something of a free-for-all, with non-licensed drivers turning their cars into taxis as they please. But the government has said it intends to crack down on that. Incomes for most people are still low, so price competition may be key.  An online Uber fare estimator put the base fare in Yangon at 1,500 kyats (pronounced chuts) ($1.09) with a minimum charge of 1,800 kyats ($1.31). Uber has faced trouble from regulators in various markets, including China, France, Spain and Mexico. But generally they target services transporting paying customers using private vehicles that are not registered for public transport, not ride-hailing that uses smartphone apps to call licensed taxis. Phyo Min Thein, chief minister of Yangon Region, said the government was welcoming Uber and other ride-hailing companies into the market to improve transportation in the city."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/233826/grab-secure-historic-2-5-b-investment","title":"Grab out to secure historic $2.5-B investment","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"PETALING JAYA, Malaysia—Grab, a Malaysian start-up that has amassed a dominant market share of the ride-hailing market in South-East Asia, is expanding into financial services with the latest round of fundings.","body":"PETALING JAYA, Malaysia—Grab, a Malaysian start-up that has amassed a dominant market share of the ride-hailing market in South-East Asia, is expanding into financial services with the latest round of fundings. The company is out to secure US$2.5billion in what will be the largest single financing in the history of South-East Asia for a start-up.  China’s largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, both existing investors in Grab, will fork out US$2bil to lead the current round of funding. “We are already a clear leader in online transportation in South-East Asia with a 71% overall market share. We want to grow that further,” said Grab group chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder Anthony Tan to StarBiz.  SoftBank is Japan’s biggest Internet company that has a tech fund of over US$100bil that it has invested in other ride-hailing companies, including Didi and Brazil’s ride-hailing app provider, 99. “We have a long-time partnership with Didi, as we share the same commitment and leverage on each other’s technologies,” said Anthony.  “With the support of investors, Grab will achieve an unassailable market lead in ridesharing, and build on this to make GrabPay the payment solution of choice for South-East Asia,” said Anthony. He added that Grab was still looking for new and existing investors for the remaining US$500mil portion. The new round of funding is expected to be used to grow its payments platform, GrabPay, given the rise in demand for mobile payment methods and Grab having its own GrabPay function. Many are betting that Grab will transform GrabPay into a consumer technology firm that would be able to offer loans, electronic money transfer and money-market funds. Grab bought Indonesian payment service Kudo earlier this year. “We are always on the lookout for strategic investment opportunities in regional companies which have great technology and who share our vision to move South-East Asia forward. We want to invest in developing and expanding GrabPay to become the mobile platform of choice for South-East Asia,” he said.  Grab needs the funding to strengthen itself in South-East Asia to capitalize on the rising demand for ride-hailing services and also mobile payments. This comes on the back of competition from the world’s largest ride-hailing app provider, Uber Technologies. After facing a flurry of issues in global markets including Russia, China and the United States, Uber has turned its focus to South-East Asia and India. Uber recently began advertising its services in a bid to win confidence and also market share. Grab is now headquartered in Singapore. Anthony is group CEO of Grab and co-founder, and his partner is Tan Hooi Ling. Both were studying in Harvard when they decided to start Grab some five years ago. Anthony’s grandfather, Tan Sri Tan Yuet Foh, and his grand uncle Tan Sri Tan Kim Hor co-founded the Tan Chong group. His father, Datuk Tan Heng Chew, is the president of Tan Chong Consolidated. Grab operates private car, motorcycle, taxi and carpooling services across seven countries in the region, with 1.1 million drivers. It recently entered the Myanmar market and has operations in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. With this latest rounding of funding, it is said that Grab could be valued at about US$6bil. Grab has raised US$1.5bil since it started. Its previous investors include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, hedge fund Coatue Management LLC, venture capital firm GGV Capital and Vertex Venture Holdings – a subsidiary of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd. It has six technology hubs, one each in Seattle, Beijing, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangalore and Indonesia. Apart from Uber, Grab faces challenges from local taxis in most of its markets, and both in Indonesia and Thailand, it is also up against Go-Jek, the motorbike taxi on demand. China’s Tencent Holdings Lte is said to have invested over US$100mil in Go-Jek."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/123415/disservice-to-commuters","title":"Disservice to commuters","date":"05:08 AM August 19, 2019","snippet":"Developments last week have been favorable to the commuting public, which has long been suffering from a near monopoly in the ride-hailing sector.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) started by pointing out that a year after Uber left, ride-hailing has remained uncompetitive, referring to Grab as the very dominant player in this service. A virtual monopoly leaves the riding public with no alternative. Competition, on the other hand, forces players to improve efficiency and lower prices. The near-monopoly position of Grab explains the numerous complaints on fare surges even beyond rush hours, canceled bookings and other aggravations that riders have to endure since no alternative service exists.  At about the same time as the PCC announcement, the Anti-Red Tape Authority (Arta) called out the the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for sitting on the applications of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers. The next day, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade directed the LTFRB to approve all complete but pending applications of these ride-hailing drivers. The Department of Transportation ordered the LTFRB to immediately release certificates of public convenience (CPCs) to qualified ride-hailing driver-applicants. Tugade also directed Transportation Undersecretary for Roads Mark de Leon and the LTFRB to comply immediately with Arta’s directive to automatically approve all pending TNVS applications and issue them the corresponding CPCs.  Arta’s action followed complaints from TNVS drivers alleging irregularities in the processing of their TNVS applications by the LTFRB. According to the complaints, their applications already had the complete requirements, but they could not operate as drivers and operators while waiting for the issuance of the CPCs. Aside from these developments, the PCC announced that it would also renegotiate the conditions that Grab had previously agreed to when it sought the PCC’s approval of the Grab-Uber deal, which resulted in the departure of Uber from Southeast Asia.  Those conditions, called voluntary commitments, took effect in August 2018 with the hope that they would improve market conditions, particularly the maintenance of reasonable fares that existed when Uber was still around. But those hoped-for improvements have not materialized. Exactly a year after PCC’s decision on Grab’s acquisition of rival Uber on Aug. 10, 2018, the competition authority lamented that the dominance of Grab (the surviving firm in the agreement with Uber) remains unchallenged, and competition has not improved in the ride-hailing market. It said the market continues to be uncompetitive despite the entry of a number of smaller transport network companies, which had big shoes to fill when Uber exited the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia. The PCC gave only a hint of what the new commitments would be, saying they would include adjusted metrics to hold Grab in check for its fare surges, instances of driver discrimination through booking cancellations and service quality. The commitments should be designed to prevent Grab from exercising its market power as a virtual monopolist, according to PCC Chair Arsenio M.Balisacan. They may also include measures that will allow smaller players to grow, or for formidable new competitors to enter the market for the benefit of the riding public. Last year, PCC officials warned that Grab’s failure to comply with the commitments would be met with a fine of P2 million per breach, or even the “unwinding of the transaction.” It’s really a puzzle why the LTFRB appears to be acting in a way that commuters feel is against their interest, with the regulatory agency throwing up all possible roadblocks to the approval of more ride-hailing companies that can compete with Grab, or more driver-applicants to increase supply and bring rates down. It’s a good thing the PCC and Arta are keeping an eye on such government agencies that, by their continuing failure to protect commuters and do their job with dispatch, openness and efficiency, are a huge disservice to the public."},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/25736/lyft-ipo-sets-rollout-for-ride-hailing-sharing-economy","title":"Lyft IPO Sets Rollout for Ride-Hailing, Sharing Economy","date":"04:34 AM March 30, 2019","snippet":"The San Francisco-based firm was expected to begin trading as soon as Friday after it boosted the range of its offering price to between $70 and $72 per share.","body":"The San Francisco-based firm was expected to begin trading as soon as Friday after it boosted the range of its offering price to between $70 and $72 per share. Lyft will have a valuation of at least $20 billion with the initial public offering (IPO), one of the first from a wave of venture backed “unicorns,” or startups worth more $1 billion or more.   Its entry to the public markets comes ahead of a hotly anticipated offering from larger rideshare rival Uber, which is valued at some $70 billion, and other tech startups including the business collaboration firm Slack and visual discovery engine Pinterest. Both Lyft and Uber are promoting their moves as lifestyle-changing, which could wean dependence on private cars and help reshape urban landscapes. “Ridesharing has transformed our lives, making it easier and cheaper to get where we need to go, and it’s pioneering an undeniable trend toward transportation as a service,” said a research note this week from Gene Munster and Will Thompson of the investment firm Loup Ventures. These firms, which are stepping up moves to autonomous rides, have been expanding aggressively — with Lyft gaining market share in the United States and Uber in dozens of international markets. They have also sought to become broader transportation platforms that connect consumers to e-scooters, electric bikes and local transit systems. Uber and Lyft are among the most prominent firms in the  sharing economy, which also includes home-sharing platform Airbnb and highlight a trend away from ownership to services. Lyft says it aims to play a growing role in the $1 trillion US transport sector. But analysts point out that competition is growing and that any investment may be risky. Lyft lost $911 million on $2.2 billion in 2018 revenues. The documents show revenues grew sharply from $343 million in 2016, but losses widened as well. Analyst Richard Windsor, who writes the tech blog Radio Free Mobile, argues that Lyft may not be ready for the scrutiny it will face as a publicly traded firm.   “Lyft is shooting itself in the foot by going public, as I continue to think that the company is not ready for the harsh glare of the public market and it is giving away a big edge that it could have had over Uber,” Windsor writes. “A big hit the share price can cause a loss of confidence in the product triggering a vicious death spiral. This ties the hands of the management in terms of the actions it can take and will make it harder to be nimble, flexible and to compete against Uber.” Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said Lyft may benefit from the missteps of Uber, but that it may face a rocky road with the emergence of Waymo, the former Google car unit which is launch its autonomous taxi service. “Lyft is an attractive name to own to play this transformative ridesharing market opportunity,” Ives said in a note to clients, while adding that “we find it hard to be bullish on the name given the risk/reward we see for shares.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/269418/uber-looks-to-raise-up-to-9b-in-initial-public-offering","title":"Uber looks to raise up to $9B in initial public offering","date":"06:34 PM April 28, 2019","snippet":"NEW YORK — Ride-hailing giant Uber is aiming to raise $9 billion in its mammoth initial public stock offering that, while smaller than initially expected, still dwarfs most stock market debuts.","body":"NEW YORK — Ride-hailing giant Uber is aiming to raise $9 billion in its mammoth initial public stock offering that, while smaller than initially expected, still dwarfs most stock market debuts. The San Francisco-based company expects to be valued at $80.5 billion to $91.5 billion, falling well below prior estimates that rose as high as $120 billion, in a sign that investors may be taking a more cautious approach to ride-hailing after the stock performance of Uber’s rival, Lyft.  Even so, Uber is on track for one of the largest IPOs in history. The company plans to sell 180 million shares for between $44 and $50 each. Lyft went public last month and its stock price fell 21% from its initial offering price of $72, and was selling for about $57 on Friday.  “With Lyft’s IPO being down more than 20% in a market that’s hitting new highs every day, that’s a dynamic that probably has been factored in as well,” said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. Uber is part of a wave of technology companies that are going public, and Pinterest and Zoom both saw their stock prices climb substantially after their IPOs this month. Slack and Postmates are also waiting for their turn.  Over the coming weeks Uber is likely to revise those figures as it launches its so-called road show, where it pitches the company and gets feedback from potential investors. It is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange next month. Uber also disclosed that PayPal plans to buy $500 million in stock at the IPO price, and that the companies will explore future commercial payment collaborations, including the development of Uber’s digital wallet. Uber gave potential investors a first look at its finances this month, revealing nearly $8 billion in losses over a decade. That mirrors the challenges faced by Lyft. But Uber also showed impressive growth. Its revenue totaled $11.3 billion in 2018, which was a 42% increase from $7.9 billion in 2017, and far above its $495 million in revenue in 2014. That rapid growth has continued this year. On a preliminary basis, revenue rose to a range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion during the three months that ended March 31, compared with $2.6 billion a year ago.  However, the company estimated losses of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the first quarter. Uber chalks them up to operational expenses as the company continues to invest in its core platform, including spending on incentives and promotions. In the first quarter of 2018, Uber posted a one-time profit of $3.7 billion, helped by the sale of its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia, which brought in $3.2 billion, and an unrealized $2 billion gain from Uber’s investment in Didi, the transportation network company in China. Both Uber and Lyft face an uncertain path to profitability as they deal with intense competition, high costs to pay drivers, increased regulation by cites and a long, uncertain road to the development of autonomous vehicles.“We know that companies with large losses tend to be problematic for IPO investors,” said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research and IPO exchange traded funds. “There is no doubt that Lyft is a factor in Uber’s valuation.” While Lyft is primarily a domestic ride-sharing business, Uber is building a ride-sharing platform that it can also use to monetize its freight and food delivery businesses, Ives said. “Lyft doesn’t have that,” Ives said. “It’s more of a one-trick pony right now.” Uber also lost market share after a series of embarrassing revelations and has been working to repair its reputation. It disclosed earlier this month that it faces a criminal investigation from the U.S. Justice Department into a cover-up of a massive computer break-in during 2016 that took personal information of millions of passengers and drivers, among other legal challenges. Uber stockholders also will be selling 27 million shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase stock."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248555/grab-uber-deal-still-hangs","title":"Grab-Uber deal still hangs","date":"05:30 AM April 04, 2018","snippet":"The competition watchdog has decided to review Grab’s takeover of its main rival here in the country, but it remains unclear if it could still prevent Uber from stopping operations next week.","body":"The competition watchdog has decided to review Grab’s takeover of its main rival here in the country, but it remains unclear if it could still prevent Uber from stopping operations next week. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said on Tuesday that it would review the Grab-Uber deal, hoping to buy more time by convincing the popular ride-hailing firms to delay their transaction.  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the biggest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. Uber is already scheduled to stop operations on April 8. PCC would be reviewing the deal even after the parties involved said that the transaction was not notifiable under current PCC rules. Technically, Uber and Grab are already allowed to push through with their deal.  However, the law also allows PCC to review a non-notifiable deal if the antitrust body finds a “reasonable basis” to do so, according to Competition Chair Arsenio Balisacan. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet certain requirements deemed to be potentially anticompetitive in the market. Such deal is not allowed to be acted upon until PCC finishes its review of the notifiable M&A.  Depending on how the companies would cooperate, the review, which would see if the acquisition is anticompetition, could take months. The first phase of the review takes at most 75 days, Balisacan said. However, if there would be “serious gaps in our analysis because of a lack of information,” the review could extend for another 120 days at most, he added. What would happen in the meantime is uncertain. PCC officials would meet with Grab and Uber officials on Thursday to discuss interim measures that both PCC and the companies would have to agree on. “The interim measure is intended so that the review would not be compromised. [Essentially, it means] that the situation that was prevailing before the consummation of the transaction would continue to prevail,” Balisacan said.  It is still unclear if the upcoming Grab monopoly would agree to PCC’s terms. “The Grab-Uber acquisition is likely to have a far-reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services. As such, the PCC is looking at the deal closely,” the PCC earlier said in a statement. It said the deal would put Grab in a virtual monopoly in the ride-hailing market and its review would determine whether the transaction would substantially reduce competition. The Philippines joins Malaysia, which said on Monday it would look into whether Uber’s move to sell its Southeast Asian business to Grab hindered competition. Earlier, Singapore also began a probe into the deal on similar concerns. Singapore had already proposed interim measures to require Uber and Grab to maintain their pretransaction independent pricing until the government has completed a review of the deal, arguing that it had “reasonable grounds” to suspect that competition had been infringed by the acquisition. Singapore-based Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-sharing company, snapped up main rival Uber’s business in the region, promising better services through its enlarged network. Grab said it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/259072/report-uber-ipo-put-company-value-120-b","title":"Report: Uber IPO could put company value at $120 B","date":"09:47 PM October 16, 2018","snippet":"NEW YORK — Uber may put forth an initial public offering early next year that values the ride-hailing business at as much as $120 billion, according to a media report.","body":"NEW YORK — Uber may put forth an initial public offering early next year that values the ride-hailing business at as much as $120 billion, according to a media report.

Shares in Uber tumbled 10.75 percent to close at $37.10 on the second day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  Valued at some $82 billion in one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) in the technology sector, Uber’s debut Friday was a major disappointment, losing 7.6 percent. The two-day meltdown left the Silicon Valley star with a cumulative loss of more 17.5 percent while ride-hailing rival Lyft has plunged 33 percent since its March debut.  Jay Ritter, a University of Florida professor of finance specializing in IPOs, said it was highly unusual for a high-profile company like Uber to fall so quickly.   “But it’s a very difficult company to value, and I expect that there will be big upswings and downswings in the future,” Ritter said. Still, Ritter said the rocky opening is not necessarily an indication of the long-term value of Uber. “If a year from now its value goes up to $100 billion people will be no longer talking about the first two days of trading,” he said. ‘Remember Facebook’ Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi urged employees to look past the rough patch on Wall Street and stay focused on better days ahead, according to an internal email obtained by AFP.  “Remember that the Facebook and Amazon post-IPO trading was incredibly difficult for those companies,” Khosrowshahi said in the message. “And look at how they have delivered since. Our road will be the same.” He noted that Monday was a tough day for the stock market overall, not just for the San Francisco-based ride-share company with visions of becoming the “Amazon of transportation.” Khosrowshahi acknowledged that there were versions of Uber’s future in which the company does not prosper as hoped, but warned against being distracted by pessimistic voices in the market. “Sentiment does not change overnight, and I expect some tough public market times over the coming months,” he said in the email. “We will be judged long-term on our performance, and I welcome that.” Troubled road ahead Richard Windsor, an analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog on technology, said Uber and Lyft have been pressured by their high valuations and intense competition. Uber and Lyft “are currently engaged in a life or death struggle to become the dominant ridesharing platform in the USA,” Windsor said. “Until this fight is settled, there is very little reason to invest in either company as while they slug it out rock bottom prices and incentives for drivers will continue to plague profitability.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Lyft shares Monday fell nearly six percent to $48.15, extending the steady decline for Uber’s smaller US rival. Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said he expected the “valuation digestion process” to take some time and that he remained upbeat on Uber despite competition with Lyft and the long path to profitability. “We believe there is a large enough ocean for two boats as the ridesharing market domestically in the US is roughly $1.2 trillion and $5.7 trillion globally,” Ives said. “We expect ridership, drivers, and the monetization opportunities for Uber to increase markedly over the coming years. A core tenet of our bull thesis on Uber is around the company’s ability to morph its unrivaled ridesharing platform into a broader consumer engine.” Uber and Lyft face additional troubles, highlighted by last week’s protests from some drivers in the US, and regulatory roadblocks in many parts of the world. Thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers turned off their apps in a US-wide strike last week over revenue-sharing formulas and working conditions. Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/290087/colorum-motorcycle-taxi-app-operating-in-cebu","title":"‘Colorum’ motorcycle taxi app operating in Cebu","date":"February 24,2020 - 02:50 PM","snippet":"","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines — Another motorcycle ride hailing has started to operate in Cebu without clearance from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board in Central Visayas (LTFRB-7).

I said I’d vote for Leni Robredo. He agreed, but with a long, slow drawl that sounded uneasy.  “I want to vote for her,” he said in Filipino, “But she’s a woman.” My brain kicked into research mode. “Why do you say, ‘But she’s a woman’?” I asked.  “A woman is soft.” “Why is that wrong?”  “Because the president of a country has to be strong and noble, right?” “Why do you think this is important?” “Because I’m a man!” “So: are you voting for yourself or for the country?” A beat. Silence. Then, “Oh, ma’am, did you see what the Department of Health did last week?”  Our conversation turned to other things (we talked the entire ride), and he never brought up the idea of “women can’t be leaders” again. His view is neither isolated nor uncommon. The “women are too soft” argument runs rampant both online and offline. A cursory look at Facebook comments sections reveals statements as brief as “women are weak” and entire treatises on how female leaders might become puppets of the powerful and wicked. But where do all these ideas come from? Certainly not from research. There is a wide body of knowledge that examines leadership styles between the sexes (Grijalva, Eagly, and their respective colleagues, for instance, studied and published their work on the leadership styles of males vs. females). The findings are consistent: Female leaders are less narcissistic and will therefore adopt a democratic way of rule that encourages citizen participation rather than demand citizen obedience. Research doesn’t support the notion that women focus on relationships rather than getting the job done, nor does it back the notion that softness is undesirable. Both Forbes and the Harvard Business Review agree. The “strong” leader is not the man who stands alone and makes decisions, but the servant leader who generates ideas through collaboration, motivates through inspiration, and empathizes rather than commands—all traits embodied by women leaders. So why are there so few women in leadership positions? The Harvard Business Review traces it to the infrastructure: There are many opportunities for competent women, but there are no sanctions on incompetent males, hence the surplus of male leaders who tend to be unethical and overconfident in their abilities. Forbes is more incisive: People in charge of voting those into power do not select leaders based on talent or merit, but swagger and confidence. People tend to vote on style, not substance; they end up choosing leaders who exude an atmosphere of strength, but have little to show for it. It was this focus on style that emerged when I spoke with the driver. I used a research method called laddering: We ask a person “why” three times, which helps us as researchers to get to their core values, but which also helps the person confront their own loopholes in reasoning. Like many voters, the driver valued ideology and bravado, but not merit, ability, or accomplishment. I remembered the conversation with the driver as I read Pope Francis’ homily on Jan. 1, the Feast of Mary Mother of God. The Pope extolled Mary as a woman who accepted pain and humiliation, which led to her “more mature faith.” He spoke of Mary as a mother who “keeps and ponders”: she holds things in her heart, and ponders them in the silence and peace of her soul. As a mother, she brings together all the “hidden threads” that connect her experiences, looks at the world so that it can be given life, sees reality with the eyes of her heart. Pope Francis went on to talk about all mothers, and encouraged us to protect women. Enough of the violence against women, he said: “To hurt a woman is to insult God.” We often think of “hurt” as physical, but sexism and misogyny are their own forms of abuse. The humiliation online, the belittling, the dismissal, the ridicule—none of these are ever harmless. To continue to engage in such conversations, as Pope Francis might say, is to contradict the teachings of the Mother Church. To make major decisions based on baseless preconceptions is a disservice to the country—a slap in the face of the Motherland. —————- iponcedeleon@ateneo.edu"},{"url":"https://libre.inquirer.net/9004/ltfrb-denies-application-of-new-ride-hailing-company","title":"LTFRB denies application of new ride hailing company","date":"03/22/2019","snippet":"","body":" DENIED ang aplikasyon ng local subsidiary ng Go-Jek na makakuha ng accreditation bilang isang transport network company sa bansa.

The partnership—a first for Asia —will be rolled out in five markets in Asia-Pacific, beginning in the Philippines and Singapore, with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to follow shortly, Citi announced in a statement from Singapore.  “By grounding our reputation in safety, quality and availability, Grab is now the trusted, ride-hailing leader in our six markets with one in eight smartphone users in Southeast Asia already on our platform. As customers use Grab for their regular transport needs, many of them are choosing to go cashless by adopting GrabPay for a more seamless ride experience. We are thrilled to partner with Citi to extend its best-in-class loyalty capabilities to make it easier to serve and reward our customers in the region,” said Joel Yarbrough, head of payments and commerce product at Grab. “Our strategy in consumer banking is to be the world’s leading digital bank which includes delivering a remarkable client experience in key digital ecosystems. We have seen that the rapid adoption of mobile and other digital channels has truly transformed how and where people bank and we are delighted to partner with Grab. By integrating our services into key applications such as Grab we also will drive growth in our cards business via new acquisitions and increased customer loyalty,” said Anand Selva, head of Citi’s Asia Pacific consumer banking.  As part of the initial phase, customers who added their Citi credit card to GrabPay, Grab’s mobile payment platform, would receive a discounted first ride. The partnership is also seen as a way for Citi to attract cardholders among Grab users. Grab customers who sign up for any Citi credit card through the partnership gets a number of free rides worth up to $50.  The next phase will allow customers to pay for Grab rides using points. Citibank credit cardholders who charge their Citi credit card on GrabPay will receive a SMS from Citi requesting if they would like to redeem the ride for points. Upon replying with their acceptance, the redemption will be made automatically and reflected in the customer’s monthly statement. This innovative pay for rides service is the first in the region, enabling credit cardholders to easily exchange their points for on-demand redemption for smaller, daily transactions—in one step. For Citi cardholders, the points earned depend on the type of card. Generally, a cardholder earns one point for every P30 of spending. Citi and Grab will announce soon how points will be converted to Grab peso bill. Grab currently operates in 30 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam—markets and cities through which Citi offers consumer banking services including credit cards. Grab seeks to solve critical transportation challenges for 620 million people in Southeast Asia. It began as a taxi-hailing app in 2012 but it has expanded its core product platform to include private cars and motorbikes.  Grab is also testing new services such as social carpooling, as well as last mile and food deliveries."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/110540/ltfrb-much-explain","title":"LTFRB has much to explain","date":"05:28 AM January 25, 2018","snippet":"Sen. Grace Poe has every reason to suspect the actions of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board against ride-hailing service providers such as Uber and Grab.","body":"Sen. Grace Poe has every reason to suspect the actions of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board against ride-hailing service providers such as Uber and Grab. The LTFRB seems bent on making it difficult for this modern-day transport service to prosper in the country. And it’s difficult to fathom why.  It all started with the unusual delay in the LTFRB’s crafting of the implementing rules and regulations to govern the internet-era public transport service starting two years ago. And while it was taking its sweet time to come up with the rules, it ordered a freeze on the approval of franchises for the so-called transport network vehicle services (TNVS) firms.  The result: tens of thousands of prospective Uber and Grab drivers failing to get the necessary permits and, in turn, less available vehicles for the commuting public. Worse, Uber and Grab were penalized with monetary fines and threats of cancellation of their permits for accepting in their networks drivers without the LTFRB franchises, the approvals of which the agency itself had frozen.  Enter 2018 and the LTFRB is training its sights on constricting TNVS firms again. First, it wanted to ban small or compact cars from being accredited by ride-hailing companies, even if these are brand-new units. Yet, at the same time, it allows dilapidated or ill-maintained taxicabs to ply the streets of the metropolis. Poe had earlier questioned the logic behind the LTFRB plan. She argued that while safety is a paramount concern in any mode of public transportation, the fact that many hatchback or compact cars have been allowed to operate as TNVS for the past two years without incident, then the LTFRB should consider the livelihood of those to be affected by its plan. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada had been quoted as saying that the agency was planning to ban and remove the accreditation of small, compact cars or non-2,000-cc-rated vehicles for Uber and Grab, citing passenger safety. If this policy is ever implemented, then it should apply to taxicabs, of which nearly all units fall below the 2,000-cc engine rating.  Besides, Poe noted, if such small vehicles were safe for personal use and to carry family members, how are they not safe to ferry passengers? Last Monday, the senator had to again call the attention of the LTFRB for yet another move against ride-hailing service providers. The agency now wants to limit the number of cars for the entire TNVS sector to 45,000 units in the metropolis, or less than half the number currently operating in Metro Manila. The LTFRB also plans to cap the number of TNVS cars to 500 in Metro Cebu and 200 in Pampanga. The agency recently issued Memorandum Circular 2018-003, which sets a “common supply base” for TNVS providers. All ride-hailing companies will share this pool, without exceeding it. This sounds silly because there are about 100,000 TNVS vehicles operating under Uber and Grab — a number that is not sufficient to satisfy the current demand of the commuting public — and the LTFRB should start with this as the base and adjust accordingly using scientific analysis. Indeed, the LTFRB has to disclose the formula it uses to come up with those numbers. What supply-and-demand assumptions did it consider? It should make public the minutes of any consultation meetings it had to come up with those figures. Poe put it aptly: “Some formula would have been used because these figures, which are important to the riding public, cannot and should not be plucked out of thin air.” Besides, the disclosure of this important issue is what the rules on freedom of information require in the interest of transparency. If the LTFRB wants to impose such stringent measures on ride-hailing firms, fairness dictates that it should also impose the same safety standards on all kinds of public utility vehicles — taxis, jeepneys and buses.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); It should make sure that all these public transportation vehicles are safe, environmentally friendly, and comfortable. Focusing solely on ride-hailing firms only makes the LTFRB suspect."}]}
