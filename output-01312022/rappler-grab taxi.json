In a statement on Wednesday, September 22, Grab Philippines said it partnered with Move It for its motorcycle ride-hailing service. Move It will still offer motorcycle rides through its app, but the partnership will allow its riders to have a wider market given Grab’s large user base. Similar to Grab’s transport bookings, cashless payments will be implemented. Commuters can pay through credit or debit card, GrabPay credits, or by cashing in with the driver. “Through this landmark partnership, we are confident that many Filipinos will experience and enjoy its many benefits, and we are hopeful that the bike-hailing industry will continue to recover from the impacts of the pandemic,” said Move It president and chief executive officer Francis Juan. Since the service is being offered during the coronavirus pandemic, commuters will have to bring their own helmets. Commuters can book Mondays to Sundays, from 5 am to 10 pm, in the Greater Manila Area. “Our partnership with Move It is a hallmark expression of how transport stakeholders can come together for the common good, and we invite all companies to join us towards this mission,” said Grab Philippines head Grace Vera Cruz. Grab said statistics required by the Department of Transportation’s motorcycle taxi technical working group (TWG) will still be submitted. In 2020, Grab had said it was “seriously considering” entering the motorcycle taxi market “if given the chance.” The motorcycle taxi TWG, however, did not seem keen on granting authority to other players outside of the original participants in the government’s pilot study. Aside from Move It, Angkas and JoyRide were authorized to offer motorcycle ride-hailing services. The Philippine government allowed motorcycle ride-hailing services to augment transportation in Metro Manila starting October 2020, amid the limited options due to coronavirus restrictions. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/dutch-serbian-toni-vujanic-eyes-up-maroons-coaching-post/","title":"Dutch-Serbian Toni Vujanic eyes UP Maroons coaching post","date":"Aug 8, 2021 3:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Married to a Filipina, Dutch-Serbian mentor Toni Vujanic has spent time watching the UAAP and says his ‘coaching journey crossed a few times’ with Ateneo coach Tab Baldwin","body":"The list of interested applicants for the UP Fighting Maroons head coaching position continues to grow. Rappler has received confirmation from 62-year-old Dutch-Serbian coach Toni Vujanic that he has expressed his desire and willingness to join University of the Philippines and succeed Bo Perasol as mentor of the Fighting Maroons basketball program. Vujanic, who’s been a basketball coach since 1981, joins the likes of former UAAP high school champion coach Goldwin Monteverde, UAAP women’s basketball champion coach Patrick Aquino, and legendary Filipino college basketball coach Frankie Lim, among others, eyeing to coach UP’s title-contending roster whenever UAAP basketball returns. “My friends and Filipino coaches told me that there is an opportunity in UP and I took a liberty to apply for this job. Actually, I want to make my final legacy and build the ‘big’ university program that UP and me will be proud off,” Vujanic said in an exclusive interview. “Youth is the future of every country. Investing in young players and developing future talents [is] very hard… but on other side, also the most satisfying thing.” Vujanic’s basketball odyssey has seen him mentor teams in Yugoslavia, Holland, Germany, Austria, Spain, Belgium, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Cyprus, Bahrain, Iraq, Morocco, Kuwait, and, most recently, China, for the Tianjin Gold Lions in the Chinese Basketball Association. Tianjin enjoyed its best team result in the last half-decade after Vujanic took over coaching responsibilities for the roster. “You can conclude that I can bring a lot to UP or any university team,” Vujanic confidently said.  “My successful records speak for itself. But the most I would bring is the European/Serbian program that is very successful in the world in the past 30-40 years. With this style I made huge impact in teams and competitions in three continents.” Sources at University of the Philippines confirmed that a major part of Vujanic’s pitch is to adopt the European style of play for the team. “Unfortunately, in basketball of the beautiful Philippines, it’s all about the American style that doesn’t work in FIBA circles and surely not in university basketball,” Vujanic explained. “This is mostly the ‘run and gun’ style that is tailor-made for body structure of American players, but unfortunately not for young Filipino players in my humble opinion.” Vujanic explained there would be “fundamental” and “tactical” changes that he would make for his vision of a “reborn” UP basketball team. “There would be different appointments in defensive and offensive styles that would bring a recognizable UP style of basketball,” he said. “UP is a big university and deserves to win. After 35 years of dry seasons, I think that everyone is hungry for big achievements.” The head coach, who can speak three languages, hopes to be a pillar for that change in fortune. Married to a Filipina, Vujanic has spent time living in and out of Manila since 2017, which has given him the opportunity to study the different leagues in Philippine basketball, particularly the UAAP. “I know exactly what should be done in order to succeed and the most important thing is that I know the style of coach Tab Baldwin that is very successful in Ateneo and the national team,” said Vujanic.  “My coaching journey crossed a few times with coach Baldwin. UAAP basketball in the Philippines is very attractive and everyone follows it. Even the drivers of Grab taxis talk about the games with me.” In addition to being the leading voice of the Philippine men’s basketball team, Baldwin has also coached the Blue Eagles to three UAAP championships since being appointed as head coach in 2015. Vujanic confirmed that both he and his wife want to settle down and establish roots in the Philippines, which is a huge motivation for his desire to land a coaching job in the country. Doing that at University of the Philippines is his ultimate desire. “I love the country and the people here are humble and hardworking. I respect this country with unlimited basketball potential and I want to make my biggest legacy teaching young university players. To be honest, when I am in Manila, I feel like I am in my birth country of Serbia.” Sources at UP have confirmed to Rappler that interviews of the preliminary candidates have concluded, although no shortlist has been determined yet. Assistants under Perasol such as Xavi Nunag, Poch Juinio, and Moriah Gingerich are also in consideration. There is plenty of support for Aquino, who is determined to make the jump from his flawless tenure with the NU Lady Bulldogs to the Fighting Maroons to represent his alma mater in a homecoming situation that has many Iskos and Iskas excited.  There is also momentum for Monteverde, who would be reunited with a number of his blue-chip recruits from the NU Bullpups, given his impressing standing. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/262469-tnvs-units-taxis-approved-ltfrb-gcq-metro-manila/","title":"Over 23,000 TNVS units, taxis can ply Metro Manila roads again under GCQ","date":"May 31, 2020 8:38 PM PHT","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board reminds drivers, operators, and passengers to follow health protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19","body":" MANILA, Philippines – With Metro Manila placed under general community quarantine (GCQ) starting Monday, June 1, taxis and transport network vehicle services (TNVS) will be allowed to ply the metropolis again.

Under Memorandum Circular 2020-18 signed on Thursday, May 14, the LTFRB said that  its regional offices will determine the number of vehicles to be deployed, depending on “demand.” Taxis and TNVS are still prohibited in Metro Manila because of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), but the memorandum said that the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases will determine the number of vehicles once the capital region is under GCQ. The LTFRB also required operators to enforce a cashless payment scheme. Which taxis and TNVS can operate? The memorandum covers all taxi and TNVS operators that have a valid certificate of public convenience or provisional authority from the LTFRB, as well as those whose permits expired starting March 17. As LTFRB will determine the number of allowed units, transport network companies will have to submit a list of qualified TNVS operators. The regulatory board, meanwhile, will provide the TNC the final list of qualified taxi operators, after the firm submits the initial list of taxi drivers within their system. This means that all taxi operators must be under a TNC, such as dominant ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines and taxi-hailing app MiCab. To date, there are 9 accredited ride-hailing companies, including Owto, Hirna, ePickMeUp, GoLag, Hype, Snappy Cab, and Ryd Global. TNVS operators must submit to their home TNCs photocopies of their certificate of registration, Land Transportation Office (LTO) official receipt, and passenger insurance policy. TNCs must provide the LTFRB the taxi and TNVS operator’s name, case number, plate number, chassis number, and type of electronic payment in case of street-hailed passengers. \n\n Health measures: Under the Department of Transportation guidelines, TNVS and taxis should only be allowed 3 passengers, apart from the driver.

The app-based ride-hailing service was bound to become popular in cities where commuters spend hours in traffic jam every day. Under Philippine laws, however, Angkas’ status remains illegal. Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code provides that motorcycles can only be private or government vehicles. Private vehicles cannot be used for hire, while government vehicles can only be used in fulfilling government functions. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) With 9 pending bills in Congress seeking to recognize motorcycle taxis, the technical working group (TWG) set strict and specific guidelines on Angkas’ operations during the pilot run to ensure commuters’ safety. While Angkas maintained a 99.997% safety rate, new players JoyRide and Move It have yet to show similar statistics. (READ: Metro commuting in 2019: The shortcomings of the motorcycle taxi pilot run) In neighboring countries of Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, motorcycle taxis started as an informal sector and evolved into ride-hailing apps-based service that received government attention and regulation. This is how Angkas-like services operate in other Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia Ojeks, or motorcycle taxis, existed in Indonesia for many years prior to the rise of ride-hailing apps. Similar to the Philippines’ habal-habal system, ojeks were an informal means for moving people around the city. Commuters would look for an ojek shelter or hail for them wherever they could find them. Some lucky commuters developed rapport with drivers to service them regularly. Indonesia’s ride-hailing startup Gojek traces its roots back to 2010 as a motorcycle ride-hailing call center, where the company would match calling customers with ojeks.  The practice was in a gray area – no existing legal framework or regulation, but still done. For a while, the government was silent on ojeks, with no impetus to go after them since it was understood that they provided a necessary service in a city always snarled by traffic. In 2015, the Gojek app was launched as it began to expand its services beyond motorcycle taxis. Grab entered the picture in 2012. The two apps generated wide popularity as millions in investments poured in. When the apps came, the ojek system had somewhat been formalized, and that’s when the government stepped in. The Indonesian Ministry of Transportation announced in January 2019 that they had begun working to regulate fares. They understood that the mere presence of these motorcycle services needed regulation even without official government recognition. The 2009 Traffic and Land Transportation Law does not recognize two-wheeled vehicles as a public transport mode. A petition by 54 drivers to amend the law was junked by the Constitutional Court in 2018. The ministry released an ojek regulation in March 2019, with provisions on standard fares and customer safety. A ministry officer said  they would arrange meetings with Gojek and Grab to discuss minimum fares. The regulation requires drivers to wear uniforms, have valid drivers’ licenses, have adequate knowledge of street routes, and follow traffic rules. Ride-hailing companies are also required to have an emergency button and accident compensation. There are also procedures for hiring and suspending drivers. The ride-hailing companies still receive complaints and protests over their services, but there reportedly has not been much noise with regards to the government’s regulation. Thailand Ride-hailing companies have been operating in Thailand for several years. Among them is Get, a unit of Indonesia’s Gojek, that offers motorcycle taxi rides. Thailand deals with an unregulated market. An earlier form of motorcycle taxi service was called motosai, where drivers were managed by an informal operator that would provide their uniforms for a fee.  In 2014, the military government attempted to regulate the business by making the drivers buy their uniforms directly from the Thai Department of Transport. The arrival of similar services by Uber and Grab later on threatened this arrangement. Thailand suspended motorcycle taxi services from Uber and Grab in 2016, with reports saying at least 66 drivers from the companies were arrested. The actions were done on claims they “broke local rules” and were “clashing with registered transport companies.” The crackdown came 3 months after Uber launched its motorcycle taxi service in Bangkok. The Transport Ministry announced in September 2019 that it was drafting guidelines to regulate ride-hailing companies.  Currently, police reportedly stop and fine drivers for improper registration. Reports of violence among motor taxi drivers have come about amid the arrival of ride-hailing apps. “We have to look at what is possible within the law to give choice to the public – not increase competition with taxis in the system,” Transport Ministry Deputy Permanent Secretary Jirut Wisarnjit told Reuters. The regulatory framework is targeted for finalization by March 2020. Malaysia Local startup Dego Ride was the first of its kind in Malaysia, starting motorcycle taxi operations in the country in late 2016. The government quickly declared it illegal in January 2017 due to safety concerns.  Malaysian political coalition Pakatan Harapan’s Transport Minister Anthony Loke upheld the decision in September 2018, saying high motorcycle accident rates were enough reason to not legalize the services. Taxi company founder Shamsubahrin Ismail also brought up cultural factors that may show motor taxis to be problematic, asking if women passengers hugging riders would be acceptable. In August 2019, Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq lobbied with the Malaysian Cabinet to approve legalizing the service. Saddiq arranged for Loke, Gojek founder Nadiem Makarim, and the Prime Minister himself to be at the meeting. Malaysia’s The Star reported that Saddiq pitched to create youth employment through motorcycle taxi services, in line with a Pakatan election promise of creating one million job opportunities.  The Malaysian Cabinet then allowed the introduction of motorcycle taxi services in the country, subject to viability studies and legal provisions. Saddiq later met with Dego Ride after excluding the homegrown startup from the previous meeting and ensuring that the Cabinet’s approval would be applicable to all motorcycle taxi apps, not just Gojek. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/248679-grab-seriously-considering-grabbike-revival/","title":"Grab ‘seriously considering’ GrabBike revival","date":"Jan 7, 2020 11:22 AM PHT","snippet":"'Grab has prepared its approach for reviving its GrabBike service, and is ready to present to the LTFRB and the DOTr anytime it is asked to,' the company says","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing firm Grab said on Tuesday, January 7, that it is “seriously considering” the revival of its GrabBike service as the government reviews the viability of motorcycle taxis for public transport.  Grab said in a statement on Tuesday that it was reiterating “its interest in participating in the motorcycle taxi space” amid conversations on motorcycle taxis in the Philippines spurred by the motorcycle taxi pilot run. “As the government is seriously looking into a possible regulation for motorcycle taxis, Grab is seriously considering to reinvest in the motorcycle taxi denomination and relaunch its GrabBike service in the Philippines, with the blessing of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board and the Department of Transportation,” the company said. “Grab has prepared its approach for reviving its GrabBike service, and is ready to present to the LTFRB and the DOTr anytime it is asked to,” it added.

Graneta narrated the events of that ill-fated day during the Senate committee for public services hearing on Wednesday, October 2, regarding the Philippine Day of Remembrance for Road Crash Victims, Survivors, and Families. Grab denied this allegation two days later, showing the media on Friday, October 4, a photo of the check they issued to help with Graneta’s expenses.  At the Senate hearing Wednesday, Graneta said the accident occurred on September 27, 2016 at Nagtahan (now Mabini) bridge when 3 trucks collided with the Grab taxi that she and her best friend were riding in. They were trapped inside the car for almost an hour, leading to the death of her best friend. Meanwhile, Graneta was hospitalized for 6 months, undergoing 4 operations in the first 5 months. Graneta said she had aspent more than P3 million for her medical expenses. All throughout her ordeal she never received any financial assistance from Grab. “Talagang nagpapakahirap po kaming maghanap kasi syempre hindi naman po kami ganun kayaman para magkaroon ng ganyan kalaking amount (We’re really struggling because we don’t have that kind of money),” she said. ‘We were told assistance was extended’ Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chairman Martin Delgra III was surprised by this revelation, saying they were told that assistance was extended after the crash. “I’ll have to take it up with Grab as to what happened with this incident,” he said. Delgra said they followed protocol after the accident and told Grab to assist the victim immediately regardless of who was at fault. He added that they issued a show-cause order to Grab because even if the taxi driver was not at fault, it was still a public utility vehicle that has obligations to its passengers. As per LTFRB regulations, a passenger is entitled to an insurance coverage of P100,000 for injuries.  Senator Grace Poe said she would also follow up with Grab regarding the incident. The committee on public services, which Poe heads, is lobbying for the creation of  a National Transportation Safety Board that would probe crash incidents.  On Friday, October 4, Grab denied Graneta’s allegation, saying their representative personally visited Graneta’s family to know how they could be of assistance and that they had issued a check worth around P166,000 to Graneta’s uncle, Roel Capuno. Graneta on Monday, October 7, refuted this, saying the money her family received came from an organization of taxi drivers, but she refused to give anymore details, as advised by her lawyers.  The ride-hailing company provided a picture of the check that was received by Capuno on behalf of Graneta. The account name indicated “MyTaxi.ph Inc,” the company of Grab.  The demand for damages based on the quasi-delict case filed by Graneta against Grab 3 years ago is pending in court. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/236750-guide-gems-secret-spots-hanoi-vietnam/","title":"Exploring Hanoi, Vietnam: Hidden gems, secret spots","date":"Aug 6, 2019 11:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Planning to visit Hanoi soon?

Most of us might assume that Saigon is the capital, when in fact, it’s actually Hanoi.  This city’s got this Old-World, laid-back charm and was branded as the little Paris of the East (Ho Chi Minh City is the modern pulse of the country). It is also known as the gateway to Ha Long Bay, but what you’ll really like in Hanoi is the city itself. It’s full of romantic, poetic places – if there’s such a thing. The locals always seem to put poise into things – nooks and crannies of a humble café located at a crumbling French colonial building are typically decorated with fresh roses in vases, and undisturbed locals drinking lotus tea in the afternoon pepper the sidewalks amid the traffic rush. There’s almost a feeling of contentment and solace in most of these places despite the chaos in the city. These simple things are what make Hanoi charming.  Forget the usual touristy haunts – the Temple of Literature, Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, or even Ha Long Bay. Enter the quiet and relaxing side of Hanoi and explore relaxing cafes, peaceful spots, and hidden gems which will lead you back to its old-fashioned allure.  Here is a sample itinerary together with some guides and tips for when you visit Hanoi. This was also inspired by a question randomly asked by a friend who’s planning on going on a solo trip, but couldn’t decide whether to see Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) or Hanoi. Hopefully, this guide will help you decide in choosing if Hanoi is the best fit for your travel preference. The goal of this trip is mostly to explore Hanoi’s quiet spots and quaint cafes, and photowalk at the Old Quarter. Upon arrival at Noi Bai international Airport Terminal 2 at 12 midnight (I flew in via Cebu Pacific), the first few things you should do:  Tips when sleeping at Noi Bai airport Terminal 2:  How to go to Old Quarter from the airport via public bus. Just outside the Arrivals entrance doors is public bus #86 (color orange), which drops you off at the city center. Bus # 86 stops nearest to Old Quarter: Other tips: If you have heavy luggage or are with a group, it’s better to get a taxi. Alighting from Long Bien station still requires a 20-30 minute walk going to Hoan Kiem Lake area, so it’s not a recommended stop and you’ll be dropped off at a bus stop located along a busy road with lots of tours. It’s better to alight at 142 Tran Quang Khai or Hanoi Opera House which seems to be nearer Old Quarter.

In the conclusion to its investigation, the commission said it had found the merger had substantially reduced “competition in the ride-hailing platform market in Singapore.” Grab fares rose between 10% and 15% after the deal as the company reduced the number of points earned by riders and made it harder for them to redeem them, it said. Potential competitors were hampered by exclusivity agreements Grab forged with taxi companies, car rental partners, and some of its drivers, the commission said. The deals meant drivers could not work for other companies. The commission fined both firms a total Sg$13 million ($9.5 million) – Sg$6.42 million for Grab and Sg$6.58 million for Uber – “to deter completed, irreversible mergers that harm competition.” The body also criticized Grab and Uber for not getting the commission’s clearance before completing the deal. In addition to the fines, the commission ordered several measures be implemented to ease fares and allow new players to compete with Grab, including reverting to pre-merger pricing and allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing platforms. Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore, said the firm completed the deal “within its legal rights, and still maintains we did not intentionally or negligently breach competition laws.” In the Philippines, the competition watchdog last month approved the merger but imposed conditions related to areas including pricing and exclusivity arrangements to prevent Grab acting like a monopoly. Malaysian authorities are also examining the deal. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/203278-new-ride-hailing-apps-philippines-fares/","title":"How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?","date":"May 24, 2018 8:10 PM PHT","snippet":"Aside from Grab and U-Hop, Filipino commuters can now choose from MiCab, HirNa, Owto, Hype, and Go Lag","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Do you know the new ride-hailing apps? With the exit of Uber from the Philippine ride-hailing market, many Filipino commuters were left with only Grab. But in April, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited 5 new ride-hailing companies that offer booking services for taxis, sedans, and other vehicle types. So who are the new players and what can they offer? And more importantly, how much will they charge?  New ride-hailing apps MiCab MiCab Systems Corporation is a taxi-hailing company which traces its roots to a startup ideation camp in Cebu City in 2012. It has been operating in the city since then. MiCab is a wordplay for Mobile Internet Cab, with the aim to modernize taxi operations. (WATCH: 6 questions with the founder of new Grab competitor, Micab) With its accreditation, MiCab looks at venturing into the Metro Manila market while maintaining operations in Cebu, Iloilo, and Davao. MiCab does not charge booking fees. Commuters only have to pay what is on the taxi meter. Under government-approved fares, taxis charge a P40 flagdown rate, with an additional P13.50 every 300 meters and P2 per minute travel. The company supports its operations through MiAds or advertisements placed inside its taxis. HirNa Like MiCab, HirNa Mobility Solutions Incorporated is another transport network company (TNC) that is focused on giving taxis a platform for bookings. HirNa chief executive officer Coco Mauricio earlier said they saw the “need to tap into an existing transportation mode such as taxis.” The company started in Davao City in 2017 as part of the city’s transportation master plan. HirNa is now looking at expanding to Metro Manila, Iligan City in Lanao del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental. The app has a 24/7 hotline service for bookings to cater to commuters who do not have smartphones. It also has a button within the app that directly connects to the hotline of the LTFRB, should there be problems with the ride. To place bookings, patrons don’t have to put their destination, unlike other ride-hailing apps. They can choose between a taxi sedan or a taxi AUV. HirNa doesn’t charge booking fees as well, with commuters paying only what is on the taxi meter. The LTFRB recently allowed all ride-hailing firms to charge P2/min travel. This means that Hirna may start charging per-minute rates starting September 21, if they decide to do so. Owto Owto is a TNC by Ipara Technologies and Solutions Incorporated, founded by former Grab and Uber drivers who wanted to make the ride-hailing industry a profitable one for drivers. Paulo Libertad, Owto’s chief operating officer, said they charge the smallest commission among other companies at 15%. The average commission charged is at 20% of driver’s earnings, not including incentives. Owto recently launched on May 18. Like Uber and Grab, it offers transport network vehicle services for sedans around Metro Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, and Cavite. It also has a pooling feature. It charges a fee of P50 if cancellations are done 3 minutes after the booking was made. Under its approved fares, Owto charges a base fare of P40, with an additional P12 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. They set a surge cap of times two the fare for the distance traveled and duration of the ride. Go Lag Go Laguna, or Go Lag for short, is a ride-hailing service looking at offering rides to Greater Metro Manila Area commuters, who are sometimes rejected by existing ride-hailing drivers because of the distance. Originally intended to serve the province of Laguna, Go Lag expanded its intended market to Metro Manila, Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan. Go Lag has yet to launch its app, but is currently accepting driver applications. It will be a ride-hailing platform for sedans. Go Lag will be charging a base fare of P40, on top of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. Surge pricing is capped at 1.5 times. Hype  Among the TNCs, Hype Transport Systems focuses on the security of both drivers and commuters. Though the app is not yet available for download, Hype will feature an “SOS” button in times of emergencies. Hype will offer different vehicle types for commuters ranging from taxis and sedans to AUVs and SUVs. It will also offer a ride-sharing service for sedans. The flagdown rate for each service depends on the vehicle type. Sedans will have a base of P40. For SUVs, it’s at P70, and for vans, P100. There will be an additional charge of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute, with a surge cap at times two the charge. Meanwhile, Hype’s ride-sharing service has a P30 flagdown rate on top of P9.50 per kilometer travel. Existing ride-hailing apps Grab Grab, through MyTaxi.PH, has been in the Philippine market since 2013, offering taxi-hailing services. In 2015, it launched its private vehicle booking service as well as more luxurious cars. Grab is available in Metro Manila and major cities around the Philippines. It recently got involved in a controversy involving its fares, when PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused it of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge was suspended in April. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) LTFRB said that Grab can now charge P2 per minute since it allowed all firms to do so, but the order will not affect its pending case before the regulatory board. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated TNCs’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40 for sedans, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. For a 6-seater vehicle, Grab charges a flagdown rate of P60, with P13 to P19 per kilometer. For premium cars, the base fare is at P70 on top of P16 to P23 per kilometer. Grab launched a 100-day campaign geared toward improving driver and passenger experience. It is looking at imposing cancellation fees as well. U-Hop U-Hop was granted a license to operate as a TNC by the LTFRB back in March 2016. Among TNCs, U-Hop is the only company that offers shuttle services to individuals and companies. When it launched in July 2016, U-Hop only offered shuttle services with a capacity of 7 passengers. It now offers the same services as Uber and Grab, which is to pre-arrange taxi, private car, and social carpooling rides. It is operational in Metro Manila, Cebu, and other major cities. But in February, U-Hop was suspended in Batangas, with the local government requiring documents necessary for operations. U-Hop charges P40 for sedans, P70 for SUVs, and P100 for vans, with an additional P14.75 to P15.75 per kilometer and P2 per minute of travel. For companies, they charge a monthly membership of P3,999 for 40 prioritized rides. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/200558-grab-philippines-higher-fares-complain-taxi/","title":"‘Mag-taxi ka na lang’: Netizens tell riders complaining of higher fares","date":"Apr 19, 2018 8:24 AM PHT","snippet":"'Kung di mo afford, mag-taxi ka na lang, or tricycle, jeep.

Grab Philippines head Brian Cu explained on Wednesday, April 18, that fares are “not higher” because they “did not increase fare pricing” after they acquired Uber. Cu said it appears that fares are higher because Grab absorbed “100% of the demand” when Uber left the market but they have yet to absorb all Uber drivers to meet the demand. “The demand base is fully absorbed. It’s easier for the demand to flow than it is for the supply to flow,” he said. (READ: Grab: When Uber shuts down, not all 20,000 drivers have moved to us) According to Cu, about 40% of the Uber drivers from their masterlist had onboarded with Grab since they started the process early April. The country head also said that they will be employing stricter measures to avoid driver cancellations such as changing their incentive scheme for drivers. Cathy Toh, Grab Philippines marketing head, also invited passengers to continue reporting impertinent drivers. She said they had doubled their internal customer service team to address their woes. Grab is the only transport network company currently offering ride-hailing services in the Philippines, after Uber closed down on April 16. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board on Wednesday accredited Hype Transport Systems Incorporated and Hirna Mobility Solutions Inc. Hype and Hirna can begin operations only after they receive their accreditation papers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/188664-travel-guide-hanoi-vietnam/","title":"[Vietnam travel guide] Hanoi: The chaos and charms of the capital","date":"Nov 17, 2017 10:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Planning to explore Hanoi? Here's what you need to check out","body":"Jona Bering’s travel guide to northern Vietnam is a 4-part series. First up: what to see, eat, and do in the country’s busy capital, Hanoi.  For long-time travelers, it is sometimes hard to pick a place when asked, “What’s the most beautiful place you’ve been to so far?” I would stammer, and a train of places would come rushing to my mind. Often, I answer the question with another question: how do you define “beautiful?”  For a writer, well at least for me, a place is beautiful when there’s something about it that you want to write about. And sometimes, writable places can be challenging to travel to. Defining a beautiful place is always subjective. I’ve met someone who did not rave about Vietnam as much as I did, so take this list with a grain of salt.  If we narrow down the definition of “beautiful” to something more tangible, like landscape, northern Vietnam is on top of my top list.  Three elements recur in northern Vietnam’s landscapes: flatlands of varying hues of green, water – be it fresh or salt – and the dramatic limestone formations. Sometimes, they tease you by appearing in the periphery of your vision; other times, they burst out in the open. Either way, the scenes left me sighing with gratitude and awe.  Hanoi  We flew to northern Vietnam after 3 weeks in southern Vietnam. We had gotten so used to the southern Vietnam hospitality and kindness that we instinctively thought Hanoi would not be any different. But it was as if the city had a mischievous plan in mind – well, at least, on the first night.  When you are in Hanoi, it is financially and emotionally practical to opt for an Uber, Grab, or bus. Some taxi drivers will scam you once they figure out you’re not a local. That being said, we got victimized on a hefty ten-minute taxi ride on the night we arrived in Hanoi.  Even southern Vietnamese get scammed – how much more if you are a foreigner? Despite the awkward first meeting, Hanoi and I get along pretty well. If it is your first time in the capital, here are some of the must-dos.  1. Hang out at Hoan Kiem Lake   The road surrounding the lake is closed on weekends. Expect a high volume of tourists on weekends. There’s a lot of activity in the area: singing, dancing, eating, and many other activities you can expect in a touristy place.  Some students come here to look for foreigners to practice their English with. Some couples will have prenuptial photoshoots around the lake during the day and in front of Trang Tien Plaza at night.   Visit Hoan Kiem Lake on a weekday morning, at around 6:30 to 8 am. It is an entirely different place. Locals often start their day doing stretches, zumba, badminton, and tai chi here. If you are traveling somewhere between May and July, expect the fragrance of barringtonia acutangula tree flowers, locally known as lộc vừng, to tease your senses. Of course, the lovely fire trees bloom this time of the year too.  2. Eat bun cha Because you cannot find it elsewhere in Vietnam. It is a plate of glass noodles, pork balls, and herbs. Yum! 3. Explore the Old Quarter Here, women wearing non la and with quang gánh (a bent wood where they hang their baskets of goods) on one shoulder trod the streets, looking for people to buy their flowers, fruits, or vegetables. The streets are awash with restaurants, cafes, shops, boutiques, and hostels. Looking at the old French buildings made me think of suffocation. Negative space doesn’t exist here. Everything is cramped. But despite the lack of space, those dirtied blue-yellow buildings felt nostalgic.   4. Visit café after café The Vietnamese are tea and coffee drinkers. Tea is served alongside coffee. Quaint cafes are aplenty in Hanoi. I ended up frequenting Caphe Cong (Communist Café), the branch overlooking the tiny waterless fountain by Hoan Kiem Lake. Its bestselling coconut coffee blend and green rice milk blend are worth trying, especially in hot and humid days. Giảng Café, on the other hand, is a must for their famous egg coffee. If you want some quietude, try Jouri. If you’re a book and coffee lover, Nest by AIA makes you snap endless photos. These are just 4 of the hundreds of quaint cafes you can find in Hanoi.   5. Soak in the historical places   Imperial Citadel of Thang Long, a UNESCO Heritage site, was the center of political power that spanned 13 centuries uninterrupted. Built in 1070, the Temple of Literature, a Temple of Confucius in Hanoi, is a favorite destination for local students and foreign travelers alike. The resting place of the legendary revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh, the smiling old man gracing Vietnamese Dong, the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum should be in your schedule. To know more about the lives of Vietnamese women, squeeze some hours in for the Vietnamese Women’s Museum. Up for some pottery lessons? You can try it at Bat Trang Ceramic Village, an hour away from the center.  Things to consider before traveling to Vietnam  Flights to Vietnam  If you intend to travel to northern Vietnam alone, you can book a direct Manila-Hanoi flight via Cebu Pacific Air. As rule of thumb when trying to score cheap flights, always book them in advance and stalk promo fare announcements. I blogged about some personally tried-and-tested tricks to finding the best deals online. Visa concerns Since the Philippines and Vietnam are part of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Filipinos don’t need a tourist visa to enter Vietnam. We are allowed to stay up to 21 days visa-free. If you intend to stay longer than that (I stayed for 3 months in northern Vietnam), then you need a tourist visa. You can either go through a travel agency or process it yourself beforehand in the Philippines. Since I am traveling long-term, I processed mine in a travel agency in Cambodia and paid $54 for a 3-month single entry tourist visa. Roughly sort out your itinerary. Since most Filipinos don’t really have the time and money to travel long-term, it is safe to say that 21 days or less should be enough to cover most destinations in Vietnam.  Food in Vietnam   Vietnamese food occupies a good part of my shaped love for this country. The food is varied and Instagrammable. Rice, noodles, soups, vegetables, and meat – Vietnam has everything a foodie could ask for. If you know where to look, they also have a version of our carinderia. They have a version of lechon, rice cakes, cassava cakes, and vegetable soup that is very closed to utan-bisaya (a favorite for many Visayans like me). The similarity of the food made Vietnam close to my stomach, where my heart resides comfortably most of the time.  If you have a sensitive tummy, don’t forget to pack activated charcoal, amoeba medication, and diarrhea pills. Fortunately, I did not have any health problems when we had our culinary adventures in Vietnam.  Your Motorbiking Skills Vietnam gained the nickname motorbike country for a reason. Scooters and semi-automatics are the to-go transportation throughout the country. Most, if not all, households own one or two motorbikes. Even though I consider myself an expert habal-habal (the Cebuano word for public motorbike transportation) passenger – in the Philippines and our traffic is maddening – nothing prepared me for Vietnam. The roads in major cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh can be intimidating even for the most experienced commuter. So if you doubt your motorbiking skills, then take the public transportation in big cities. Grab and Uber come handy. Except for Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh, and places with treacherous roads like Ha Giang, Vietnam is navigable.   Your Road Trip Route It all depends on your time and budget. As a Filipino, I know you must have limited leaves from work. And there is the money issue too. Traveling long-term yet within a budget, we covered (in order) Ha Noi, Ninh Binh, Ha Long Bay, Sa Pa, Ha Giang, Cao Bang, and Lang Son exactly for a month. There are direct buses to these places from Ha Noi. If you intend to skewer and cram these places on your trip, I wrote about our route on my northern Vietnam Travel Guide on my blog. I included a lot of photos from our own trip too. – Rappler.com Jona Branzuela Bering, Palanca awardee and author of the poetry collection Alang sa Nasaag (For the Lost), blogs at Backpacking with a Book.

Dagdag P30 (It’s traffic already. Add P30).” I politely declined but he insisted it’s only fair because it’s rush hour traffic. I still said no.

Based on the meter, my ride was worth P176.50, and I paid exactly that.</p> <h5>Vern: Angkas</h5> <p>8:10 am – I was pretty confident that I’d be the one who would get to Ayala Triangle first. I booked a bike quite quickly and the Angkas app said it would be at the pick-up point in 5 minutes.</p> <p>8:18 am – The bike I rode had no plate number but no matter, I guess – we’re off!</p> <img id=”F96DDA1B09EF4D1DBA302699F43BAE43″ src=”http://assets.rappler.com/B67D5C1F461E43EAAD3D24219D90B667/img/F96DDA1B09EF4D1DBA302699F43BAE43/IMG_1225.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Photo by Vernise L. Tantuco/Rappler ” data-parentid=”” /> <p>8:23 am – We get to Bonny Serrano corner EDSA and there were quite a few bikes waiting at the stoplight with us. It was oddly comforting to see so many people start their day the same way – they were my fellow commuters, only in separate vehicles. My biker/driver commented on the heat. Being exposed to the elements was definitely a downside to motorcycles.</p> <img id=”EAA9243F57F3496AAA31EAD3EC40E471″ src=”http://assets.rappler.com/B67D5C1F461E43EAAD3D24219D90B667/img/EAA9243F57F3496AAA31EAD3EC40E471/IMG_1229.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Photo by Vernise L. Tantuco/Rappler ” data-parentid=”” /> <p>8:56 am – My biker missed my stop, but he let me off across Ayala Triangle. I crossed the street to get to the meeting point and I was still the first one to get there! My trip cost P177.</p> <h5>Amanda: Bus</h5> <p>8:12 am – I caught the first South-bound bus on EDSA that I saw. It was standing room only by the time I got on. I squeezed myself into one side, taking care not to push my backpack onto the face of the lady sitting in front of me. She was obviously irked at the invasion of her personal space, but I think she knew neither of us had a say in the matter.</p> <img id=”821775753935458D993B5B4EA0074428″ src=”http://assets.rappler.com/F6CAA636330B4629A75C2F0D0417B3C8/img/821775753935458D993B5B4EA0074428/P_20170818_081229.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Photo by Amanda T. Lago/Rappler ” data-parentid=”” /> <p>8:19 am – The conductor started asking people where they were getting off and collecting their fares. I paid P26 to get off along Ayala Avenue in Makati. There was an old Pinoy movie playing on the TV but no one was watching. Everyone just looked tired and it was only early morning.</p> <img id=”6AC4344E30BD4AA6A7B0D2DABA1E4321″ src=”http://assets.rappler.com/F6CAA636330B4629A75C2F0D0417B3C8/img/6AC4344E30BD4AA6A7B0D2DABA1E4321/P_20170818_081405.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Photo by Amanda T. Lago/Rappler ” data-parentid=”” /> <p>8:22 am – No one wanted to end up at the back of the bus as the conductor tried playing human Tetris with passengers, asking them to move further into the bus so more passengers could get in.. The people ignored him or pretended not to hear. The conductor lost his temper – “Kung ayaw mo umatras, mag-taxi ka (If you don’t want to move, take a taxi).” I moved across the aisle to avoid becoming the subject of his anger.</p> <p>8:30 am – The couple in the seats in front of me got off! Yay seats!</p> <img id=”75D09353ADC940229432DA3842E38B27″ src=”http://assets.rappler.com/F6CAA636330B4629A75C2F0D0417B3C8/img/75D09353ADC940229432DA3842E38B27/P_20170818_082723_BF.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Photo by Amanda T. Lago/Rappler ” data-parentid=”” /> <p>8:45 am – The bus inched in front of Starmall. The driver was waiting for passengers, I think. At this point, I thought that the bus might become sardine-packed again by the time we get to Ayala.</p> <p>8:51 am – The irritated conductor yelled out for passengers getting off at Boni. The bus wasn’t allowed to stop on Boni apparently, but they were going to try to flout the rules. The conductor instructed the driver to stop a few meters away from Boni so Boni people could get off. “Maglakad na lang kayo ng konti (Just walk a little),” he told them.</p> <p>8:55 am – The bus driver stepped hard on the brakes because of a swerving car, I think. The irritated conductor let out a curse, “Putang ina ‘tong mga Uber na ‘to (This Uber son of a bitch).”</p> <p>9:09 am – Bus stopped at Ayala Triangle where I was supposed to get off but unloading was not allowed! I needed to get down at the next stop. </p> <img id=”07A1404948084373B5D97137CA58E87A” src=”http://assets.rappler.com/F6CAA636330B4629A75C2F0D0417B3C8/img/07A1404948084373B5D97137CA58E87A/P_20170818_091646.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /> <p>9:12 am – I got off at Paseo and used one of the underpasses. It was a short walk but going up and down the stairs was tiring.</p> <p>9:30 am – I arrived at Clock In. I looked harried and sweaty, definitely not presentable!</p> </div></div></div><div class=”card”><div class=”card-header” role=”tab” id=”headingTwo”><h3 class=”mb-0″><a class=”collapsed” data-toggle=”collapse” data-parent=”#accordion” href=”#collapseTwo” aria-expanded=”false” aria-controls=”collapseTwo”>Afternoon Commute</a></h3></div><div id=”collapseTwo” class=”collapse” role=”tabpanel” aria-labelledby=”headingTwo”><div class=”card-block”> <h5>Alexa: Train</h5> <p>2:30 pm – After another 20 minute walk to get to the MRT Ayala station, I managed to get inside a train easily.

Again, even if it wasn’t rush hour, there were still a good many people trying to make their way in.</p> <p>2:50 pm – Finally arrived at the Shaw Boulevard station. My plan was to walk from Shangri-La to Pearl Drive because there was a free bus to get to Estancia from there. However, it rained hard all of a sudden and I had to find shelter in a building and wait for the rain to subside.</p> <p>3:00 pm – I missed my bus. The next one would arrive in an hour!

Thank God I was inside a car.</p> <p>2:50 pm – I reached Estancia at exactly 2:50 pm and paid the cab P124.</p> <h5>Vern: Angkas</h5> <p>2:19 pm – I had a meeting in the office at 3 pm, but I should be able to beat the traffic on a motorcycle, right? My ride showed up 11 minutes after I booked it. This biker didn’t have any masks left and he had music blasting from his phone! We’re off, weaving through traffic and listening to hits by Parokya ni Edgar and Bruno Mars.</p> <img id=”78E4AFEC4E784CA785CF562F2EF422F1″ src=”http://assets.rappler.com/B67D5C1F461E43EAAD3D24219D90B667/img/78E4AFEC4E784CA785CF562F2EF422F1/IMG_1256.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Photo by Vernise L.

My rider parked at a gas station where many other bikers were taking shelter from the sudden downpour. I explained that I was running late for a meeting and he put a raincoat on me, fixed the helmet on my head, and we headed out again.</p> <img id=”1175BF80285F4243A602CFCC2FC00008″ src=”http://assets.rappler.com/B67D5C1F461E43EAAD3D24219D90B667/img/1175BF80285F4243A602CFCC2FC00008/IMG_1265.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Photo by Vernise L.

My trip cost P90.</p> <h5>Amanda: Bus</h5> <p>2:15 pm – I got on the bus passing Crossing Ibabaw. It was still roomy; no one was standing. Fare going to Crossing was P14. We hit traffic on the flyover to EDSA.</p> <img id=”A985F7E7E32A49899079957887BC6854″ src=”http://assets.rappler.com/F6CAA636330B4629A75C2F0D0417B3C8/img/A985F7E7E32A49899079957887BC6854/P_20170818_141349.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Photo by Amanda T. Lago/Rappler ” data-parentid=”” /> <p>2:46 pm – I got down at Crossing, just as it started to drizzle. I walked to the jeepney stop across Shangri-la mall and settled myself inside the jeep as the drizzle got stronger. The jeep was already full but the driver believed that we could fit one more person in. Potential passengers came and peeked in, but no one seemed to want to squeeze into the few inches of space that the driver was determined to fill.</p> <p>2:59 pm – Someone finally took that sliver of a seat and the jeep finally left. I paid P8, which I thought was standard minimum fare. The driver asked me where I was getting off and I told him my destination, which was not so far from the jeepney stop. He insisted that the fare going there was P15. I asked him why. He said, far or near the fare was P15. “May pila kasi,” one passenger explained. Sigh, jeep logic.</p> <img id=”FE293A7D53374815A0323A27D2BC315F” src=”http://assets.rappler.com/F6CAA636330B4629A75C2F0D0417B3C8/img/FE293A7D53374815A0323A27D2BC315F/P_20170818_145627.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Photo by Amanda T.

If you think I had the advantage by leaving so early, think again.</p> <p>6:21 pm – I got to Shangri-La to catch the Shaw train. I had to walk again because the number of people trying to get a jeep made it impossible for me to catch a quick ride. It didn’t help that it was also raining. I felt like I walked more than I rode the MRT today.</p> <p>6:30 pm – Got to the MRT station and I wanted to cry when I saw the long lines before me. It was still raining hard so I tried not get to soaked while waiting in a line that extended beyond the stairs.</p> <p>6:40 pm – Finally got inside the MRT bound for Taft.</p> <p>7:00 pm – I got to the Taft station and walked again to switch to the LRT.</p> <p>7:12 pm – Two trains had passed by and the line was getting longer</p> <p>7:24 pm – Finally got into train bound for Vito Cruz.</p> <p>7:38 pm – After arriving at Vito Cruz, I had to walk to a jeep terminal to get to CCP. I began to worry that I might not be able to make it to my show.</p> <p>7:54 pm – Finally made it to CCP with barely any time to spare!</p> <h5>Alecs: Taxi</h5> <p>7:15 pm – I usually didn’t leave the office at this hour because I knew traffic was hell, especially along Shaw Blvd., EDSA, Makati – okay, practically everywhere! Good luck to us.</p> <p>7:25 pm – It had been 10 minutes and it looked like I was far from finding a taxi. The traffic I saw in front of me had barely even moved! I only saw 3 cabs, all with passengers inside. This wasn’t a good sign.</p> <img id=”D6D1F3ADB1324D03A09C81A6B1FF6DF8″ src=”http://assets.rappler.com/751CBB6CEDC54051B744FD94B8CB762C/img/D6D1F3ADB1324D03A09C81A6B1FF6DF8/37.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ” data-parentid=”” /> <p>7:30 pm – I began to wonder if I could even get a cab here, and I was sure if I did get to hail one, the chances of rejection was very high. Suddenly I saw it: an empty cab! I rushed towards it and asked the driver if he could drop me off at DLSU, Manila. He paused for a while. I silently prayed, “Please, please say yes.” When he looked at me and said yes, I was so happy and I felt so lucky! I was expecting to be turned down by at least 7 taxis before one would accept me.</p> <p>7:40 pm – The driver, Kuya Joey, loved to talk. I didn’t converse with the first two drivers I encountered today, but Kuya Joey seemed fun. I asked him why taxi drivers often declined passengers. He said, we were not only paying for the fare going there but also paying for the driver’s efforts. He explained how difficult it was to be a driver stuck in traffic. Driving was extremely tiring, he said, and the meter was still running even if the taxi wasn’t moving. Gas was a main factor, too – fuel was still being consumed even while the car was practically parked in traffic and if this went on for hours, the fare of the passengers would be barely enough to cover the amount of gas spent by the driver.</p> <p>8:45 pm – We reached DLSU! One hour and 15 minutes! I didn’t know which surprised me more, that we reached Manila from Pasig this quickly, or that the ride itself didn’t even feel as long as it actually was. I told Kuya Joey I had a pretty good day and that I felt lucky that things went my way. He said, because of this, this too was his lucky day. The ride was worth P245 but I gave him P300 and told him to keep the change.</p> <img id=”E910C224516C487D85C23A23DC876C24″ src=”http://assets.rappler.com/751CBB6CEDC54051B744FD94B8CB762C/img/E910C224516C487D85C23A23DC876C24/46.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ” data-parentid=”” /> <h5>Vern: Angkas</h5> <p>7:17 pm – It’s been drizzling on and off, but I need to head to Wildflour in Makati for dinner with a friend. I booked a ride and wait.</p> <p>7:31 pm – What was initially supposed to be a 5-minute wait turned into 14. I think my driver missed a turn and ended up much further away, so I cancelled that ride and tried to book another one.</p> <p>7:34 pm – My new rider asked me to cancel the ride because his motorcycle broke down.</p> <p>7:55 pm – After a lot of waiting, I ended up walking to a Starbucks near Shaw Boulevard and was able to book a ride from there.</p> <p>8:06 pm – There was a bit of traffic tonight, but that’s expected since it was a Friday and it rained all afternoon.</p> <p>8:21 pm – We’re on EDSA and it’s raining slightly, but we were breezing past the cars that were stuck in traffic because of a road accident up ahead.</p> <p>8:36 pm – On Paseo de Roxas, there were a lot of cars and a lot of stoplights. In hindsight, the driver should have stuck to EDSA to avoid all these red lights.</p> <p>8:49 pm – I was hungry and dizzy but I finally got to Wildfour. My last trip of the day cost P131. After dinner, I ended up hitching a car ride home – I’d had enough motorcycles for one day.</p> <h5>Amanda: Bus</h5> <p>7:21 pm – Traffic was heavy and the jeeps were not moving. I took the opportunity to board the jeep of my choice.</p> <p>7:30 pm – I was still stuck on the spot where I boarded the jeep. </p> <p>7:39 pm – The jeep was just about to cross its first intersection. The driver and I chatted a bit. He was regretting taking his jeep out, saying he only did so because he saw that an old lady needed a ride.</p> <p>7:51 pm – The jeep went off our supposed route.

I had to pay P320 for the Grab taxi. <h5>Amanda: Bus</h5> <p>9:00 pm – I walked to Shaw boulevard to take a jeep.

Supply and demand is taught on Day One of any basic economics class for two good reasons. First, it explains why prices go up during times of relative scarcity and down during times of relative plenty. Second – and perhaps more importantly – supply and demand arms students with a simple yet powerful framework by which to understand government intervention in markets, and how such policies can improve or worsen society’s welfare. In this article we use supply and demand to explain the fascinating economics of Uber and Grab, and predict the likely impact of LTFRB’s regulations on both their riders and drivers. Regulating the number of Uber and Grab vehicles Each Uber or Grab ride is mutually beneficial to the rider who hails it and the driver who supplies it. Otherwise, they wouldn’t bother transacting with each other on the apps. So when the government prohibits such rides – partially or totally – it eliminates such gains from trade. Riders and drivers can’t benefit from the rides they can’t take, and this reduces social welfare.  This is what happens when the LTFRB limits the number of Uber and Grab vehicles, whether by imposing quotas or prohibitions. Consider Uber’s one-month suspension that started on August 15. Beyond the many angry comments, hashtags, and memes that it inspired on Facebook and Twitter, the welfare losses from such suspension could prove huge in monetary terms. In the US, one study found that UberX generated about $6.8-billion worth of consumer welfare in 2015 alone. No such study yet exists for the Philippines. But given the hundreds of thousands of rides that don’t happen anymore because of the suspension, the losses for riders and drivers could easily amount to several millions of pesos daily. Regulating ‘surge pricing’ Market prices orchestrate the decisions of consumers and producers. In the case of Uber and Grab, riders want to hail vehicles when prices are low, while drivers want to ply the streets when prices are high (or “surge”). Governments worldwide are particularly keen to regulate “surge pricing.” It is often taken as a form of price gouging, akin to what happens when prices of basic commodities rise during times of short supply (think Yolanda or Marawi). In the previous Christmas season, the LTFRB warned Uber and Grab against these “unreasonable” price surges that “take advantage” of people. But far from abusing people, this “dynamic pricing” mechanism – afforded by algorithms – lies at the heart of the dependability of Uber and Grab. By allowing prices to rise and fall with changes in supply and demand, riders can reliably hail vehicles whenever, wherever. Figure 1 below shows surge pricing in action. Notice the rise of driver supply (green) in response to a rise in demand (red). Surge pricing makes sure that demand always meets supply, and a similar phenomenon occurs whenever it suddenly rains or it’s rush hour in Metro Manila.   Figure 1. UberX supply rises to meet higher demand. Source: Hall, Kendrick, and Nosko (2015). Tinkering with dynamic pricing – by imposing a price ceiling beyond which prices can’t surge – will not just diminish the reliability of Uber and Grab, but also prolong wait times. Entrants that lack dynamic pricing altogether (such as taxis using the new Micab) are also therefore unlikely to match the availability of Uber and Grab vehicles. To see the effect of price controls, one need only look at the first day of Uber’s recent suspension. Bookings for Grab rides jumped by 10% to 15%, and Grab managers responded by capping their surge rates at 1.4 (meaning their rates can’t go beyond 1.4 times the regular rates). But the effects of such a binding “price ceiling” are well-known in Econ 101: It creates excess demand, where demand exceeds supply. In Grab’s case, more riders were willing to hail rides than there were Grab vehicles on the road, resulting in a shortage of vehicles and longer wait times. Grab wanted to help riders with this surge cap, but ended up making them wait longer for their rides. Regulating work hours LTFRB also came up with a proposal to impose “minimum work hours” on Uber and Grab drivers. They reasoned that the franchises they issue will be put to waste if many drivers don’t ply the streets at least a certain number of hours per week. But again, this proposal ignores the centrality of supply and demand in Uber and Grab’s operations: With dynamic pricing, both prices and the number of cars on the road have to adjust freely to reflect supply and demand. During peak hours – when demand is high – prices rise to incentivize drivers to go out and drive. By contrast, during off-peak hours – when demand is low – prices go down, which turns off most drivers, many of whom choose not to drive. The net effect is that ride-hailing vehicles typically have higher “capacity utilization rates” than taxis. Simply put, Uber and Grab drivers are far likelier than taxi drivers to ply the streets with passengers in their cars. In a 2016 paper, two economists confirmed this when they looked at UberX in 5 American cities in 2015. Figure 2 shows that, in Los Angeles, UberX was 58% more efficient than taxis; in Seattle, 41%.  Figure 2: Capacity utilization rate for taxi and UberX drivers in Los Angeles and Seattle. Source: Cramer and Krueger (2016). Capacity utilization rate = percent of miles driven with a passenger.   Again, no similar study yet exists for the Philippines. But if the LTFRB requires Uber and Grab drivers to work minimum hours, supply and demand tells us their vehicles will likely become idler on the road. Heed the law of supply and demand One might argue that, in all this, the LTFRB – with all its “draconian” and “antiquated” policies – is just doing its job. On the first day of Uber’s recent suspension, motoring journalist James Deakin said on Facebook, “rules are rules.” However, what is illegal is not necessarily bad economics, and what is legal is not necessarily good economics. The letter of the law is no excuse for LTFRB to spawn a flurry of discretionary policies that completely ignore (and even negate) the most basic lessons of economics. To make sure that there are enough rides when people need them, don’t impose caps on surge rates. To make Uber and Grab operations more efficient, don’t impose minimum work hours. To improve the welfare of the riding public, don’t kill a new industry that many people have come to love and depend on. The LTFRB can impose all the orders and decrees it wants, but it cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. Try as it might, it will be as successful as the proverbial king who commanded the waves to retreat. – Rappler.com   The author is a PhD candidate at the UP School of Economics.

Nograles, who represents Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) in the House of Representatives, said Friday, August 18, he tried to use Grab to get to the airport. “To his disappointment, he was refused three times and at least two Grab drivers cancelled on him before one finally decided to take him,” according to a press release from his office. A regular Uber user, Nograles said he eventually cancelled the Grab ride and took a taxi instead. He was still charged by Grab P318 for the ride he did not take. “This to me is a clear case of passenger refusal, which is considered a violation by the LTFRB. They’ve been talking tough about imposing severe punishments against taxi drivers who refuse passengers, but what about those who do the same through our ride-hailing applications? Mas high-tech lang sa Grab, pero di ba pareho lang na passenger refusal ‘yan (Grab is just more high-tech, but isn’t that also passenger refusal)?” said the lawmaker in the statement. Ride-sharing or ride-hailing apps, such as Grab and Uber, have been in the spotlight recently after the LTFRB cracked down on these companies, particularly because they allowed unregistered drivers to use their platforms. The LTFRB recently suspended Uber for a month because the company did not comply with the regulatory agency’s order to stop accrediting and accepting new drivers. Users of the apps have been complaining about the surge in Grab ride prices following the suspension of Uber. Although the two platforms have the same end-goal – connecting a driver to a potential rider – their mechanisms differ. On Uber, for instance, drivers only know the drop-off point after they agree to pick up the passenger. Meanwhile, Grab drivers are informed of a passenger’s destination even before they agree to the trip. Nograles criticized Grab for “overcharging,” which he said “has gone out of control after LTFRB decided to suspend Uber.” “There are times when Grab would charge as much as P800 just for a 20-kilometer ride because of the surge. This is already hold-up. This is no different from a taxi driver who would demand an extra on top of their meter fare. I don’t know if LTFRB even knows this is considered as overcharging,” he said. He called for an “auto-cap” for fare surges. The LTFRB in December 2016 ordered both Grab and Uber to lessen the multipliers for their surge price to twice the fare, excluding the base fare. This was partly in response to the costly surge prices during the holiday season. Nograles said he would bring up the incidences of high surge prices and passenger refusal when the House committee on transport begins tackling bills that would provide legal framework for Grab and Uber to operate in the country. Grab earlier promised to limit to its surge pricing following Uber’s suspension. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/177848-weekly-video-highlights-july-30-august-5-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Videos you need to watch this week, July 30-August 5, 2017","date":"Aug 6, 2017 1:53 PM PHT","snippet":"Must-watch videos from this week","body":"Dear Rappler readers, It is the first week of August, and in the Philippines, the month began with the continuing woes in the Bureau of Customs.

DOTr Assistant Secretary for commuter affairs Elvira Medina raised the issue on Thursday, August 3, in a Senate public services committee hearing. “For the past weeks, the LTFRB had been bashed, they had been maligned. But my question is did any of the two, or any of these TNCs hire agencies using minions and all the other to bash the LTFRB?” Medina asked. However, she was not given the chance to continue her questioning, as Senate committee chair Grace Poe called her out. Poe said it is not wrong for either parties to hire public relations companies in a free market. “Ma’am I think we’re going off topic. I understand what you’re saying. Madaming trolls. Madaming fake news. (There are a lot of trolls. There’s a lot of fake news) That’s the free market. That’s the sad or happy reality. They will get their PR firm. No one’s stopping the LTFRB from getting their own advocates to speak out and that’s fine. No idea will last anyway if it’s untrue,” Poe said. The senator pointed out there must be a bulk of Filipinos who “enjoy” the convenience of TNCs and TNVs. “Obviously, there’s a following and there are people who are agreeing because they absolutely enjoy the service. Otherwise kung propaganda, sandali lang yan (if it’s propaganda, it won’t last). They can spend millions and it will not take off. For sure meron silang (they have) PR, lets just agree on that,” Poe said.

Several lawmakers have filed bills before Congress to define, classify, and regulate companies like Grab and Uber.

Lawyer Bong Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA), told senators that this practice is no different from Uber and Grab’s surge pricing, or the increase in fares based on demand during peak hours. “[Grab and Uber] are trying to incentivize drivers para kapag traffic, may high demand, pupunta ang auto sa pasahero. Because if they don’t do it, hindi susunduin ng mga sasakyan nila ‘yung mga pasahero,” Suntay said during a Senate public services committee hearing on Thursday. (Grab and Uber are trying to incentivize drivers so that during heavy traffic and there’s high demand, they would agree to pick up passengers. Because if they don’t do it, the drivers won’t pick up the passengers.) Suntay explained that some taxi drivers ask for additional payment due to insufficient income or losses incurred in traveling to far or congested areas. “May taxi driver na magsasabi, ‘Puwede ba padagdag ng P50 sa metro?’ Dahil alam ‘nyo ho, pagka ang pasahero magpapahatid sa lugar na matraffic, malulugi ‘yung driver,” he said. (There’s a taxi driver who will say: “Can you add P50 to the metered fare?” Because you know, if a passenger wants to be brought to a congested area, the driver would incur losses.) “If a taxi driver gets stuck in traffic for an hour, the meter would only earn him P75 because our waiting time is P3.50 for every two minutes. A driver who pays a boundary of P1,200 [a day] would need P60 an hour just to make the boundary. This is the reason why taxi drivers ay tumatanggi na maghatid (decline to get passengers),” he added. Suntay also said he is not “justifying” the act, which has exasperated commuters and prompted them to switch to transport network companies (TNCs) like Uber and Grab. “I’m not justifying it. I’m just saying the real reason why it’s done,” he said. Suntay added that the lack of income leads to the negative behavior of drivers. “As with any normal person, income has a direct connection to individual behavior and action. Kapag walang pera, mas bugnutin ka, mas mabilis kang mainis. Kapag maliit ang kita mo, naghahanap ka ng paraan to augment it (If you don’t have money, you’re more irritable, you’re easily annoyed. If you have limited income, you find ways to augment it),” he said.

Here's a rundown of the ongoing controversy","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Over the past couple of days, Filipino commuters took to social media to express their anger and frustration over reports that the operations of Grab and Uber may be adversely affected following a government regulatory body’s crackdown on unregistered drivers using the ride-hailing platforms. The issue sparked fierce debate on both sides – with commuters saying Grab and Uber are essential to metro life and much more reliable than ordinary taxis, while the government insists that these need to be regulated to ensure accountability. What’s the issue about? Here’s a rundown of the ongoing controversy. Who are involved? Ride-hailing services Grab and Uber are considered Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), based on new transport categories created by the government back in May 2015.  Vehicles under Grab, Uber, and other similar ride-sharing services are considered part of the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS). The TNVS covers vehicles that provide pre-arranged transportation services for compensation. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) approved Grab and Uber as TNCs in July 2015 and August 2015, respectively.  The TNCs are required to screen and accredit their drivers and register them with the LTFRB. The LTFRB, meanwhile, is in charge of issuing permits to TNVS drivers: the provisional authority (PA), or a temporary permit valid for 45 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise, which is valid for a year.  What’s the problem? On July 21, 2016, the LTFRB released Memorandum Circular 2016-008, which suspends the acceptance and processing of applications for Uber, Grab, and other ride-sharing services.  The order essentially stopped the release of temporary permits to Grab and Uber vehicles while the LTFRB further studied how to regulate the growing industry. On July 11, 2017 the LTFRB ordered Grab and Uber to pay a fine of P5 million each for letting drivers with no permits or expired permits to still operate on their platforms. Grab and Uber admitted that they accepted new drivers despite the LTFRB’s earlier order, citing strong passenger demand. Both companies said about 80% of their active drivers don’t have a PA or CPC franchise. But some Grab and Uber drivers say it’s not their fault they are considered “colorum.” They point to the LTFRB’s earlier order stopping the processing of TNVS applications. They also claimed that some 7,000 drivers who were already accredited did not get their PAs renewed last year. Because of this, many drivers had expired PAs by the end of 2016.  Aside from the hefty fine, the LTFRB also ordered Grab and Uber to clear out unregistered drivers by July 26 or face more fines.  But Grab and Uber filed separate motions for reconsideration. The LTFRB later agreed not to apprehend unregistered TNVS until it decides on the appeal. While this came as a relief to Grab and Uber users and drivers, this decision did not sit well with operators of taxis, jeeps, and vans: they slammed what they called the LTFRB’s preferential treatment, saying they too should be spared from apprehension while waiting for the approval of their franchise applications.  What’s the LTFRB’s position? For the LTFRB, the problem began with Grab and Uber. LTFRB chief Martin Delgra III said the TNCs may have deliberately withheld telling their “partner drivers” to come to the LTFRB to get a franchise before operating. And despite public outrage on social media, the LTFRB said it’s standing firm on its position, saying the TNCs should explain to their peer operators why they were allowed to operate on the platform even without the proper permits. LTFRB spokesperson Aileen Lizada also said that Uber and Grab trips represent a “minority” in the total number of trips in Metro Manila – they account for only 2% of the 21.5 million trips per day recorded in 2015. But despite this, the LTFRB also acknowledged that the riding public will be harmed if it simply cancels the accreditation of the TNCs. Adding to the controversy were statements made by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, who said that the government should have a share from the income of Grab and Uber. The LTFRB later clarified that Tugade was referring to the unregistered vehicles.  Stoking more reactions was LTFRB’s admission that it lost the accreditation papers of Grab and Uber. The two companies’ accreditations are still pending renewal. Grab’s accreditation expired last July 3, and Uber’s is set to expire in August.    How did the public react? With the LTFRB’s crackdown on unregistered Uber and Grab vehicles, an estimated 15,000 drivers at most can remain on the road, out of the estimated 56,000 drivers. Both Grab and Uber are seeking the support of their users, launching online campaigns. On Twitter, the hashtag #WeWantGrabUber trended as commuters expressed their anger and frustration. Citing bad experiences with taxis, some netizens say Grab and Uber remain the safest way for them to commute. (READ: Cracking down on Uber and Grab will hurt commuters, not protect them)  Even the former LTFRB chief chimed in to say that the new government should listen to actual users of these ride-sharing services.   But some backed the government’s move, citing the need for accountability. During a House hearing, one lawmaker asked whether TNCs can be held accountable if a crash happens involving one of their vehicles.  Others also questioned the surge pricing system that they say needs to be further regulated.  Still, some questioned the very model of Uber and Grab. While its original idea was ride-sharing – those going a certain way can pick up co-passengers heading in the same direction – it quickly became a way to make profit, with some operating them similar to a taxi fleet. (READ: Let us go beyond #WeWantUberGrab)  Because of this, some point to TNVS units as just an addition to traffic, a position the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chief also takes. What’s next? As of Wednesday, July 26, the LTFRB ordered all Grab and Uber drivers who registered with the service after June 30, 2017 to be deactivated.   Grab stopped activating new drivers on July 17, while Uber stopped on July 18. The regulatory agency also said it’s considering setting minimum working hours for Grab and Uber drivers. The LTFRB is continuing meetings with the TNCs. The regulatory agency also plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/176536-grab-new-financing-didi-chuxing-softbank/","title":"Grab to raise $2.5B in new financing","date":"Jul 24, 2017 1:10 PM PHT","snippet":"The Singapore-based firm says it will use the fresh funds to bolster its leading position in the ride-hailing industry and invest in a mobile payment platform called GrabPay","body":" SINGAPORE – Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab said Monday, July 24, it expects to raise $2.5 billion in financing, mostly from China’s Didi Chuxing and Japan’s Softbank, as it strengthens its lead over rival Uber.

Following in the success of the San Francisco-based Uber, the app makes it easy for passengers to hail taxis with just a few taps on their smartphones. The idea for Grab came about following a conversation between co-founder Anthony Tan and an Indonesian friend about the difficulty of hailing taxis in Malaysia. Tan, then a student at Harvard, worked with fellow Malaysian classmate Tan Hooi Ling to create a business plan for what would soon be launched in Malaysia as MyTeksi. The mobile app aimed to connect taxi drivers to passengers efficiently, making it easy for riders to get a ride and for drivers to be assured of their next passenger without aimlessly roaming around the city.

Manila saw the app’s launch in August 2013; it has since expanded to include other Philippine cities such as Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Bacolod, Baguio, and Cagayan de Oro. Aside from booking taxis, the Grab app also offers booking of private cars, a ridesharing carpool service, and a motorcycle delivery service.  2. British India (Malaysia) Established in 1994, British India is a fashion label calling Malaysia – not Britain or India – as its home. It was founded by Pat Liew, who has more than 30 years of experience in the retail industry under her belt. Upon launching, the colonial era-inspired fashion brand had a cheeky tagline: “Presenting British India. An era of racism, oppression, injustice and nice outfits.” Within months since its launch, the brand came out with 4 outlets in Malaysia and 4 in Singapore by the mid-1990s. The Singapore launch, Liew said, was a testbed for the brand’s readiness for a global presence. Since its launch more than 20 years ago, the Malaysian brand has expanded into other countries in Asia, with more than 40 outlets in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.  3. BreadTalk (Singapore) BreadTalk entered the Philippine market in 2004, opening its first branch at Glorietta 4 mall in Makati City and enticing customers with its unique open-plan kitchen that offered a glimpse of how the bread was made. The Singapore-based brand was founded in April 2000, entering Singapore’s bakery industry with products that catered to traditional tastes as well as promoting and creating new varieties of bread. The bakery often has customized product offerings to fit the local flavors or preferences in their outlets in the region. They also launch new products to fit in with seasonal festivals and trends. The company opened its first overseas outlet in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2003. Since then, it has expanded to more than 900 outlets in 17 countries. Its brand portfolio also includes Toast Box, Food Republic, and Ramen Play. It manages the Singapore franchise of the Taiwanese restaurant Din Tai Fung as well.  4. TWG Tea Company (Singapore) Luxury brand TWG Tea (which stands for The Wellbeing Group) was founded by Taha Bouqdib, Maranda Barnes, and Rith Aum-Stievenard in 2008, with Singapore as the launch base of the brand. The famous teashop, which brands itself as an upscale tea salon, offers more than 1,000 fine harvest teas and exclusive blends, as well as a variety of tea patisseries and delicacies. The “1837” in the company’s branding doesn’t refer to the date it was established, but refers to the year when the Chamber of Commerce was founded in Singapore, when the island became a trading post for teas. The luxury brand quickly became well-known worldwide, with its teas being served in some of Singapore’s best hotels and in the front cabins of Singapore Airlines. Food chain Dean & Deluca also brought the brand to US markets, while Harrods brought the brand to London.   5. Potato Corner (Philippines) Known for its flavored french fries, this homegrown brand has been in the industry for 24 years, with more than 500 branches in the Philippines and several more in the US, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Panama. Potato Corner opened its first kiosk outlet back in 1992. Two years since it started business, the brand opened 70 outlets across the country. It opened its first overseas outlet in 2006 in Jakarta, Indonesia, and entered the US market in 2012. By 2016, the brand had 800 stores and had begun operating in Thailand.   6. Jollibee (Philippines) Filipinos love Jollibee. And so does the rest of the world.  The fast food giant behind well-loved food products such as Chicken Joy and Yumburger traces its beginnings to 1975, when Filipino-Chinese founder Tony Tan Caktiong opened an ice cream shop in Cubao, Quezon City. The ice cream shop would later become Jollibee’s first outlet, and would become the bedrock of the company’s rapid expansion for years to come. Jollibee boasts a presence of nearly 978 stores in the Philippines and 80 stores internationally to date. The company also operates other fast food chains including Chowking, Greenwich, Mang Inasal, and Red Ribbon. Jollibee has established an international presence in Canada, the United States, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Brunei, Oman, and Qatar. The group caters not only to Filipinos working overseas but also to locals, who form part of the snaking lines that greet Jollibee’s store openings outside the Philippines. The company withstood the entrance of McDonald’s to the Philippine market in 1981 as it catered to distinct Filipino tastes, setting it apart from the international fast food giant.    7. URC (Philippines) Tracing its beginnings to as early as 1954, Universal Robina Corporation (URC) was started by Filipino businessman John Gokongwei, who learned to do business as a trade importer during World War II and the postwar years. The company started out as a corn mill under the name Universal Corn Products. This business would become the foundation for URC as it is known today – a household name in the snacks industry, agro-industrial operations, and commodities distribution. URC products are distributed under the company’s brands including Jack ‘n Jill, Robina Farms, Robichem, and Universal Corn Products. The company offerings include snacks, beverages, meat and poultry products, and commodities like sugar and flour. URC has expanded beyond the Philippines, distributing its products to countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, China, the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.  8. San Miguel (Philippines) Established in 1890 as La Fabrica de Cerveza de San Miguel, San Miguel is Southeast Asia’s first brewery and the Philippines’ largest brewery to date. The Philippine brand is also part of one of the country’s largest conglomerates: San Miguel Corporation, which has businesses ranging from food, power, oil, and infrastructure to airlines, beverages, and packaging.   San Miguel has been under the control of prominent Filipino families such as the Zobel de Ayalas, Roxases, and Sorianos. It is currently largely owned and operated by Ramon Ang and Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco Jr. The company has manufacturing operations abroad, including in Hong Kong, China, and Australia.  San Miguel exports its beer to major markets around the world and is consistently part of the top 10 bestselling beer brands worldwide. Its brands include Red Horse, Golden Eagle, and the company’s namesake beer products such as household brands San Miguel Pale Pilsen and San Miguel Light.  9. Integrated Micro-Electronics (Philippines) One of the Philippines’ oldest and largest conglomerates, the Ayala group has expanded its presence beyond the country, not only in the region but also globally. The group’s largest international operations is under the company Integrated Micro-Electronics Incorporated (IMI), a leading provider in electronics manufacturing services and power semiconductor assembly and tests services. Established in 1980 as a joint venture between Ayala Corporation and Resins Incorporated, its services cater to a number of industries including telecommunications infrastructure, consumer electronics, solar energy, automotives, medical machines, and storage devices. IMI’s global presence includes manufacturing operations in China, Singapore, the United States, Mexico, Bulgaria, and Czech Republic. The company also has sales operations in Japan and Germany. The company recently marked its entrance into the aerospace industry and defense sector this year with its acquisition of STI Enterprises, a UK-based electronics manufacturing services company.  10. Pilmico Foods Corporation (Philippines) Another Filipino conglomerate, the Aboitiz group, has established an international presence with Pilmico Foods Corporation. Pilmico operates animal farms and also produces and distributes flour and animal feeds. The company was incorporated in 1958 as Central Philippine Milling Corporation by brothers Ramon and Vidal Aboitiz. In 1962, the company partnered with The Pillsbury Company of Minnesota, USA to establish operations in Mindanao. The company changed its name to Pilmico Food Corporation in 1990, upon the sale of all its shares to Aboitiz & Company. The company’s brand profile includes Wooden Spoon flours, Home Style, and Pilmico.  In 2013, Pilmico started exporting its products to the ASEAN market, prompting it to establish operations in Indonesia and Vietnam. At present, Pilmico flour is exported to Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Hong Kong. Its feeds business also currently exports to Cambodia.  11. Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts (Malaysia) Founded by Chinese-Malaysian businessman Robert Kuok, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts opened its first location in April 1971 in Singapore. Inspired by the legendary land found in the novel Lost Horizon by James Hilton, the Shangri-La group draws from the description of the land being an earthly paradise.  The group, now based in Hong Kong, operates 5-star luxury hotels and resorts in several locations and is famous for its world-renowned hospitality and services. According to its company website, the group’s brand portfolio includes Shangri-La, Kerry, and Hotel Jen and Traders branded properties.  Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts has a presence in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North America, and the Indian Ocean islands, with over 40,000 rooms.    12. J.Co Donuts (Indonesia) The popular donut brand finds its roots in Indonesia, where it was established in 2005 by businessman Johnny Andrean. Known for its unique flavor offerings, the company opened its first outlet the same year.  In a little over 10 years, the company now operates over 214 stores in Indonesia and has expanded its presence to other countries including Malaysia, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, and Singapore.  J.Co’s donuts are known for their high quality toppings like matcha green tea, premium dark chocolate, and roasted almonds. The brand is also popular for its playful product names and has expanded into other offerings such as frozen yogurt, beverages, and sandwiches. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/161045-p2p-buses-transport-metro-traffic/","title":"Have you tried the P2P bus yet? It’s still a better ride","date":"Feb 11, 2017 9:30 AM PHT","snippet":"From only 3 routes in end-2015, the P2P service has since expanded its routes. But for its continued success, standards for operators must be maintained.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Between 2015 and 2016, the transportation situation in Metro Manila seemed to be in a perpetual state of crisis: traffic-congested roads were mainstay visuals in daily news, along with the long queues snaking out of train stations. Hardly a week went by without the Metro Rail Transit (MRT3)’s constant breakdowns. With city buses full to the brim and the main thoroughfare EDSA choked with vehicles, frustrated commuters were clamoring for better solutions. The transportation department then tried a tack adapted from Seoul’s successful program that used existing bus infrastructure. In March 2015, the government launched express buses that made only one or two stops along EDSA. By the end of 2015, this expanded into the point-to-point (P2P) bus service, which made no stops at all and promised to shave off 20 to 30 minutes in travel time. (READ: Double decker bus dry run: ‘Preview’ of modern bus system) From only 3 routes in end-2015, the P2P service has since expanded to ferry passengers from the north and south ends of the metro and into the central business districts. Word of mouth and social media buzz piqued the curiosity of commuters willing to pay higher fares – nearly twice as much as ordinary city buses – in exchange for guaranteed seats, premium amenities, and buses that depart on schedule. Insurance broker Vanessa Buendia has ditched the hot and overcrowded MRT in favor of a comfortable air-conditioned seat in the P2P bus she rides from Ortigas Center to her workplace in Makati City. While she admits that the train is still the fastest way to get to her office, queueing up alone already consumes a lot of time. “The MRT is really faster but it’s not comfortable at all…It takes maybe 3 times as long from [getting the ticket] to a ride. But this is really all about the comfort for me,” she said. More riders When the P2P service launched in December 2015, a total of 20 buses ran on only 3 routes, linking Trinoma, SM North EDSA, and SM Megamall to Makati City. Three companies now operate routes from Quezon City and Ortigas Center to Makati City, and from Alabang to Makati City.  When the service first launched, Froehlich Tours had only 15 units for the 2,000 passengers riding their buses every day. Now, they have 48 buses for their 4 routes, and daily ridership has jumped to around 15,000 passengers. HM Transport, which has a partnership with Robinsons Land Corporation, operates two P2P routes from Robinsons Malls in Ortigas and Novaliches. There are a total of 14 units plying the two routes, with about 1,000 passengers riding each route every day. What attracted passengers to try the P2P service? For Froehlich Tours CEO Chris Bauer, the premium amenities not seen in ordinary commuter buses – such as wifi, comfortable seats, and onboard restrooms – may have been the main draw. “In the beginning, people were already happy to have a scheduled service. Then the next step was bringing in a double-decker bus, then a CR, leather seats, PWD functionalities…so expectations are growing whenever we launch the next service,” Bauer said. Aside from the premium bus features, the P2P service’s selling point remains its value to commuters who want a cheaper but relatively fast commute.  Jaime Matias, a former general manager of the Makati Commercial Estate Association, owns a car, but now prefers to ride the P2P bus from Alabang Town Center to Makati. He spends around P1,440 a month by taking bus rides instead of the P4,000 a month he spends in toll fees alone. “Aside from the convenience, it’s less stress since I’m already a senior citizen. I used to drive before, but now I just sit down,” he said. Matias also believes that taking the bus can help ease traffic congestion, pointing out that a bus can transport around 60 passengers and can take the equivalent of about 4 cars off the road. Interconnection, flexibility While the P2P service has expanded and attracted more riders, it’s a challenge for operators to keep up their services as metro traffic continues to worsen, with private cars and ride-hailing services adding to the congestion. “Traffic got worse, unfortunately. The number of private cars is increasing drastically…For sure, you need a certain number of these Uber and Grab vehicles, but what I can see right now, from the perspective of a transport operator, it’s getting too much,” Bauer said. Bauer added that while the Philippines has a lot of transportation options, they don’t interconnect – leaving a large number of vehicles that end up using the same road. “We are lacking this interconnection service. We have great transportation modes in the Philippines, but they don’t work hand in hand. Right now, buses are plying EDSA, [as well as] Uber, Grab, taxis, jeeps. Everybody is plying the same route up and down,” he said. To help bus operators work their way around this problem, Bauer thinks government should allow operators to be more flexible in handling the deployment of their units. Under the current system, franchises are granted based on routes. Operators can’t simply add units to augment an under-supplied route during peak hours, or to pull out under-utilized units during hours with low passenger volume. “Some people tell us we should add more buses on peak hours, but unfortunately our franchise says a maximum of 48 units for the entire routes. Every unit needs to have a special permit and provisional authority,” Bauer said. “For example, if today was a low day, instead of 48 buses I would only need 20, and the other 28 can do something else so I’m not congesting [EDSA]. But I have a franchise for 48 units, so I need to run 48 units every day on EDSA, [regardless] if there are passengers or not,” he added. Transport agencies should also be responsive to changing passenger volume. For HM’s Novaliches route for instance, there seems to be a demand for P2P rides from the Sandiganbayan area. Darwin Renolayan, regional operations manager of Robinsons Land Corporation, raised the possibility of the buses being allowed to make stops in that area to cater to passengers who could not get to the loading terminal. “For Fairview areas, it’s easy for them to go to our loading and unloading points. But how about those nearby areas? A lot of passengers there would also like to ride the P2P, but unfortunately we don’t have loading points there. So we actually requested the [transportation department] to allow us to also load in the Sandiganbayan area, because we feel that there’s a good demand of passengers there,” he said. Bauer, meanwhile, thinks that adding more bus routes is not the way to go for future P2P operations, but to figure out how to plug the gaps in the network. Instead of putting more P2P routes passing along EDSA, he said these routes should simply be interconnected so that passengers would have to transfer to existing buses that already run on the main thoroughfare. But Bauer also acknowledged the difficulties in implementing this plan, pointing out the many laws and agreements between the government and transport operators, and the many business interests that would have to be considered.  Future of P2P With demand increasing, the P2P service looks to be viable in the long run, but Bauer believes this would also largely depend on the operators’ ability to keep the service attractive to passengers. Making sure the buses run on time is a key priority, since this is one of the main reasons why passengers prefer the P2P service over ordinary buses that don’t have a guaranteed departure time. But it’s harder than it sounds, because Froehlich has had instances where some of its drivers arrive late or don’t turn up to work at all. “It’s very hard to find qualified drivers who understand the responsibility they have. They don’t mind if they don’t go to work,” he said. To address this, the company has had to offer incentives to keep drivers punctual. Froehlich Tours’ drivers can earn an additional P600 a day, on top of their regular monthly salary. With salaried drivers, well-maintained buses, and passengers who patronize the rides, the P2P bus service can look enticing to transport operators looking to enter the business. But Bauer thinks that high standards should be maintained to keep the service going. Running P2P buses means more than just branding it as a point-to-point buses; the units themselves must have premium amenities to justify the higher fares and premium bus experience. “P2P is still a great product for the country. If you give operators the freedom that any operator can interbreed P2P on its own way, it will die. So we have to set standards on operators,” he said. – with reports from Addie Pobre and Cathrine Gonzales/Rappler.com Check out the fares and schedules on the P2P buses here: Froehlich Tours, RRCG Transport, HM Transport"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/announcements/159604-commuting-quicker-cheaper/","title":"Commuting made quicker and cheaper","date":"Jan 31, 2017 12:27 PM PHT","snippet":"Save up to P50,000 a year with this carpool app","body":"[Editor’s Note: The following is a press release from Wunder] MANILA, Philippines – The total lifetime cost of owning a car is equal to buying a house or hundreds of holidays.

So how can you do something about those expenses and be a smarter car owner?  Enter the Wunder Carpool app (available on iOS and Android), which launched in Metro Manila last year. It promises office workers who drive their car each day a seamless way to share empty seats and save money. Unlike ride sharing apps such as Uber or Grab, Wunder drivers are not taxi operators and merely pick up passengers on their way to the office or back home, with minimal detour.  After one year of operations in Manila, over 200,000 community members and over a million rides shared, Wunder has learned that drivers who regularly share empty seats with two or three other passengers can earn between P4,000 to P8,000 pesos per month!

Itong lahat maglagay kayo ng mukha ninyo sa likod ng upuan ninyo, your name, a sort of an enlarged identification card,” Duterte said during a one-on-one interview with Rappler’s Maria Ressa in Malacañang on Thursday, December 29. (WATCH: Duterte: The Wartime President)  (From now on, this January, I’ll issue the regulations. All of you put your face at the back of your seat, your name, a sort of an enlarged identification card.) Apparently, reports of abusive drivers have reached the President who had only harsh words should such exploitation of passengers continue. “Kayong mga taxi driver, you better stop it. Kayo, ‘yung Uber pati ‘yung isa, putang ina, ‘yung, ano ‘yung isa? You stop it. You stop it,” he said. (You taxi drivers, you better stop it. You, Uber, even the other one, son of a bitch what’s the other one? You stop it. You stop it.) Drivers who charge more than they should, based on the meter, are committing the crime of estafa or swindling, Duterte added. It’s not clear if the President is aware of the Uber and Grab app features that provide driver information to passengers and even allow passengers to report wrongdoing to app managers. For him, physical identification cards are an easier way for passengers to note down information necessary to pin down crooked drivers. ‘What if I ride your taxi?’ Duterte also wants passengers to report abuses to the Philippine National Police instead of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) since police have the mandate to discipline criminal behavior. “Don’t go to LTFRB. Those agencies have nothing to do with law and order…Disciplining or forcing peope to obey, not to commit crimes, you report directly to the police and the police will have to act on it,” said Duterte. He acknowledged that many taxi drivers supported his presidential bid and that many of them are honest. For dishonest cabbies, he painted a different scenario, with him as their passenger. “Ano kaya kung magsakay ako sa taxi mo, maglabas ako ng sikreto ng Malacañang?

If the traffic proposal is passed, President Rodrigo Duterte will be granted emergency powers to remedy the traffic crisis in Metro Manila and other highly urbanized cities like Cebu.  “We want to be included in the emergency powers of the President, just like Metro Manila and Cebu,” the mayor said in a press statement released Wednesday, October 19. The day before, a public hearing on the traffic crisis in Davao City was held to consult with the transport sector and local officials on whether or not the city should be covered by the proposed Act. The hearing was led by House Transportation Committee Chair Cesar V. Sarmiento and Deputy Speaker Raneo Raine Abu. Committee Vice Chair Cesar Sarmiento, Land Transportation Office (LTO) Assistant Secretary Edgar Galvante, and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chair Martin Delgra were also present during the meeting. Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said previously that Duterte can have emergency powers to deal with the traffic crisis for at most two years.  Traffic in Metro Manila is estimated to be costing the country about P3 billion ($64 million) a day – equivalent to about 0.8% of gross domestic product, previous reports said. Same sentiments Davao City Administrator Zuleika Lopez echoed the appeal of the Davao City mayor.  “With the way urban development is happening in Davao City now, there is an urgent need to complement these with effective measures and traffic mitigation programs,” Lopez said. Lopez also said the city is working on various proposals to remedy the traffic problem in the city. These include management of the volume of car ownership, congestion management, elevated tollways, mass transport system, walkways, bikeways, and multi-level parking facilities. Jose Thor Villarreiz, Davao City manager of taxi service Grab, agreed that emergency powers should include Davao City. “If it could mean the fast implementation of projects and programs that would improve roads and ease traffic congestion, then I think it is worthy of support,” he said.

A. Barata. In response to the order of government, Grab’s Indonesian unit said it was already working with a local Indonesian partner. “Grab is now trying to ensure that our partner can and will follow every requirement from the government,” said Ridzki Kramadibrata, managing director of Grab Indonesia.  There was no immediate comment from Uber. Ride-hailing apps are being blamed by taxi drivers for dwindling their income. Thousands of taxi drivers gathered in Jakarta to express their anger on Tuesday, a protest that escalated quickly and turned violent.  Once incident involved protesters attempting to rip off the jacket of an ojek or motorcycle driver, while another involved taxi drivers taking an ojek driver’s helmet and tossing it.

Free ride A day after the protests, Blue Bird taxi company provided free service for 24 hours in an attempt to restore its image following violent protests involving some of its drivers. “The meter runs but I don’t have to pay,” Stuart Burney from Australia said in Jakarta after taking Blue Bird taxi on Wednesday, March 23. “Taking a free ride offered by the taxi company is pretty good.” Burney was one of the lucky ones since many people found it difficult to hail or order a Blue Bird cab on Wednesday. Netizens also complained about the supposed lack of taxis on Twitter, saying there was no point of it being free. Some Jakartans also expressed fear of taking a Blue Bird. “I am afraid to take Blue Bird taxis even if it offers us a free ride, after seeing drivers attack ojek riders on TV,” Daboe, a commuter in Jakarta, said to Rappler. New apps like Go-Jek have also allowed commuters to hail rides with motorcycles. She also worried that ojek riders might be vengeful towards taxis.

Instead of their jackets that showed off their companies, they wore their own shirts instead.  “I don’t want to wear my Grab jacket today,” Igun, a rider working for Grab Taxi said. “The taxi drivers attacked my co-workers,” he added.

Keadilan bagi seluruh penyedia jasa transportasi Shafruhan memuji keputusan pemerintah yang akhirnya memberikan badan hukum bagi Grab Car dan Uber, yakni koperasi. Namun, hal tersebut masih belum cukup. Masih ada sejumlah masalah lain yang harus diselesaikan. Selain masalah pelat, ada pula standar penetapan tarif dan izin pengelolaan. Shafruhan menilai Uber dan Grab telah menginjak-injak pemerintah dan UU dengan cara menetapkan tarif yang semena-mena. “Dia harus memperoleh izin pengelolaan angkutan umum dari pemerintah, seperti perusahaan taksi ataupun mobil rental. Kan semuanya sudah diatur, termasuk tariff juga dari pemerintah,” kata dia. Selain itu, mobil-mobil yang beroperasi di bawah naungan Uber dan Grab juga harus sudah melalui uji kir. “Kalau mereka (Uber dan Grab) seenaknya sendiri seperti ini, kan artinya sama dengan telah menampar pemerintah. UU kan yang buat pemerintah juga, kok dilanggar,” kata Shafruhan. Ia berharap unjuk rasa besok merupakan yang terakhir, dan pemerintah bisa segera mengambil keputusan yang adil bagi kedua belah pihak.  Menurut dia, para supir sudah mengikhlaskan waktu kerja dan penghasilan mereka dalam sehari untuk menuntut keadilan. “Kalau belum tuntas juga, kami belum tahu akan mengambil langkah apa lagi,” kata dia. Pastikan unjuk rasa damai dan bebas penyusup Shafruhan mengimbau agar unjuk rasa kali ini tetap berjalan dengan damai tanpa ada tindak kekerasan. Besok, ia memperkirakan ada 20 ribu orang yang akan mengikuti unjuk rasa dari seluruh pelosok Jakarta. “Sudah saya ingatkan agar menggunakan atribut penanda. Tujuannya menghindari provokasi dari penyusup,” kata dia. Atribut dapat berupa seragam, atau penanda kain hitam di lengan kiri seperti sebelumnya. Unjuk rasa pada pekan lalu memang menelan korban satu unit kendaraan Grab Car, yang dihancurkan salah satu kelompok demonstran. Namun, Shafruhan mengatakan belum tentu pelakunya anggota PPAD. “Bisa saja ada penyusup yang mau provokasi. Pokoknya sudah saya imbau supaya jangan terbawa emosi,” kata dia. Aksi besok masih akan memakai rute yang sama dengan sebelumnya. Dari pelbagai titik di Jakarta, massa akan bergerak menuju dua titik, yakni gedung Dewan Perwakilan Rayat dan Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika. Demonstrasi sendiri akan berlangsung mulai pukul 9 pagi hingga pukul 17.30. Untuk itu, armada Go-Jek, Grab Bike, Car, Taxi, dan Uber diimbau untuk tak melewati area tersebut. -Rappler.com BACA JUGA:                            "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/123610-uber-bangkok-motorbike-service/","title":"Uber launches motorbike service in Bangkok","date":"Feb 24, 2016 11:00 PM PHT","snippet":"If successful, Uber is also open to bringing UberMOTO to other cities like Manila and Jakarta","body":" BANGKOK, Thailand – Uber offered its first motorbike taxi service on Wednesday, February 24, launching a pilot scheme in Bangkok which could spread across Asia as it takes on chief regional rival Grab. Motorbikes have long been a popular commuting option in the Thai capital, which has horrendous traffic jams due to increased car ownership and poor city planning.  Ubiquitous motorbike taxi drivers, found at stands across the city wearing bright orange jackets, weave in and out of stalled traffic with both skill and knuckle-whitening speed. An Uber motorbike which collects passengers from their office or home could prove popular with commuters.  But UberMOTO will be up against both Singapore-based Grab, which began offering a Bangkok motorbike service alongside its cabs last year, and the tens of thousands of regular motorbike taxi drivers who jealously guard their patches. “I’m really excited to say Thailand is the first country to launch a two-wheeled motorcycle product in all of our cities,” Douglas Ma, Uber’s head of Asia expansion, told reporters. The US company has become one of the world’s most valuable startups, worth an estimated $50 billion and with a presence in 68 countries.  But it has faced regulatory hurdles and protests from established taxi operators in most locations where it has launched. Both Uber and Grab Taxi have shaken up the taxi industry in Bangkok, providing an alternative to the capital’s often mercurial cabbies who routinely decline fares or refuse to use their meters. The company will initially roll out the bikes in 3 commercial districts and said the fares should be cheaper than regular motorbike taxis. Uber will focus on Thailand but does not rule out launching similar services in other traffic-clogged Asian megacities like Jakarta and Manila. “This is the first time we’re doing it in any market in the world, so our hope is to develop it and innovate it,” Ma told AFP.  “If it makes sense, absolutely we want to look at other markets.” Ma declined to say how many motorbike drivers the company had already signed up but said it was in the thousands. At a stand in the commercial district of Chidlom, motorbike taxi driver Winai Bunprueng said he was unlikely to join up. “If I joined the app and I refused to go, they would reprimand or sack me – but for me now, if I can’t agree with passengers on the prices, I won’t go,” the 37-year-old told AFP. Chalerm Changthongmadan, head of the Association of Taxi Motorcyclists of Thailand, said he was concerned by the arrival of start-up competitors. “I think it will bring conflict among people who do these jobs,” he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/120582-grabtaxi-rebranding-grab-regional-app/","title":"GrabTaxi rebrands as Grab, eyes further expansion","date":"Jan 28, 2016 7:55 PM PHT","snippet":"The app company's goals go far beyond taxi-hailing","body":" SINGAPORE, Singapore – With Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing boom, Grab, formerly known as GrabTaxi, has evolved with strategic rebranding and a growing platform of on-demand services. In a regional launch in Singapore on Thursday, January 28, GrabTaxi rebranded itself as Grab to reflect its new range of services. Its new company name says that it no longer only offers pre-arranged taxi rides – the service it started out in 2012. (READ: GrabTaxi PH launches GrabPay, GrabHeli) The new Grab encompasses all its services: taxis (GrabTaxi), private car services (GrabCar), motorcycles (GrabBike), social carpooling (GrabHitch), and last mile delivery (GrabExpress), under one umbrella brand.  “We’ve grown over the years – and we’re now much more than a taxi app. This new brand is an important evolution that represents our goal to outserve our customers,” Grab Group CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan said during the regional launch. Dominance in Southeast Asia Since its establishment in 2012, Grab has evolved from a taxi-booking application to Southeast Asia’s largest land transport company.  Grab now has over 200,000 drivers and more than 11 million mobile downloads. (READ: Could this be GrabBike’s last ride in the Philippines?) The company’s data show that in mid-2015, it experienced 35% average monthly growth in GrabCar rides and a 75% average monthly growth in GrabBike rides across the region. These figures are encouraging as Grab aims to move far ahead of other ride-hailing companies like Uber. (READ: Uber plans APEC region expansion despite rough ride) “We have set the benchmark in the industry, with the most number of transport services that cater to all price points, all available in one app,” Tan said. Grab’s CEO said his company will “grow from the current 28 cities across 6 Southeast Asian countries,” but did not specify where.  “What I can say is we are focusing all our energy in providing better transport services in the region,” Tan said. Grab’s regional focus allows the company to navigate the Southeast Asian terrain smoothly, helping the firm to win over traditional taxi companies. Tan said when it comes to profit, “Grab will sustain the growth in 2016 and continue shooting for the sky.” Beefed up services With its new branding, Grab has also beefed up its smartphone app with more user-friendly features, including personalized pickup and dropoff locations, GrabPay mobile wallet, and GrabWork. GrabPay allows passengers to go cashless, either via credit or debit cards.  GrabWork, meanwhile, is aimed at business professionals who can now tag their rides and track receipts easily for expense claims purposes. According to Tan, their company is also investing in engineering centers, with one each in the United States, Beijing, China, and Singapore.   On a ‘friendlier’ road To help win the Southeast Asian market, Grab VP for Marketing Cheryl Goh said her company is taking a friendlier road than its rivals. While some of Grab’s rivals have developed a reputation for being combative, Goh said they are leaning towards a “more open and collaborative working environment” with regulators. In the Philippines, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday ordered Grab to cease operations of GrabBike until proper guidelines are promulgated. “We’re not going to fight the government. We will, instead, discuss with them how to go about it. I think all of us have the same end-goal: Provide better transport for the commuters. It’s not all about profit,” Goh said. While Uber hurdles legal battles in Germany and the United States, among others, GrabTaxi has avoided disputes with transport regulators to “provide as many public transportation options to commuters as possible,” Goh added. According to Goh, Grab’s end-goal is to influence people to make ride-hailing a daily habit. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/lifestyle-and-entertainment/109906-aftermath-masskara-invasion-2015/","title":"The aftermath of the Masskara Invasion 2015","date":"Oct 19, 2015 10:34 PM PHT","snippet":"Here's a recap of what happened during the biggest Masskara celebration in Bacolod City","body":"BACOLOD CITY, Philippines – Last Saturday, October 17, the Masskara Invasion in Bacolod City brought in thousands of party goers at the Invasion Grounds at 20th Lacson Street.

Layanan online dengan aplikasi yang dikembangkan Pemerintah Kota Bandung ini, kata Emil, bisa memfasilitasi pesanan ojek dari penumpang kapan dan di mana saja, bahkan bisa juga melakukan layanan pesan antar barang atau makanan. Sementara biasanya, oiek tradisional hanya menunggu penumpang di pangkalan. “Saya lagi meminta ke tim IT di Command Center untuk mulai membuat konsep apps (aplikasi) ojek pangkalan sehingga siapapun bisa menggunakan itu tanpa harus dikelola oleh perusahaan seperti Go-Jek,” kata Emil di Balai Kota Bandung, Selasa, 8 September. Konsep yang hampir sama dengan Go-Jek ini diharapkan oleh Emil dapat meningkatkan kesejahteraan pengendara ojek sebab akan mendapatkan penumpang kapan saja dan di mana saja.  Sebelum aplikasi itu ada, Emil meminta para pengendara ojek untuk meningkatkan daya tariknya. Caranya dengan melayani pemesanan dengan menggunakan handphone, misalnya dengan layanan pesan singkat dalam memesan ojek.  Emil menilai, kebutuhan masyarakat akan ojek di Indonesia tidak dapat dikesampingkan bahkan keberadaannya sangat membantu masyarakat karena transportasi massal di Bandung, umumnya Indonesia, masih perlu ditingkatkan. Berbeda dengan negara maju yang sudah punya transportasi massal yang cukup baik. “Saya mendukung sebelum ada transportasi publik yang memadai. Di negeri-negeri yang sudah maju tidak ada ojek karena transportasinya sudah memadai,” ucapnya. Sebelumnya, pada pekan ini pula Emil melarang layanan taksi berbasis aplikasi — Uber dan Grab Taxi — beroperasi di Bandung. Menurutnya, kedua layanan tersebut hingga kini belum menyelesaikan legalitas formal sebagaimana diatur dalam undang-undang tentang sistem transportasi umum di Indonesia.  Sementara itu di Jakarta, layanan Go-Jek mendapat kecaman yang datang dari para pengemudi ojek tradisional yang mangkal di jalan.  Di lain pihak, Pemerintah Provinsi DKI Jakarta menyambut Go-Jek dan akan menjalin kerjasama dalam bentuk aplikasi yang terintegrasi dengan penyedia layanan bus TransJakarta. —Rappler.com BACA JUGA:"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/105269-grab-taxi-car-abuse-commuters-rights/","title":"Are Grab drivers abusing commuters’ rights?","date":"Sep 9, 2015 3:02 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) GrabTaxi and GrabCar resort to prohibited practices: asking for tips, and refusal to convey due to the intended destination of the commuter, says a former MMDA official","body":" MANILA, Philippines – (UPDATED) Thousands of commuters were stranded on Tuesday night, September 8, after a downpour caused floods in parts of Metro Manila. Along the capital’s major roads, like EDSA and Taft Avenue, people started walking home due to the lack of available public transportation. Those with vehicles endured hours on the road due to bottlenecks. (READ: Palace: MMDA ordered to manage heavy traffic Tuesday night) Netizens took to social media to vent their frustration on the traffic situation. Among the posts that made rounds on the Internet were from frustrated GrabTaxi and GrabCar users, who pointed out how the app-based transport services added to their frustration.  On Facebook, former Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) “traffic czar” Yves Gonzalez posted about the case of a student who was waiting for a GrabCar driver to accept her offer. The driver, it turned out, was just beside her, ignoring her all along. “The experience of this girl (posted on Jason Cruz’s thread) would be funny if only it wasn’t the most perfect example of what’s obviously wrong with GrabTaxi/Car’s current booking system, which gives choosy drivers total control over the hapless commuter,” Gonzalez said. While GrabTaxi markets itself as an alternative from abusive taxi drivers, Gonzalez noted that the app instead is being used by drivers to exploit commuters. “The current booking system of Grab (the company) unduly promotes the interests of the peers (both driver and operator) to the detriment of the rider or commuter. It has institutionalized two prohibited principles in taxi-type common carriers: asking for additional payment on top of the stated fare, and refusal to convey due to the intended destination of the commuter,” Gonzalez told Rappler. GrabTaxi is a mobile application, founded in Malaysia in 2011, that allows users to book taxis. GrabCar is the app’s alternative form of service which uses cars through licensed partners, in case there are no available taxis during rush hour.  Institutionalizing bribery? According to Gonzalez, the current “tip” system is nothing more but a bribe for the driver to accept a trip. This, plus the thousands of hours and pesos lost in the platform is not in the best interest of the commuter. “Pesos are lost as the current mentality of a lot of the drivers is to wait for a big fat ‘tip’ to be inputted by the rider, who out of desperation to get a ride will succumb to the broken system and offer this ‘tip.’ The system has made a mockery of the traditional definition of a tip, which is something given after a job or service is well rendered,” he said. The current set-up, he added, puts commuters in a helpless state, forced to resort to bribing Grab drivers. “Commuters also have no resort when no driver wants to accept their trip, even if there are hundreds of peer vehicles claimed to be ‘available’ in his/her area. An intended trip can be offered to hundreds of peer drivers, and not one of them will accept it without a big fat ‘tip’ attached to the offer,” Gonzalez said.  While the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulating Board (LTFRB) or MMDA can apprehend taxis that ask for more payment, Grab just made the “broken system” part of the process, Gonzalez maintained.

Myles Delfin, a designer and entrepreneur, wrote: Every single day, the problem of the commuting public is that taxis, jeepneys, and buses are so badly regulated that commuters are left at the mercy of whoever is behind the wheel, and now the LTFRB is going after the only reliable form of transportation available to the Filipino? I think, the people who lead this agency should try standing in line at any of the taxi stands in a shopping mall on a payday Friday – and every day thereafter, just to let them feel what it’s like to be on the receiving end of nonsense. They’re forgetting that it’s not only about the law, their job, if they decide to take it seriously, is to make sure that the Filipino gets the service they deserve. The reality of the situation is that it is time for public transportation to evolve because it doesn’t work and the government agency tasked to make it work has consistently failed. Independent innovators like Uber and GrabTaxi wouldn’t have any business if public transport actually worked, and the LTFRB has had decades to find a solution and make it work, and now they want us to entrust our safety, peace of mind, and time to an idea that is basically a knock-off of the service they’re trying to pin down. For what reason? The law? Regular taxi drivers mock the law every minute of the day whenever they disregard the regulations that are in place to make sure the riding public aren’t abused or taken advantage of, everybody knows this from experience, and where is the official concern there? Taxi drivers at the airport virtually try to rob people blind whenever they step out of the arrival terminal, isn’t that about the law too? Jeepneys cause traffic whenever they pick up and unload passengers at all the wrong places, why isn’t that a priority? Others shared some of their experiences on the road. Judy Marie Santiago, a communications officer, said: One time, I can’t find a cab on Grabtaxi and got desperate. Buses are jampacked, MRT queues are hopeless. I had to give a tip of 100 just to get one.  Hep Benitez, an author and teacher, commented: I always have to pay an additional 50 pesos or 100 pesos on top of the metered bill just to get a taxi. Edna Ledesma-Javier complained about the flagdown rate: Isn’t it that the flag down was already reduced to Php30? The first week it was announced all the taxis had this placard in front that says flag down is less than 10 pesos. Now, they do not have it. And when you ask for it they feigned innocence. Jordan Zamoranos shared his picture of a taxi driver who allegedly refused to take him from Ortigas to Glorietta.  Kaizel Sarabia said: Everytime we went to the Malate area and ride a cab from there to my house, we always encounter cab drivers like that. Mostly, they demand 100 percent increase in fare. James Habitan shared his experience:  The taxi driver asked for a deposit for 100 pesos so he could get me to ATC faster. Immediately, I know I was going to get ripped off so I threatened to leave the taxi to find myself a new one unless he charges me by the meter. Sure enough, as soon as I opened the door, the driver gave in to my conditions and turned his meter on. We got to ATC right away and I was only charged just under Php70.00. Dheejhae Flores urged LTFRB to be responsive on social media: Sana may Facebook Page din ang LTFRB na sumasagot gaya ng MMDA. May Twitter nga sila, never naman sumasagot.” Redi Briones reported many times to the LTO hotline after a UV express driver shouted at him for not having the exact fare. He wonders what happened to those cases with special codes.

I’d say it’s a win-win. Taxis get the bookings, plus they get to pick the passengers they want (since they do this anyway).  Albert Paul Navarro made this proposal: There should be an incentive in place to encourage carpools coming from LTO because it only does not lessen the cars on the road but it lessens carbon emissions as well. Taxis are threatened by Grab and Uber because of the quality of service those brands provide so it’s high time taxis should also reinvent the wheel. Why would the commuting public go for Uber and Grab if their services are as good as these brands? Quality of the vehicle is also in question. Uber and Grab utilize private cars that are well maintained and taken care of by the owners while Taxis are the exact opposite,” observed  Raymond Lam Ko, on the other hand, suggested: Fix the transportation system so people wouldn’t rely on taxis and uber like app services. Fix and expand the train system, fix or update the bus system, fix the taxi drivers and units, update jeepneys to non smoke belching if not to phase them out, tricycles can be maintained for small streets only or in subdivisions. But IMHO, if trains are fixed, traffic will lessen because more people will take the train rather than taxi. This was echoed by Gene Angelo Ferrer, National Coordinator of Aksyon Klima.

De La Salle’s Project of Asian and International Relations (DLSPAIR) will kick off the 2015 Harvard – Asia conference on August 20 in the Shangri-La Hotel, Makati after a 21-year absence. This year’s theme is “Confronting Asia’s Development Challenges through innovation.”  Every year, the Harvard Project of Asian and International Relations (HPAIR) holds two academic conferences, one in Harvard itself which is held every February, and one in Asia, which is held every August.   Since 1991, Harvard has been bringing together students from all over the world and leaders in the fields of Academics, Business, Health, Finance, Diplomacy, Security and many more. Together they look to fulfill the conference’s 3 goals:  During the 5-day conference the students are exposed to various issues related to politics, economics, culture and business.  This year, DLSU-Manila was chosen to be the partner university. “We want to redefine HPAIR’s standards and bring the conference closer to the issues and problems discussed throughout the conference” said Jonathan Beltran, Executive Director of DLSPAIR.  “We also reinvented the conference experience through increased participation of sponsors and companies throughout the Philippines,” Beltran added.   BDO and The Ayala Corporation will have company sponsored case studies, wherein representatives from the company are present to personally explain the cases. This will be done for the first time in this year’s Asia Conference. The conference will consist of 7 different panels and their corresponding themes: The conference will include special events like International Night, Manila Night, Entertainment Night, field trips and mixers for delegates and speakers.  This year’s HPAIR-Asia Conference will be held at The Makati Shangri-La from August 20 – 24, 2015.  “MANILA2015,” in partnership with Banco De Oro, would not be possible without our academic partners, De La Salle University and Asian Institute Management, our sponsors, Ayala Corporation, Philippine Airlines, RFM Foods Corporation, Grab Taxi, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, Globe Telecom, Phinma, Go Negosyo, and Security Bank, and our official media sponsors, Rappler, When In Manila, ANC, Animo Magazine, RX 93.1 and Magic 89.9.” – Rappler.com For more information, you may visit its official website. "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/99743-job-interview-travel-gap-year-career/","title":"How to handle a job interview after a gap year of travel","date":"Jul 19, 2015 3:47 PM PHT","snippet":"Considering a year off? How will you address that when it's time to look for a job? Traveler Mark Villaflor shares 10 things he's learned living life on the road","body":" While 98% of our friends are at work Monday through Friday, we’re on the other side of the world in Colombia in South America doing a work exchange. We’re at the end of our 365 travel dates currently on date #341, sitting poolside at a former drug lord’s mansion turned boutique hotel. (READ: A year-long honeymoon: One traveling couple’s adventure) But because we’ve made a conscious decision to try and extend this trip we’ve decided to become entrepreneurial backpackers. We’ve decided to forego our careers (with the possibility of leaving even that behind) to continue traveling. (READ: Move slow, move local: A story of how we travel) However, shall we ever need to interview, we’ve got explanations for our “gap” in resume. We’ve traded in new skills learned on the journey such as blogging, travel writing, social media management, translation work, and marketing for food, housing, and tours. We’ve hustled our way into free flights and we’ve done many things for small businesses and various individuals through a system of exchange called bartering where money wasn’t involved. The greatest thing we’ve been able to do for others is move with love and provide value. If you’re doing those two things, people will move with and for you. With the abundance of volunteer opportunities, work exchange, and jobs abroad, you can actually “work” and travel at the same time. We’ve worked-exchanged our way through various places and done jobs we were never “qualified” for, or so we thought. In the last year, we’ve learned some Swahili, a ton of Spanish, and various cultures’ etiquette. We’ve worked with foreign tongues in exotic locations while learning hotel management. So what are employers looking for these days? Experience, teamwork, communication skills, marketing, cultural diversity in the work space, adaptability, the ability to work independently and collaboratively in high stress situations, and emotional intelligence. Travel can teach you all those and more. Here’s our rundown of translated skills: Communication. Travel is contagious in magnifying all human emotions and giving you indescribable stories. You hear, learn, and speak foreign tongues. In non-verbal cues, we’ve found ways to communicate more creatively. Understanding is important. We’ve learned to get our message across more clearly.  Negotiation. When strolling souks, artisan markets, and wet markets, we’ve learned a lot about negotiation. For example, you realize the price you’re getting quoted compared to that of the local standing next to you is completely outrageous. You’ll have to learn to start low enough so you have wiggle room, and master how to display specific gestures and body language to encourage your counterpart to lower their prices.  Of course in the game of bargaining there are often those who play hardball. During all this, we’ve learned to keep calm, understand this cultural dance, and walk away from the situation with a win-win result. Adaptability. A mosquito bit you, infecting you with dengue, the bus you were supposed to catch is at a different terminal in a dangerous part of the city, your limited Spanish is barely getting you to where you need to go, and you’ve got 17 minutes to grab a taxi and catch the overnight bus. You take yourself, your wife, and a Dutch couple who speak no Spanish and make your way to the bus terminal only to have to do a quick sprint to the your particular bus that’s leaving. This happened to us. Lost, tired, hungry, sick and in the middle of thousands of other people in transit, we figured out how to adapt to the stress that travel often throws at you. What specific stressor is the interviewer even asking about? You’ve got the whole idea of working in a stressful environment down, it’s called backpacking. Organization. If you’ve ever packed in 3 countries, 5 cities, and 8 different hotels and toured for a two-week span or longer, you know the importance of organization and planning. Not to mention the need to have specific details in order, from bus times, transfers to the correct airport, compiling visa and passport documents and don’t forget those times changes. The complexity of organization only gets more tedious when you’re on African time and or have to deal with specific cultural aspects and etiquette. This was all without wifi, a working phone number, and in a different language. Of course sometimes, you’ll need help – which leads us to… Collaboration. Unless you stayed in your hostel bed the entire time, you’ll move around a lot, for example, planning on ways to save on that trip, or figuring out how to opt out of other expensive tours and go for DIY tours instead. In the process you’ll have to speak to other travelers about their knowledge of the area and then perhaps speak to the hotel staff. We had to do this before, and in the end we saved $14 dollars, spent two extra hours in transit, and had the best lunch at a roadside restaurant (not on Tripadvisor) all as a result of some collaborating. We’ve learned how to ask and receive gracefully.  Confidence. When you first set out, you probably went out with your heavy backpack full of enthusiasm and perhaps some anxiety, moving into the unknown.  Then you realized your overconfidence was ignorant and fell more than you ever have. But in your times of failure and trying new things you found yourself stepping up. You’re moving confidently in your courage while overcoming what fears you’ve been encountering. For example, our acquisition of French-speaking skills while touring the region and its colonial countries in Africa gave us increased confidence in our ability to be understood and move through foreign lands.  Increased aspirations. Because we went on the road leaving all our possessions behind, we’ve become more open to the endless possibilities life has to offer. We’ve increased our aspirations for ourselves and for this world. Post-travel, we have plans on opening up or contributing to a child’s education fund, providing solutions to water supply issues in arid regions, advocating for indigenous rights, or starting our own eco-conscious lodge. We’ve seen more of the world’s global operations and strengthened our own drive and confidence on how to build solutions for future generations. Interpersonal skills. My experiences with the Masai men, Mayan women, and even my own wife on a 24-hour train ride tested my people skills.  One’s ability to relate to people, create new relationships and communicate with a diverse group of people has surely been tested on the road, and one’s increased interpersonal intelligence and people skills will be shown wherever the next office cubicle awaits. Developing intrapersonal and emotional intelligence. While we were on that 24-hour ride with that spitting and smoking Chinese guy seated next to us, I sought refuge looking out at foreign landscapes trying to reflect and understand our circumstances. During those times, I journaled, and thought about my ability to relate to this world where I was full of privilege. I sat in front of abject poverty and wrestled in my mind about the injustices of this world and my place in it.  In the end, I learned empathy and touched upon my emotional intelligence, learning not to react but to understand. My deepest thoughts and reflections were also revealed after a few days in the wilderness, hiking. I jotted those thoughts down, started that blog, and reflected on life and its meaning, and that’s translated into a deeper understanding of who I am and who I want to be. Global-mindedness. Given the huge boost in technology tearing down physical barriers and globalization expanding at a rapid pace, an understanding of global economics and international relations is key. We’ve traveled in pesos, dollars, shillings, and have been millionaires in various countries, understanding the effects of global recession, inflation, unemployment, politics, and terrible economic policies mixed together. So now that we’ve left our own comforts, we’ve realized that the world is more diverse that we expected. We’ve become more aware of the impact that the “developed” world has on “third world” countries and are beginning to understand what it means to be eco-conscious. These of course are all good for ethical business practices. Just because you’re traveling doesn’t mean you’re not working or self-improving. In travel you are able to continually make mistakes and create footprints towards a better you.  You’re put into difficult situations sometimes by choice often times not. Traveling gives you the ability to display courage in the face of adversity. It shows you who you are and who you can be. It gives you stories to tell and ways to intertwine those stories in future job interviews. These experiences directly translate into working skills, and more importantly, life skills. It gives you real life experience and an active education to complement the theories you learned in school, and gives you the opportunity to shed and unlearn incorrect assumptions of how this world truly works. Investment in travel is investment in one’s self, if that’s the path you choose to take. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/90859-earth-day-jam-2015/","title":"All set for Earth Day Jam 2015","date":"Apr 23, 2015 11:21 AM PHT","snippet":"The country's biggest and longest running concert event returns this April in Bonifacio Global City","body":"MANILA, Philippines – On April 24, the intersection of 9th Ave. and 34th St. in Bonifacio Global City will make way for the biggest and longest running musical event of its kind – EARTH DAY JAM.

After saying on Twitter that he had a big announcement to make, Manuel “Manny” V. Pangilinan, chairman of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) declared on Friday, September 26, that prepaid subscribers of Smart, Talk N’ Text, and Sun Cellular can now avail of mobile Internet services offered by the 3 networks – for free. “That’s better than politics,” Pangilinan quipped, referring to speculations that his announcement would be on his reported decision to run in the 2016 elections. Pangilinan said this is an initiative to make mobile Internet available for all, adding that his company’s  wireless group has been spending P150 billion ($3.35 billion*) in capital expenditure to improve and democratize mobile Internet services in the country. “We are launching this initiative to provide a much larger number of Filipinos the opportunity to try out and experience the Internet, enjoy its benefits and, as we at Smart like to say, ‘live more,’” Pangilinan said. Napoleon Nazareno, PLDT president and chief executive officer, said: “Only one-third is using the Internet. That is the objective, to get them into the Internet. This is the opportunity we are looking at, trying to democratize data.” To date, Smart, Talk N’Text, and Sun Cellular have a combined total subscribers of 66 million. Nazareno estimates that about 20 million of these subscribers have smartphones, and 14 to 15 million of them are already using mobile Internet. The free yet finite data usage starts today, September 26, and will run until November 30. Subscribers can use data up to 30MB a day. They need to have a minimum of P1 ($0.22)  to avail of the offer. Nazareno said there might be forgone revenues in the process, but they are banking on the decreasing cost of data-capable phones to attract more people to use the services available on mobile Internet. Pre-paid subscribers of the 3 mobile networks can now search Google, Wikipedia; use Google Maps and Waze for navigation; shop on Amazon, eBay, Lazada, Zalora; browse Instagram; and reserve taxi via Grab Taxi or Easy Taxi.  They can also listen to songs via Smart’s Spinnr music; book their trips via Expedia and Skyscanner; send, and receive emails, either through data-capable feature phones or smartphones running on Google Android, Apple iOS, and Microsoft Windows Phone OS. Smart also said users have a daily 30MB stipend for the free Internet they will be getting. This excludes VOIP and messaging apps like Viber and Whatsapp, as well as video streaming websites. Peer-to-peer file sharing is likewise not a part of this free Internet offer. The speed of the connection is going to be limited by the device or handset being used by the subscriber. Location, time of use, and the type of connectivity they can get – 2G, 3G, or 4G – will also be limiting factors. The minimum speed, however, is set to 12 kilobits per second (kbps). Active Smart prepaid subscribers can take advantage of the promotion by texting FREE to 9999. To get free Internet daily, they must text the number daily to continue free access. Globe Telecom revives free Facebook offer Pangilinan’s announcement intensified the war between telecommunications giants Smart and Globe. At 7:08 pm September 26, Globe tweeted and posted on its Instagram account that it is reviving its free Facebook offer starting week of September 28. Further details to follow, the firm announced.  Hours after Pangilinan’s announcement, rival telecommunications company Globe telecom released a statement saying it is “flattered and honored” that their competitors are following their lead. In a statement, the Ayala-led firm reminded that they were the first to roll out free Internet services like Facebook from October 2013 to April 2014. Globe added that in the end, the customers will choose the telecommunications provider with the best digital services and the fastest experience possible. “Amid all the hype and promotions, we are happy in the fact that, at Globe, we deliver both.…We look forward to more vigorous competition to come! Stay tuned,” Globe said. – with reports from Mick Basa, Lynda C.

Xiamen is a city located at the southeast coast of the People’s Republic of China with a population of a little over 3.5 million. I was looking forward to getting lost in all of it, the culture, the history and the romance.    And lost we were. Xiamen is an urban sub-provincial city, and many people there barely speak English. It might be good to pack a standard English – Mandarin Chinese dictionary or better yet, bring someone who knows the language. But if you don’t mind getting lost in the adventure and finding your way through happy games of charades along the way, Xiamen is for you. Cleanliness is next to Godliness As soon as you arrive at Xiamen International Airport, something odd stands out – it’s so clean. Grabbing a taxi to our hotel, we passed thru the streets, tunnels, windows open and wind against our faces. Xiamen is one of the cleanest places I’ve ever seen. Surprisingly, our room at the Bestel Hotel Xiamen was huge with an amazing bathroom and lounge area. A big plus was that we were right smack in the middle of the city’s shopping and food district. The weather was just like Manila, wet and humid. Pack an umbrella, as we had to buy during the trip. We also had to schedule our activities around the fickle weather and relied on how the sky looked in the morning. On our first day, we decided to explore our surroundings; closest was the Zongshan Lu Pedestrian Road. This walking district has a long history of east-west architecture and consists of row after row of shopping centers, small retail stores and specialty food stalls that sell fun finds like different flavors of Hopia (apple the strangest for me) and my favorite, Mochi balls. You’ll also find outlet stores of your favorite brands but at a more affordable rate. Gulangyu Island  A highlight of the trip was visiting the quaint and quiet Gulangyu Island. Only 7 minutes away from the main city, we enjoyed the steamboat ride as it gives a glimpse of the city and adds to the whole experience. “Gu” meaning drums and “Langyu” meaning waves – it’s an islet reminiscent of our Vigan heritage site combined with Malaysia’s Malacca. Picturesque and romantic, it’s no wonder that I saw several couples having their pre-nuptial photo shoots at the island’s secluded nooks. Each tourist site had something special to offer. Visit the Sunlight Rock (CNY60 or P425, $9), the Island’s highest point and gives a grand view of Gulangyu, Shuzhuang Garden (CNY30 or P212 or $5), which houses the only Piano Museum in China, Bright Moon Garden (CNY15 or P106 or $2.50), the Organ Museum (CNY20 or P141, $3.25) and the Calligraphic Carving Art Gallery (CNY10 or P71, $1.63). Gulangyu Tip 1: Buy an all access pass already at the pier. It saves you both time and money. It includes the top 5 sites at a discounted rate and you don’t have to line up at the actual ticket booths on the island. Staircase to heaven  Our last full day was dedicated to visiting the highlights of Xiamen. This sub-provincial city is known for their spiritual temples and spectacular gardens and views.  What we didn’t know is that to get to these places, involves a lot of walking. I actually had an epiphany that Kung Fu Panda was conceptualized in Xiamen and that’s why the panda Po hated stairs. I love working out and doing my squats and lunges, but wow, did I get jelly legs. Visit the stepper before you leave for Xiamen, trust me, it will help. First on our list was the Nanputuo Temple, a Buddhist temple known as the “Temple of a Thousand Years” but I will always remember as the Temple with a thousand small steps. I’m sure there weren’t a thousand steps but it sure felt like it. The torture was worth it though as each level offered stunning views and solemn grottos. Bring extra t-shirts to change. You’ll get sweaty. Right beside the temple, just a few steps away, is the Xiamen University. Take note that they only allow tourists after classes at 5pm. Our last stop and my favorite was a visit to Hongshan Park, just a bus ride away from Xiamen University. Again, stairs greeted us but as I was about to complain, I saw a glimpse of heaven. The gardens were beautiful and the gentle sound of waterfalls gave us an ethereal experience. We climbed the rickety tower and were granted a full 360-degree view of Xiamen. Different tastes Xiamen doesn’t serve your typical Chinese dishes. The first 2 days were difficult for us as it was so hard to even explain rice. Most of the meals we tried had tinges of curry, cumin or anise, which I’m not too fond of. Luckily, we found the Taiwan Snack Street on Renhe Road, Siming district of Xiamen and discovered stalls of Chow Fan and Fried Noodles (CNY4 or P29, $.65). It was also by chance we discovered kiosks on Zongshan Lu Road that sold Deep-fried breaded spicy Cuttlefish (CNY18 or P127, $2.93) and Oyster Cake (CNY15 or P106, $2.50) that I got addicted to. Food is pretty affordable, as long as you know where to eat. Explore your surroundings first and compare. Lost in the adventure Xiamen is a bewitching city. Their tourist spots rival any world heritage or national site in any other country, but it can also be a challenge for those who don’t speak the language. The buses we rode on didn’t even have English translations, and we needed to ask our front desk to write down which bus to take and point to the bus driver where to go.  But is you’re like me and love to just immerse herself and get lost in another culture – Xiamen is definitely for you. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/51255-stuck-zipper-deo-stains-get-over-life-little-emergencies-tips/","title":"Stuck zipper, deo stains: get over life’s little emergencies","date":"Feb 22, 2014 4:57 PM PHT","snippet":"You burned dessert? Can't find a taxi just when you're late – again? Here are basic solutions to everyday minor emergencies","body":" MANILA, Philippines – We all end up encountering minor emergencies everyday. But no matter how small they can be, you know that such things can either make or break your day. Here are some everyday problems that have unusual, yet simple, solutions. But hey, as long as it works, right? Stuck zippers One of the major hassles we may encounter in our daily lives is a malfunctioning zipper. Be it your bag or your jeans, there’s a way to loosen it and get it back working without having to pull hard and damage either the zipper itself or your newly manicured nails. Grab a graphite pencil and rub it on to your old, rusty zipper. Graphite should loosen it up and help you go your merry way.  You can also take a bobby pin, dip in soap, and wiggle it around in the jammed area – that should loosen it up.  Here’s a bonus. For a zippers on your jeans that won’t stay up, get a key ring, get it to go through the zipper’s hole and pull it over your pants button. You just avoided an embarrassing situation which involved exposing what’s behind your fly. Deodorant on your clothes Applying deodorant prior to putting on your shirt may leave you with embarrassing white stains on your shirt. Dabbing water over it won’t help, but there’s an easy way to get it off your clothes. Just rub the fabric against another fabric for a few seconds. Your shirt’s cloth fibers will most likely get it off. Baking failures Baking something for dinner with your boyfriend’s parents? Great idea. It will give them the impression that you’re thoughtful and that you get around – in the kitchen that is. But what happens when you end up enjoying Beyonce’s new music video so much and completely forget about what you had in the oven? And what will you do if you end up burning the pie or cake that you’re making, and you only have 20 minutes before your beau and his folks get to your house? Quick. Remove all the burnt parts of the pie/cake. Take what you can salvage and put them on separate plates. Top the crumbs with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and add a cut-up fruits or chocolate bits that you have in your fridge. Give it a fancy name with the word ‘crumble’ in it when his mom asks about your ‘creative’ dessert piece. Gum on your clothes have you ever sat on a bench or a seat on a bus only to find out that you have gum on your skirt? After you get over how gross it is, get your hand sanitizer and spray all over the area where the gum is stuck. Take some hairspray and spray all over the gum (careful not to get too much on the surrounding fabric) and let it dry. The hairspray will harden the gum and will help you pull it off easily. Cat lady problems Love your cat but hate the cat hair on your LBD (little black dress)? When a lint roller is not available, you can always grab a bag or anything that uses velcro to close and press the velcro over the cat hair on your dress. You can also try using scotch tape, pressing it over the dress lightly and carefully pulling it off with cat hair sticking on it. Puffy eyes Getting into a fight with your boyfriend the night before your big office presentation is never a good idea. But on days when you can’t help it and you end up shedding tears then looking like a raccoon in the morning, it’s best to make use of the teabags stocked in your pantry. Use cotton pads to soak up some green tea and put them in a fridge for a good 30 minutes (you can shower while you’re leaving them to cool). Once cold enough, place the cotton pads on your eyes and leave them there for about 10-15 minutes. The cold as well as green tea’s antioxidants will help your eyes relax and ease the puffiness. Use some white eye liner or shadow in the inner corners of your eyes to brighten them right up.  Running late on coding day We know how commuting can be a hassle during rush hour. And when you don’t have your car, chances are it can also be a nightmare to hail a cab. But with the dawn of technology comes the ease and comfort of getting your own cab without having to take your chances along the highway for hours. Nowadays, you can request for a pick up anywhere in Metro Manila just by using apps like Grab Taxi and Easy Taxi which you can download to your smartphone. A luxe alternative? A different kind of ride from Uber. Got basic solutions for everyday minor problems?

It was 9:30 in the morning and, from my bedroom, I could hear the familiar sound of knuckles on our iron front gate. A second later, the voice of our house assistant rang through the house as she called out my name. The cab I requested via GrabTaxi had arrived — more than 30 minutes early.  GrabTaxi, a new smartphone application that seeks to help commuters find cabs and cab drivers find passengers, was launched recently. I decided to take the app out for spin in the streets of Metro Manila.  READ: Need a cab? There’s an app for that! According to CEO and founder Anthony Tan, aside from helping people find a cab, GrabTaxi is also supposed to eliminate the all-too familiar commuter predicament of cab drivers turning down passengers, haggling over the fare and — of course — the constant worrying over the safety of the cab and its driver.  Through the app [available on both Android and iOS], passengers’ taxi bookings are blasted out to drivers within a 3 kilometer radius. Through smartphones used as dispatch tools, the taxis in the area are alerted of your request and can bid for the job. Once matched, both the driver and the passenger are given direct contacts to each other for better communication.  I used GrabTaxi twice in the course of two days: first in the evening, and the second instance in the next morning.  Here’s how it went: The app My first booking was on a Wednesday evening. I was coming from a cocktail party in one of the establishments along Bonifacio High Street in Taguig City. It had been a long night and the party just happened to revolve around different types of alcoholic beverages. Suffice to say I was intoxicated, dazed and a bit drowsy.   I opened the GrabTaxi app and it immediately determined my location with a dot on the map. In the first box, I indicated my exact location. In the second box I put in my home address. Within seconds, the app identified more than 10 cabs within a 3 kilometer radius of where I was. A few seconds later, a notice came up indicating a cab was already on its way to fetch me.  All the driver’s details were displayed on the screen: his name, mobile number, the car’s license plate number and a countdown of how many minutes it would take him to get where I was standing. If I looked closer, I would have actually seen him inch closer and closer to where I was standing on the map. For a first-time user, it was such a treat to stare at a moving taxi icon on the screen. I had a feeling the novelty was not going to wear off anytime soon. Punctuality It was 11:15pm. Based on the GPS tracking, my cab was less than a kilometer away. The app indicated that it would take him 5 minutes to arrive. A few seconds later, it said 4 minutes. It started to count down and then went back to 5 minutes. On the GPS, I could see he had gotten stuck somewhere in the Market! Market! area. 15 minutes later, at 11:30pm, Felipe Capion of Ultimax Transport pulled over in front of the curb where I was standing.  My second GrabTaxi driver the next morning was a little bit too excited. He was Jophel Calipayan of 24/7 Taxi Service. I had expected him to arrive at 10am, but at 9:30am he was already parked in front of our house, ready to go. Our destination was Taguig [again].  On the road We were headed to the South on a weekday morning. Taking EDSA was not an option. I asked Jophel to take C5 road instead. He agreed with my plan after asking for directions on how to get out of our village. At this point, the meter was still at P0. It was only after I sat down and closed the door that the driver started the meter with a P40 flat rate.  The cab was clean, had no suspicious stains on the upholstery and smelled of pine air freshener bought from the gas station. On both cabs, attached to the windshield was a mobile phone mount; in it sat a Cloud smartphone which was running the GrabTaxi app.  On the window of the right passenger seat was a printed, laminated brochure from GrabTaxi explaining how to download and use the application.  (Download Grab Taxi app for Android and iOS)  In the course of our journey along C5 that morning, my driver was in the perfect mood. He had an album of the Bee Gees playing in the background. As Robin Gibb sang, asking the perennial question of how to mend a broken heart, my driver used his turn signals properly, giving way to pedestrians and following traffic lights. My only gripe was that he wasn’t wearing his seatbelt. We spent the next 30 minutes talking about the app and how it has made finding passengers easier for him.  Felipe, on the other hand [from the night before], was not a chatty cabbie. However, being as it was close to midnight, I understood. I asked him why it took him 15 minutes to get to me. He said there was a slight vehicular accident around the mall area that stalled him a bit. After clicking in his seatbelt and punching a button on the meter to get it started, we were off into the night.  During the trip, passengers have the option of posting a message on Facebook or Twitter through the app. The message contains the car’s license number together with a link to the GrabTaxi website which allows your friends to follow your journey in real time. It’s an ingenious feature for those who make it a habit of texting people their cab license plate to a loved one. The GPS tracking makes it even better. However, I was in no mood to declare to the rest of the world where I was, and found no reason to suspect my driver was taking me somewhere else.  I arrived home some 20 minutes later. I paid the meter charge along with the additional P70 fee, and gave him a little extra considering the time.  Feedback Both my experiences were very successful. In the course of my morning ride with Jophen, though, he told me of an instance of double-booking: he arrived at the passenger’s home only to find out that another taxi, also affiliated with GrabTaxi, arrived earlier than him and picked the passenger up leaving him wondering what happened.  For most concerns, GrabTaxi has several lines of communication to receive passengers’ feedback. At the end of your journey, there’s an option in the app for you to send your feedback. Or at your own time, you can send them a tweet [@GrabTaxiPH], a message on Facebook [Facebook.com/GrabTaxiPH], or an e-mail [passenger.mnl@grabtaxi.com]. GrabTaxi is an app long overdue. In a place as chaotic, crowded and unpredictable like Metro Manila, it’s a concrete step towards creating a more organized, systematic and efficient way of riding public transportation — even if it is an air-conditioned cab. One can only hope that more fleets in the city [and, perhaps, the rest of the country] will recognize the benefits of using the application, for both passengers and drivers. Now if I could only pay for my fare with a credit card. – Rappler.com     Peter Imbong is a fulltime freelance writer, sometimes a stylist; and on some strange nights, a host.
