The PRC saliva RT-PCR test is the first and only in the country. The saliva RT-PCR test, in a study by the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign Campus (UIUC) and the University of the Philippines, is a reliable alternative to the Swab RT-PCR test. The saliva RT-PCR test is through the initiative of PRC chairperson and CEO Senator Richard Gordon to bring a faster, cheaper, and non-invasive alternative for the swab RT-PCR test. The PRC also innovates to make the saliva RT-PCR test accessible to the public through its local chapters and partnerships with malls such as SM, Robinsons, Araneta City, and Ayala Malls, making it to 124 collection sites nationwide. The PRC also partnered with Angkas, making the motorcycle ride-hailing app as a mobile saliva specimen collector to make RT-PCR tests convenient for the clients who want to get tested in the comfort of their homes. “Testing is key. Sa pag abot natin nang one million saliva tests conducted, ay patuloy na magtetest ang Philippine Red Cross sa ating mga kababayan. Malapit na magbukas ang mga paaralan, kaya dapat mas ipagtibay natin ang pagtetest at pagbabakuna upang labanan ang Covid-19 (In reaching one million saliva tests conducted, the Philippine Red Cross will continuously test our countrymen. The opening of classes is drawing near so we should ramp up our testing and vaccination to fight the Covid-19),” Gordon said in a news release on Saturday. The PRC is the leading organization with 4.8 million people tested. With the drive-thru collection sites nationwide, home service saliva collection sites, and the opening of the 14th PRC molecular laboratory in the Philippines, PRC will soon reach the five million mark in the following weeks, gearing to be a significant help in the battle against Covid-19. “The saliva RT-PCR test with an accuracy of 98.23 percent remains to be a game-changer for our country. The reduced cost of testing (PHP 1,500), gives way to test more people such as students, employees, factory workers, healthcare workers, and other essential workers. Rest assured that PRC remains committed to its duty of finding ways to test more and keep Filipinos out of harm’s way,” Gordon said.

The memorandum is part of a series of executive orders regarding racial equity and civil rights signed by Biden. \"The Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the Covid-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin,\" it said, \"Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.\" According to the document, the pandemic response from federal health authorities should demonstrate \"cultural competency, language access, and sensitivity towards AAPIs.\" In addition, the memorandum orders federal agencies to look into whether discriminatory rhetoric like \"China Virus\" is referred to in any existing policies or federal websites published by the previous administration. It also issued guidance for the Department of Justice on how to further prevent hate crimes and harassment against these racial groups, including better data collection of anti-Asian hate incidents with the assistance of AAPI communities. \"It's time to act now, not only because it's the right thing to do, but because if we do, we'll all be better off for it,\" Biden said at a signing ceremony at the White House. Biden also signed executive orders directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development to address racially discriminatory federal housing policies and the Department of Justice to end its use of private prisons. \"I think these are very promising... And I think it's just the beginning. There's a lot more work that needs to be done,\" Manju Kulkarni, the executive director of Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council (A3PCON), said of the memorandum. Throughout last year, then US President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus\" despite guidance from public health officials to avoid attaching locations or ethnicity to a disease. A study published in the journal Health Education & Behavior suggests that such racist rhetoric has had a profound impact on how those in the United States see Asian Americans, noting the language led to an increased subconscious belief that Asian Americans are \"perpetual foreigners.\" \"Research suggests that when people see Asian Americans as being more 'foreign,' they are more likely to express hostility toward them and engage in acts of violence and discrimination,\" said Rucker Johnson, a public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-author of the study. \"Words matter. People are making that close association between the virus and Chinese people because he insisted on using that term,\" said Russell Jeung, chairman of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University. Stop AAPI Hate, an online reporting center, recorded 2,583 anti-Asian incidents across the country between March and August last year. Victims said they were spat on, stabbed while shopping, shunned for wearing masks and barred from entering ride-hailing vehicles. An estimated 2 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have served on the front lines of combating the pandemic as health care providers, first responders, and other essential roles, according to a Huffington Post report.

Aminoden Guro, LTFRB-10 regional director, said a technical working group (TWG) created to look into Angkas’ application has recommended that the firm should seek approval from the local government before it is allowed to return to the streets. The TWG is composed of LTFRB-10, Land Transportation Office-10, Cagayan de Oro City Police Office, Traffic Management Group, Highway Patrol Group, and Roads and Traffic Administration. Guro said the TWG has discussed how Angkas could resume operations in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) has earlier green-lighted Angkas to resume its operation, upon the recommendation from the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) in November. The agency has allowed Angkas and other motorcycle-hailing firms MoveIt and Joyride to operate in Metro Manila, Cebu City, and in this city. In this city, each player is permitted to operate a maximum of 3,000 units or a total of 9,000 motorcycles. So far, only Angkas has applied for a permit to operate here with at least 804 units, as of February this year. Angkas was supposed to officially start ferrying passengers early this year here but it did not push through after President Rodrigo Duterte declared a nationwide health emergency following the increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the country in March. Guro said among the factors that the TWG is studying is the use of a protective barrier between the driver and his pillion, and the requirement of passengers to use their own helmets. He said this is to keep in mind the threat of the coronavirus which could be transmitted from person to person. Meanwhile, city councilor Romeo Calizo, chairman of public order and safety, and roads and traffic management said the city government must discuss Angkas’ application with experts so aspects such as traffic congestion and pollution could be given consideration. “We must also consider the restrictions set by the DILG so we will know which provisions of the local IATF we need to comply,” he said. Calizo said his committee is concerned with the safety of both riders and passengers as he noted that most road accidents involve motorcycles. City councilor George Goking, chair of the trade and commerce committee, said he welcomes the operation of Angkas and other groups to give the riding public cheaper option. “We want to have a cheaper mode of transportation for our people, so they will have a better choice,” Goking said. Jerome Angcolo, Angkas city manager for Cagayan de Oro, said they are targeting to go back on the road within the month. He said their application’s status is “pending since there are documents and processes we need to comply first before we can resume our operation here in Cagayan de Oro.” When pressed further, Angcolo did not elaborate, although he said they are hopeful they can operate again. In previous interviews, Angeline Tham, Angkas chief executive officer, has assured that the company has complied with all the requirements set by the DOTr.

During the plenary session, the chamber approved House Bill 7805, or the proposed Internet Transactions Act, with 232 affirmative votes, six negative votes, and no abstention. The bill seeks to regulate all business-to-business and business-to-consumer commercial transactions over the internet, including those related to internet retail, online travel services, digital media providers, ride hailing services, and digital financial services. The proposed e-commerce bureau will serve as the “central authority” tasked to regulate online trade and shall act as a virtual one-stop-shop for consumer complaints on internet transactions. Valenzuela City Rep. Wes Gatchalian, author of the bill, said the proposed bureau will only have authority over those activities which are currently not regulated but are nevertheless conducted over the internet. “Any regulation of the eCommerce Bureau that may affect regulated industries shall only be ancillary to the government agency or instrumentality exercising primary jurisdiction over that specific activity,” he said. Gatchalian said the bill will not cover consumer-to-consumer transactions, or those considered petty, one-off, or occasional low-value transactions. Under the bill, online e-commerce platforms such as Lazada, Shopee, and Zalora shall share solidary liability with their own merchants if these platforms fail to exercise extraordinary diligence to prevent any loss or damage to the consumer; fail to publish the details of their merchants; fail to examine goods related to food, drugs, cosmetics, among others. The proposed law makes it illegal to cancel orders for food and/or grocery items made via ride hailing services when the said items have already been paid by or are already in the possession of the ride hailing service partner or in transit to the consumer. It will also be illegal to “unreasonably shame, demean, embarrass, or humiliate ride hailing service partners.” A consumer, however, may cancel an order if the delivery of ordered food or grocery items was delayed for at least an hour from the expected time of arrival due to the fault or negligence of the ride-hailing service partner. To encourage businesses to go online and for foreign organizations to choose to register with the e-commerce bureau, the Department of Trade and Industry will be required to lead the establishment of an industry-led eCommerce Trustmark. “This Trustmark will represent safety and security in internet transactions which will ultimately build consumer confidence and lead to a robust growth of the internet economy. As consumers, you will want to deal with entities which have been given this seal of approval. As a merchant, you would want to have this Trustmark on your website so that your consumers can transact with peace of mind,” Gatchalian said.

(LKI) said on Tuesday discounts for senior citizens and persons with disabilities (PWDs) should also be applicable in online transactions.  In a statement, LKI president Victorio Mario Dimagiba said the group submitted a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to clarify the implementing guidelines in availing of senior citizens and PWD discounts in online purchases.  “Most senior citizens and persons with disability above 65 years old purchase food items and other goods online and are not able to claim the discounts granted by law. In most cases, the merchants do not know what and how to grant the discounts,” said Dimagiba, a former DTI senior official.  The consumer group added the discounts for senior citizens and PWDs should also be applied in services offered by ride-hailing businesses.  “We were able to set up the guidelines on airline domestic transportation discounts done through online booking. We know we can develop the guidelines on online transactions by senior citizens and persons with disability for the uniform and standard implementation of the discounts,” Dimagiba said.  Under the implementing rules and regulations of Republic Act No. 9994, senior citizens and PWDs are entitled to a 20-percent discount and an exemption from the 12-percent value-added tax (VAT) on the sale of goods and services.  These include medical-related privileges, domestic transportation privileges, hotels, restaurants, recreational centers and places of leisure, and funeral and burial services.  Dimagiba added the “clear and convenient implementation” of senior citizen and PWD discounts would be timely with the challenges and difficulties brought about by the coronavirus disease pandemic and the community quarantine measures.  “Right now, it is important that the spirit of these initiatives is consistent and is carried out for all parties, in order to ease their burden during this tough year, where senior citizens may often feel restricted, depleted, and even powerless,” Dimagiba said.

According to Assistant Secretary Wilben Mayor, head of the NTF's sub-task group on current operations, the decrease of the occupancy rate in hospitals and government quarantine facilities has somehow eased medical professionals and healthcare workers who are treating Covid-19 patients. During a Laging Handa public briefing on Tuesday, Mayor said the NAP Phase 3 has allowed the country to slowly revive the economy. The government has recently increased the passenger capacity on public transportations up to 30 percent and allowed the resumption of ride-hailing motorcycle taxis, Mayor said. The age-based stay-at-home restrictions and the curfew hours have also been adjusted, he added. Mayor said the government's response to the pandemic must be \"dynamic and evolving\" in accordance with the country's current health crisis situation. He added that there are many aspects in Covid-19 responses and efforts that needed to be adjusted based on the latest scientific data and pandemic situation. Mayor said the NTF believes that the number of Covid-19 cases would continue to go down in the coming months as it observed a gradual decrease of infections, in general. He reminded the public not to be complacent and observe the minimum health standards being imposed. \"Kung tayo po ay magpabaya at babalik sa ating mga dating nakasanayan, maaaring tumaas muli ang bilang ng mga kaso (If we neglect [the health protocols] and go back to our usual habits, the number of cases may spike again),\" Mayor told the public. Mayor said people should continue to adhere to the government's health protocols and quarantine policies while waiting for the availability of the Covid-19 vaccine. Compliance with these health measures are even more vital as the government further eases quarantine restrictions with the gradual opening of the economy, he said.

Johana Vi Gasga, DOLE-Bicol spokesperson, on Thursday said the drivers were able to receive their wages recently through the agency's Camarines Norte provincial field office. Gasga said the drivers were hired for a 10-day period and performed sanitation work for their dwellings and immediate vicinity. \"These beneficiaries were among those applicants who were not accommodated under the TUPAD #BKBK Program,\" she said. With the implementation of the program's Post-Covid project, the drivers became eligible for emergency employment and hired as TUPAD workers. This entitled them to a wage of PHP310 per day which is equivalent to PHP3,100 for 10 days. Renalyn Alano, Camarines Norte Livelihood Program focal person, in a statement said the income of drivers has been severely affected by the imposed health protocols against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as they can only accept passengers at 50 percent capacity during the community quarantine “This left them with a meager income which was not enough to make both ends meet,” she said.

Eleazar clarified that motorcycle barriers would remain as a requirement for drivers and back riders who are not living in the same house, even if they are relatives. Based on health protocols, both riders should wear face masks and full-face helmets \"that must be worn all the time while back riding.\" Meanwhile, in areas under modified GCQ, local government units have the sole authority to implement the guidelines based on their situation. The lifting of some restrictions on motorcycle pillion riding is proof that the NTF has been heeding the concerns and suggestions of the public, he said. “As what Secretary of the Interior and Local Government Eduardo Año repeatedly said in the past, we will try to normalize the motorcycle pillion riding but this should be done gradually to prevent abuses by some hard-headed riders,” Eleazar said. Based on data from JTF Covid Shield, a total of 57,973 motorcycle riders were warned and cited for violation of the rules on pillion riding since motorcycle back riding was allowed from July 10 until August 18. Aside from Metro Manila and the provinces of Rizal, Cavite, Laguna, and Bulacan, he said the same rules on motorcycle pillion riding would apply in other areas under GCQ, among them Nueva Ecija, Batangas, Quezon, Iloilo City, Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu City, Mandaue City, Talisay City, and the municipalities of Minglanilla and Consolacion in Cebu province. Eleazar said those who have already bought the motorcycle barriers have the option to use them even if they back ride with their spouses, partners, and other family members who live in the same house. “Although it is no longer required, the use of the prescribed barrier is still advised because what we are preventing here is mass infection within the family. Once one family member is infected, it is usually certain that the rest of the family members would suffer. So we advise motorcycle riders to still take precautionary measures,” he added.

Interior Secretary Eduardo Año and task force chief, Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar received the motorcycle barriers from Angkas head transport advocate George Royeca in a simple ceremony in Camp Crame, Quezon City “This benevolent act of the Angkas Group led by Mr. George Royeca is a clear manifestation that the spirit of bayanihan is very much alive and continues to be a defining value of Filipinos especially in this time of global pandemic,” Eleazar said. In coordination with Philippine National Police (PNP) chief, Gen. Archie Francisco Gamboa, Eleazar said the motorcycle barriers will be given to various police stations in Metro Manila for distribution to qualified motorcycle drivers. He added that they will give priority to motorcycle riders who regularly ferry their spouses, live-in partners, relatives and friends who work as medical front-liners. “With this initiative, we are honored of this opportunity for your JTF Covid Shield to effectively shield both motorcycle drivers and their back-riders from possible coronavirus infection because this is who we are, this is what we are mandated to do, and this is the frontline that we must hold and defend to eventually protect as many Filipino people from the coronavirus disease 2019,” he added. Meanwhile, based on the agreement between the JTF Covid Shield and Angkas, 1,000 Angkas riders would be deployed near hospitals identified by the Department of Health to provide free rides to health workers attending to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, particularly the Philippine General Hospital, San Lazaro Hospital, Ospital ng Sampaloc in Manila; the East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City; and the Tala Hospital in Caloocan City. Some Angkas riders will also be placed on standby at the National Kidney Institute, Quezon City General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Quirino Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City; and, Ospital ng Maynila as well as Fabella Hospital in Manila. Medical workers who are on their way home could approach the Angkas riders and present their identification cards to avail of free rides on their way back to their respective places of residence. “This endeavor will ensure that our medical front-liners can perform their tasks and not be hampered by lack of transportations on their way for work, and back home,” Eleazar added. Meanwhile, Año defended anew the government's motorcycle barrier policy. He said those who continue to criticize have nothing better to suggest, adding that waiving the requirement could result in the greater number of people being infected by Covid-19. While admitting that some of them might be experts in motorcycle riding or operations, Año said they should study first pandemics before protesting. The barrier requirement drew flak from motorcycle groups who cited the aspect of aerodynamics, with some calling the idea “stupid”, alleging that it can cause more harm to the rider and its passengers. However, Año said the measure has a scientific basis, noting the requirement is also being used by Indonesia as part of their anti-Covid-19 prevention measures. Last month, the National Task Force Against Covid-19 allowed pillion riding with the use of barriers only for married couples and live-in partners who are living in the same residence. However, pillion riding was allowed for front-liners and Authorized Persons Outside Residence (APOR) in areas placed under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) such as Metro Manila and the provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna and Cavite, provided that it follows the barriers requirement and that no fees are involved. Royeca earlier conceptualized one of two designs of motorcycle barriers which were later approved by the government in compliance with safety protocols for pillion riding amid the health crisis.

Valenzuela Rep. Wes Gatchalian, panel chair, said the proposed Internet Transactions Act seeks to regulate all business-to-business and business-to-consumer commercial transactions conducted over the internet, including those related to internet retail, online travel services, digital media providers, ride hailing services and digital financial services. Gatchalian said the e-commerce bureau will be the “central authority” tasked to regulate online trade and shall act as a virtual one stop shop for consumer complaints on internet transactions. He said the proposed bureau “will only have authority over those activities which are currently not regulated but are nevertheless conducted over the internet.” “Any regulation of the eCommerce Bureau that may affect regulated industries shall only be ancillary to the government agency or instrumentality exercising primary jurisdiction over that specific activity,” he added. According to Gatchalian, the bill will not cover consumer-to-consumer transactions, or those considered petty, one-off, or occasional low value transactions. Under the bill, online e-commerce platforms such as Lazada, Shopee and Zalora shall share solidary liability with their own merchants if these platforms fail to exercise extraordinary diligence to prevent any loss or damage to the consumer; fail to take necessary measures against products sold on their platforms that do not comply with law; or fail to publish the details of their merchants, among others. The proposed law makes it illegal to cancel orders for food and/or grocery items made via ride hailing services when the said items have already been paid by or is already in the possession of the ride hailing service partner or in transit to the consumer. It will also be illegal to “unreasonably shame, demean, embarrass, or humiliate ride hailing service partners.” A consumer, however, may cancel an order if the delivery of ordered food or grocery items was delayed for at least an hour from the expected time of arrival due to the fault or negligence of the ride-hailing service partner. To encourage businesses to go online and for foreign organizations to choose to register with the e-commerce bureau, the Department of Trade and Industry will be required to lead the establishment of an industry-led eCommerce Trustmark. “This Trustmark will represent safety and security in internet transactions which will ultimately build consumer confidence and lead to a robust growth of the internet economy. As consumers, you will want to deal with entities which have been given this seal of approval. As a merchant, you would want to have this Trustmark on your website so that your consumers can transact with peace of mind,” he said.

Police Lt. Gen. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, JTF Covid shield commander, said the 7,091 violators recorded as of July 18 showed government’s resolve to implement the two rules for back riding -- that there must be installed barriers that pass the safety standard of the National Task Force (NTF) for Covid-19 and the riders must be married or living-in couples. “For a long time, motorcycle riders had repeatedly requested the government to allow at least their partners to back-ride with them due to limited public transportation. And now that the government finally granted their request, they openly and brazenly disregarded the rules that the government was asking from them in return to ensure their safety from coronavirus infection,” Eleazar said in a statement. He said most of the violators were caught back-riding with other relatives, friends, neighbors and other people which is in violation of the NTF for Covid-19 guidelines that the pillion riding is exclusive for married and living-in couples. Eleazar said of the 7,091 accosted violators, 6,476 were not only couples but also with no installed barriers while 615 riders have barriers but were not couple or live-in partners. Police Regional Office 7 (Central Visayas) has the most number of accosted violators with 1,755 unauthorized back riders followed by Police Regional Office 5 (Bicol) with 741 violators; Police Regional Office 6 (Western Visayas) with 737; and, Police Regional Office 3 (Central Luzon) with 675. He said motorcycle riders have until July 26 to install either a prototype plastic shield as proposed by Bohol Governor Arthur Yap or a barrier designed by motorcycle ride-hailing platform Angkas. “Let us allow the government to slowly implement these rules in order to ensure that everybody would comply and at the same time, for our law enforcers on the ground not to be overwhelmed by the large number of violators which was actually recorded in just a few days after pillion riding was allowed,\" Eleazar said. He said success in the compliance of the rules on pillion riding “could serve as the basis for our policymakers to expand and allow more people for back-riding.” Last Saturday, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año reminded the couples riding motorcycles to bring with them documents proving that they are married or common-law partners. He said mandatory installation of safety barriers has been extended until July 26 to give riders enough time to comply. Beginning July 27, Año said authorities will start issuing citation tickets to violators amid the government’s imposition of quarantine measures to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak. Motorists earlier asked for an extension to ensure that their compliance conforms with the safety standards set by the NTF for Covid-19. “We hope that the two-week grace period is more than enough for motorists to conform to the safety standards of the two approved designs to ensure the safety of both the driver and the riders,” Eleazar said.

Royeca said the barrier is \"rigid but flexible upon impact\" and the thin durable plastic sheet can survive massive force without shattering and shaking. “The set of rules for motorcycle back-riding is a balance between safety and the necessity of transportation. Our motorists have long requested for this and now that it was finally granted, please do not abuse it,” said Eleazar.

Garcia issued Executive Order No. 19 on Wednesday regulating the use of motorcycles and specifically permitting “private owners to transport a passenger or back rider” as an answer to the lack of public transportation in towns and cities in the province during the general community quarantine. However, Garcia’s order provides that there should be only one passenger allowed per trip and no fee should be charged. This means that ride-hailing app Angkas and “habal-habal” as modes of transportation for a fee are not allowed in the province while under general community quarantine and succeeding quarantine classifications. The order said that both the driver and passenger must wear Department Trade and Industry (DTI)-approved helmets under R.A. 10054, the Motorcycle Helmet Act of 2009. “Both driver and passenger must wear closed shoes” and observe “applicable mandatory health standards” concerning the effort to prevent the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Garcia directed all the mayors in 44 municipalities and six component cities to issue their own executive orders adopting the provisions of EO 19. The Provincial Board will convene on Friday to pass an ordinance allowing motorcycle back riding, as the EO said it will only take effect upon effectivity of the said measure. The mayors who attended the meeting with Garcia, along with the regional officials of the Land Transportation Office and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, praised the governor’s decision.

The suspects are currently detained at PDEA and will be facing charges for violating Sections 5 and 12 of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

Eduardo Montealto Jr., regional director of Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB-7), said the operatives apprehended on Thursday two private car drivers without proper documentation. He said the drivers of these vehicles use the ride-hailing app inDriver which has not applied for accreditation with the LTFRB to engage as transportation network company (TNC). “On Feb. 19, the joint ACO (anti-colorum operation) of the Highway Patrol Group (HPG-7) and LTFRB-7 apprehended the two colorum TNVS inside a mall in Mandaue City,” he told Philippine News Agency (PNA) in a message. Since inDriver is not one of the accredited TNCs in Cebu, he said the two drivers are engaged in colorum operation and will be penalized as they are without authority or a certificate of public convenience (CPC). He also said on Feb. 13, an anti-colorum operation “resulted in the apprehension and subsequently impounding of two units of Innova using non-accredited inDriver\" ride-hailing apps.” The penalty would be PHP120,000 for Sedan cars, PHP200,000 for Sports Utility Vehicles, Vans and Pick-up type and PHP1 million for coasters and higher classification vehicles. Like inDriver, Montealto said another Russian ride-hailing apps, Maxim, has been monitored to be operating in Cebu without an accreditation from his office. The Feb. 7 joint operation of the LTFRB-7 and HPG-7 caught a Kia Picanto and a Mitsubishi Strada pickup truck for using the Maxim app in booking trips from passengers. However, the Maxim Service, in a statement sent to the PNA, apologized for the inconvenience caused by the apprehensions. “At the moment, Maxim is only testing the software and preparing to start working in Cebu. Among other things, the company is in the process of obtaining all the necessary permitting documents. At this stage, we are in the process of registering with the SEC,” the statement read. It added that immediately after the registration of a legal entity, Maxim will submit the documents to LTFRB to obtain accreditation to engage as TNC. “In order not to lose this time and to prepare for a full launch, Maxim is testing the application and checking rates settings. In this way we will be able to optimally set up the service so that passengers and drivers can use it by the start of the company's operations,” it said. The company vowed to start its activities only after receiving all the documents required by law.

Retired Col. Eduardo Montealto Jr., regional director of LTFRB-7, said that Maxim, a ride-sharing app that originated from Shadrinsk, Russia is actively operating in Cebu despite absence of accreditation from their office. “On Feb. 7, a joint operation with LTFRB-7 and Highway Patrol Group-7 apprehended a transport network vehicle service (TNVS) using the so-called Maxim ride-hailing app. The units that we apprehended are a Kia Picanto and a Mitsubishi Strada pickup type truck,” Montealto said. Maxim has not sought accreditation with the LTFRB to operate legally as a ride-hailing app for booking of trips by customers via mobile phones or tablets, he said. Montealto admitted there are so many unaccredited TNVS operating in Cebu and using apps that are not registered with the agency. Last month, LTFRB-7 operatives apprehended six cars for illegally operating as TNVS using inDriver, another unaccredited ride-hailing app. Both inDriver and Maxim are not among the list of LTFRB-recognized apps such as Grab Car, MiCab, Hype and Hirna. InDriver was founded in 2012 but Maxim started as a modern taxi-ride ordering service in Russia in 2003 and simultaneously opened branches in seven cities worldwide in 2009. It expanded to 17 more cities in 2010. Montealto lamented that Filipino counterparts of Maxim and inDriver operators abroad could clandestinely operate in Cebu without fear being detected by authorities. According to initial investigation by the LTFRB-7, Maxim has revealed in its Facebook account the address of its office along J. De Veyra Street in North Reclamation Area here. Montealto, however, said operations personnel will continue to monitor their movements and conduct apprehensions against TNVS operators using Maxim and inDriver based on intelligence reports that they can gather. TNVS operating via unaccredited ride-hailing app are not paying taxes to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, he said. He said the two vehicles apprehended on Friday in a mall in Mandaue City were placed in the impounding area pending payment of penalty ranging from PHP120,000 to PHP200,000 for engaging in colorum operations, aside from being blacklisted for 90 days. LTFRB record showed Cebu has reached the cap of 1,500 TNVS while the request for additional units has not yet been approved by the board.

Chairman of the Department of Transportation's Technical Working Group on Motorcycle Taxis (TWG) Antonio Gardiola Jr. said Friday motorcycle taxis that insist on operating in the guise of a participant of the study and are not on the master list would be apprehended as “colorum”. \"We will not have second thoughts to penalize those who defy the authority,\" Gardiola said. Two motorcyclists from SAMPA and five belonging to Angkas were apprehended. The TWG said SAMPA, and another called i-SABAY, are motorcycle ride-hailing platforms operating without the group’s consent. Only Angkas, Move It, and JoyRide are allowed in the pilot study. The five motorcyclists from Angkas were caught by “mystery passengers” for working while unregistered in the accredited master list of the TWG. These mystery passengers, according to the TWG, were undercover informants who book rides with motorcycle taxi operators to check on the safety gear and documents of riders. Gardiola said mystery passengers would be deployed during the pilot study to verify the safety and documents of operating motorcycle taxis. Following the apprehension, he called on the three accredited motorcycle-taxi platforms to make sure their riders are registered in the master list. “I also appeal to our participating players to please register your participants with the TWG and submit a daily ridership report,” Gardiola said. The pilot study, revised last December to include two new platforms as competition to Angkas, will run until March and was made to study the safety, viability, and legislation of motorcycles as public transportation.

Stella Quimbo on Wednesday said Grab would continue to monopolize the ride-hailing market if transport authorities do not allow the entry of motorcycle taxi operators. In a statement, Grab said Quimbo’s statement revealed that on-demand and platform-based motorcycle taxis were “effectively competing” with Grab, as withdrawing motorcycle taxis would limit consumer choices on transportation. “It is in the same spirit that we respectfully seek the PCC to review the basis for defining the competitive market in which ride-hailing services operate,” Grab said in a statement. It said the ride-hailing competitive market could also be broadened to include street-hailing transportation such as taxis. “Right now, what we hope for is to review the basis for defining the competitive market and that would include motorcycle taxis and taxis as well,” Grab said. It said the voluntary commitments (VC) made by Grab with the PCC to improve service quality, pricing and transparency following its acquisition of then competitor Uber, were “totally different” from their call to review the definition of the ride-hailing market. “We cannot right away apply for release from VCs because there are certain market share thresholds that will have to be met per player before we can apply for release. That’s why we need the PCC to clarify the definition of competitive market,” Grab said. Earlier, PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said Grab could be released from its VCs if the company proves that its services were substitutable with motorcycle taxis and that the substitute or competitor has acquired a certain percentage or threshold in the market. He added that once motorcycle taxis were established as a public utility vehicle, Grab would then have to prove whether four-wheeled vehicles such as Grab’s would be substitutable with two-wheeled vehicles such as motorcycle taxis.

In a media interview, Senator Grace Poe said the decision of the Inter-Agency TWG on Motorcycle Taxis is wrong because of the “lack of proper consultation.” Poe, chair of the Senate Committee on Public Services, said the decision appears to be aimed at getting back at some motorcycle ride-hailing firms who are continuously questioning and challenging the TWG. “Ang nangyayari dito, naiinis sila (TWG) kasi nagra-rally ang ibang kompanya, nagpa-file ng kaso laban sa kanila, kaya ginagawa nila ito. So parang arbitrary, hindi base sa rason, kundi base lang sa gusto nilang gawin (They are annoyed because some companies are staging rallies and filing cases against them, that's why they are doing this. It seemed arbitrary, it is not based on reason but only based on what they wanted to do),” Poe told reporters after the Senate hearing. “Sobrang nakaka-dismaya na ganyan magpatakbo ang mga ibang miyembro ng gobyerno… kaya dapat nga kinukwestiyon kung ano ba talaga ang kanilang competence para mamuno ng programa na yan (It’s very dismaying that some members of government work this way… their competence to head that program should be questioned),” she added. Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) board member Antonio Gardiola Jr. earlier announced that the TWG is recommending the termination of the pilot run on motorcycle taxis due to legal actions taken by one of the motorcycle-hailing firms involved in the study. Poe said her panel would not stop on asking members of the TWG to attend the Senate hearings on the legalization of motorcycle taxis until they reconsider their position and continue the pilot program until its intended deadline on March 23. She said the law that the Senate intends to pass on motorcycle taxis should be based on the result of careful studies, which the TWG is supposed to conduct. “Hindi nila pwedeng i-pressure ang Senado at Kongreso na dapat magkaroon na ng batas dahil ang Congress ay hindi dapat maglabas ng batas kung wala kaming sapat na datos. Kaya pinag-aaralan nating mabuti para ang batas na ilalabas natin ay makatarungan at epektibo (They cannot pressure the Senate and the House that a law should be passed, because Congress could not pass a law if we have no complete data. That’s why we need careful study so that the law that we pass would be just and effective),” Poe said. Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto and Senator Sherwin Gatchalian echoed Poe’s sentiments. Recto observed that the TWG recommendation to suddenly end the pilot testing seemed “filled with anger.” “Pag binasa ko ‘yung dokumento parang napakatindi ng galit ninyo (On reading the document, it seems that you are very angry),” he said during Senate hearing. He also said imposing a 10,000 bikers limit for each motorcycle-hailing firm participating in the pilot study has no enough public consultation, as proven by the temporary restraining order (TRO) granted by the courts halting its implementation. “Maliwanag sa dokumentong ito, puro galit din. Dahil nag-rally laban sa inyo, galit na kaagad kayo. Kulang kayo sa public consultation, ‘yan ang problema ninyo (It is clear in this document, it is full of anger. Because they staged a rally against you, you immediately got angry. You lacked public consultation, that is your problem),” Recto said. Gatchalian agreed with Recto, saying he could not see the basis to terminate the pilot testing on motorcycle taxis. “Wala ho kasing basehan ‘tong lahat, at narinig niyo naman po ‘yung sinabi ng ating mga senador, at lahat ho kami sumasangayon na hindi ho tama itong resolusyon na ginawa ninyo dahil kawawa at nagdudusa ho ang ating mga pasahero (These are all baseless, and you heard what our senators said, all of us agree that your resolution is not right because our riding public are suffering),” Gatchalian said.

Eduardo Montealto Jr., regional director of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in Region 7 (Central Visayas), said on Wednesday that although inDriver maintains a \"virtual office\" with no physical office in Cebu, it has been actively operating through social media. This, Montealto said, was despite the warning he issued on Monday against private car owners and taxi operators not to use the app as it has not been accredited with the LTFRB as transport network vehicle service (TNVS). “We have conducted intelligence gathering for one month after we received the report that inDriver is engaging the public using Facebook. It’s impossible for them to operate legally as there is an existing moratorium from the Department of Transportation (DOTr) on the accreditation of new TNCs (transport network companies),” Montealto said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency. He said only Grab Car, MiCab, Hype, and Hirna are the legitimate ride-hailing apps in Cebu. There are three more TNVS that have a pending application for accreditation with the LTFRB-7, but Montealto said that due to DOTr’s moratorium, their operations remain pending. He said inDriver, a Russia-based ride-hailing app, is not among the applicants to operate as TNVS. He said despite the moratorium, inDriver continues to entice Cebuanos to use their private cars to earn income. “It’s easy to use inDriver. All that a car owner can do is to register with the app and submit their documentary requirements through electronic transmission. It means that there is no human contact as what they have here is just a virtual office,” he added. Montealto said inDriver has not been collecting a commission from the car owners, unlike the legitimate ride-hailing apps which have an established sharing-scheme. He reiterated that private cars apprehended for colorum operation will be slapped with PHP120,000 penalty for sedan models and PHP200,000 for van and sports utility vehicles (SUV), aside from the mandatory 90-day impounding of the unit. Impounded cars, he said, can be released earlier than 90 days but not earlier than 30 days, through a motion addressed to his office. “We are quite sure that InDriver operators and drivers have not undergone the mandatory defensive driver training and the driver’s academy training of the LTFRB. They don’t also have passenger insurance,” Montealto added. He also said that inDriver is not a safe transport system as it does not have the gadget to detect a vehicle's location. “They can unscrupulously use it to kidnap anyone because you cannot trace them,” he said.

The court said the decision to dismiss the petition was made to “avoid issuing writ which would effectively dispose of the main case without trial and/or due process.” It added that if the court would grant the injunctive writ, it would mean that the court would have “prejudged the main case and reversed the rule on the burden of proof.” The court also ruled that the DOTr and LTFRB have in their favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, which Angkas failed to rebut. “The presumption of regularity of official acts may be rebutted by affirmative evidence or irregularity or failure to perform a duty. The presumption, however, prevails until it is overcome by no less than clear and convincing evidence to the contrary,” the order read. The TWG’s Revised General Guidelines for the Pilot Implementation of Motorcycles indicated that motorcycle taxi riders shall be limited to 30,000 in Metro Manila and 9,000 in Metro Cebu -- divided equally between the three qualified TNCs -- Angkas, JoyRide, and Move It. The new limit effectively slashed the accredited riders of Angkas from 27,000 to 10,000 -- which the company did not accept lightly by responding with a petition for a 72-hour TRO against the revised guidelines, which it obtained on January 6. Following an apology from Angkas for its alleged bullying tactics and defiance of government guidelines, the DOTr and the TWG on Friday called out the company for its “two-faced” position on the pilot run. This came after Angkas filed a petition before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court for a TRO against the new rider cap and apprehension of “excess riders”.

Although unaccredited with the LTFRB central office, inDriver emerged in Cebu two weeks ago and enticed taxi operators and private car owners to use the app for passenger booking. Montealto said inDriver has no accreditation to operate as TNVS in the country, not even in Cebu. Accordingly, inDriver was founded in Russia in 2012 and operates in 31 countries around the world but it has neither an office nor an operational base in Manila and in any part of the country. The regional director of LTFRB-7 said he could not ascertain who are behind the operations of inDriver in Cebu as they could not locate its office here. “One of the owners who came to the LTFRB-7 regional office confided that private car owners like him and the taxi operators were enticed to go into TNVS because a public official himself posted in his Facebook account patronizing inDriver ride-hailing app as a sideline income using his own car,” Montealto said in a message sent to the Philippine News Agency on Sunday. He said taxi operators and private car owners planning to engage in app-based passenger booking service should choose accredited TNVS. “They may inquire at our regional office to know which are the legitimate Transport Network Companies (TNCs) accredited by LTFRB and the list of the requirements,” he said.

The DOTr said Angkas previously assured that it would no longer object to Section 10 or the imposition of a cap on riders of the revised guidelines of the pilot run of the TWG and was open to competition from other transport groups. Royeca’s apology came after TWG officials issued a warning against Angkas after the company was found to have made violations that could result in it being \"blacklisted\" when the TWG submits its findings and recommendations to Congress for the legalization of motorcycles as taxis. These violations include the illicit operation of Angkas riders in Cagayan de Oro City and the alleged “99.9 percent” ownership of Angkas by Singaporean national Angeline Tham.

In a radio interview, Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Party-list Rep. Jericho Nograles said since the operation of Angkas is just a pilot stage and is not covered by any government franchise like other public conveyances, the LTFRB can take any action they see fit to protect the public interest. Nograles noted that the LTFRB can impose a PHP6,000-fine per motorcycle per day against Angkas for operating without any franchise. He also cited documents showing that Angkas is 98 percent foreign-owned, which could be another basis to shut down its operation as it violates a constitutional provision requiring that all public utility companies should be 60 percent Filipino-owned. “Ang legal status ng motorcyle-for-hire ay wala pa talaga silang totoong prangkisa at sila ay naka-test mode.

Royeca also expressed his hope for the riders' cap imposed on the firm to be lifted so that everyone can proceed with the extended pilot run smoothly and without any hitches. “But on the same breath, we ask for fairness, in consideration of all the hard work we have done to comply with government regulators since last year,” he noted. Royeca also clarified that they are not picking a fight with government regulators. “Pasensya na po sa naging (We apologize for being) back and forth. Please don't mistake what we did as defiance. Right from start, we worked hard to be compliant with everything the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the (Department of Transportation's) TWG (technical working group) had set in the first motorcycle taxi test run. For six whole months last year, there was never any problem,” Royeca explained. “It must be noted that we complied with everything that the TWG asked us to do in the initial test run. We did a re-training of all our riders. We gave our riders safety vests based on the recommendation of the TWG. We are continuously complying to the best of our abilities with the new pilot guidelines,” he revealed. Royeca also reported that in the three years since Angkas started, the Angkas app was downloaded three million times. In the course of the pilot run, they have recorded millions of rides. In terms of the service’s safety record, Angkas riders had only .003 percent accidents with zero fatalities. Angkas also has in place an Emergency Response Team and Medical Accident Network with six Emergency Medical Responder (EMR)-trained full-time employees, 42 EMR-trained biker respondents, 12 on-call doctors, and eight affiliated hospitals. During the initial pilot run, the average response time recorded was 30 minutes. Royeca also reported that Angkas has set aside an accident emergency fund to cover expenses above and beyond what’s provided by the private insurance. The company also ensures proper financial controls and standard operating procedures for quick fund disbursement for immediate patient assistance. “It took us three years and dozens of safety training sessions and hundreds of hours of training to come up with a fleet of 27,000 competent bikers. You cannot build a competent and safe biker network overnight,” Royeca shared. “We have invested so much in continuous training -- our trainors have been trained by a US firm that trains the US Marines and conducts motorcycle rider licensing and accreditation for the California and Pennsylvania State Department of Motor Vehicles. They have also undergone training with the Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group, and we are continuously working on updating and improving further our trainings,” he noted. “Moreover, I believe a support system for our bikers is necessary after they’ve passed our screening in order for them to continuously provide excellent service to our customers,” Royeca added, stating that their system averages doing assistance to 360 riders per day. In terms of training, Royeca reported that they have retrained over 20,000 bikers for the initial pilot run. They had a total of 50 field retraining activities with riders getting retrained practically every week. For six months from July to December of 2019, the safety record of Angkas was reported as 99.997 percent. “We tried our utmost best to maintain a high safety record for the benefit of all our passengers. We are proud to say that our high service standards were maintained in the test run,” he stressed. When asked about their pricing scheme, Royeca said this is for them to be able to encourage more bikers on the road to meet the demand. \"But because it is not allowed in the pilot, we will comply. We just want to give a heads up that this may result in bikers going back to habal-habal and that there'd be substantially fewer Angkas bikers on the road.” Royeca also noted that he is not against competition in the motorcycle taxi industry. \"I would like to emphasize that even back then, I knew there will be new players as soon as motorcycle taxis become the subject of legislation and regulated. I have never aspired to establish a monopoly,” he stressed. When word got out that the LTFRB will be extending the run with new players, Royeca was interviewed in the media and was reported to have said that he was totally fine with the inclusion of new players in the test run extension. “This means that people have begun to realize the importance of motorcycle taxis in helping our commuters beat the daily traffic,” he noted. In a presentation he showed during the briefing, Royeca reported that a total of 117,166 bikers have applied with Angkas. Of that number, 36,797 bikers were onboard. However, only 26,478 were retrained and activated for the first pilot run and 10,378 were deactivated. On Monday, a Mandaluyong court handed down a 72-hour temporary restraining order against the LTFRB's order, which limits the number of riders for Angkas. In a three-page order, acting Executive Judge Ofelia L. Calo of Mandaluyong City Regional Trial Court (RTC) said there is “urgency” in the issuance of the TRO against LTFRB’s move to limit Angkas’ riders to 10,000 in Manila and 3,000 in Cebu. Angkas was likewise ordered to post a PHP300,000 bond by the court. Last December 19, the LTFRB, in its own guidelines, set its cap of 30,000 riders for Metro Manila and 9,000 riders for Metro Cebu to part of the pilot implementation. Two days later, the LTFRB said hailing apps Move It and Joy Ride will be included in the revised guidelines and that the 30,000 riders limit will now be divided among the two new ride providers and Angkas or 10,000 each. Angkas then filed the suit claiming that the guidelines are \"arbitrary and unilateral\". The LTFRB has yet to respond for comment on the issue. The DOTr's TWG earlier said Angkas may be blacklisted from the country's motorcycle taxi industry after it found out that it is illegally operating in Cagayan de Oro City and that it is 99 percent owned by a certain Singaporean national Angeline Tham.

In a statement, Grab said the company wanted to revive GrabBike, its motorcycle taxi service that was once active in the country but was discontinued in mid-2016 to comply with government regulations. “As the government is seriously looking into a possible regulation for motorcycle taxis, Grab is seriously considering to reinvest in the motorcycle taxi denomination and relaunch its GrabBike service,\" the statement read. In a letter dated Dec. 9 last year and addressed to Technical Working Group for Motorcycle Taxis Chairman Antonio Gardiola Jr., Grab formally submitted its intention to join the study as “Southeast Asia’s largest and safest bike-ride hailing provider.” “In 2019, it garnered 2.55 million bike rides, with 1.49 million bike driver-partners all over Southeast Asia. Moreover, it boasts a 99.99 percent safety record which is one of the highest among Southeast Asia,” the letter read. Under the revised guidelines on the motorcycle taxi pilot study, the number of riders was capped to a total of 30,000 in Metro Manila and 9,000 in Metro Cebu, with each approved competitor allowed to have 10,000 riders each in the former and 3,000 in the latter. These competitors include one of the country’s pioneers on motorcycle taxis Angkas, and new competitors JoyRide and MoveIt. With the total riders of Angkas numbering to about 27,000, the company filed and won a temporary restraining order against the measure on Monday, which Angkas said may result in the loss of jobs for 17,000 of its riders if enforced. Earlier, the technical working group clarified that the cap on riders was set as a mere sampling size for the study and to prevent a monopoly in the motorcycle taxi market.

ACT-CIS Party-list Representative Eric Go Yap noted that Grab passengers received an amount as low as PHP1, or an average of PHP20, after the firm rolled out a refund worth PHP19.2 million as ordered by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) for overcharging violations. “Hindi makatwiran ang refund na ito. Napakaliit! Hindi tayo naniniwala na sa isang ride, wala pang piso ang maire-refund sayo. Buti sana kung sa drivers ito lahat napupunta eh (This refund is unjust. It’s too small. We don’t believe that a single ride is only less than a peso worth of refund. It would have been acceptable if everything goes to the drivers),” Yap said. “Hindi pwedeng sa bawat violation nila, refund na lang ang gagawin. Hindi lang isang beses ito nangyari noong 2019 (The penalty should not be just a refund for every violation. This [overpricing] did not just occur once in 2019),” Yap added. Yap noted that the “unfair and unjustified” pricing of Grab has been discovered during two separate monitoring periods last year. He said Grab must honor its commitment to meet the price cap, as he echoed the woes of Filipinos for its unreasonable pricing. “Sabi nila kung hindi mo kaya magbayad, huwag ka na lang mag-book ng Grab. Hindi ito issue na kung afford ba ng ordinaryong Pilipino ang presyo ng pamasahe ng Grab, ang issue rito ay kung tama ang kanilang sinisingil sa kanilang riders (They said that you shouldn’t book a Grab if you can’t afford it. But this is not an issue of whether an ordinary Filipino can afford Grab’s fares. The issue here is whether the company is charging the right price for its riders),” Yap said. The lawmaker said that aside from Grab, there are already new firms that entered the market but yet to make a significant difference in the competition. He explained that promoting competition would prevent monopoly, but letting other ride-hailing service companies to enter the market must be thoroughly studied by Congress to avoid its possible contribution to traffic congestion. Yap reiterated the need for an efficient public transport system to decrease dependence on ride-hailing applications such as Grab.

In a Facebook post on Tuesday, the LTFRB said it has called the attention of TNCs, such as Grab Philippines and Angkas regarding the matter. “According to commuters, some ride-hailing applications have started to charge higher fares since the Christmas season began, particularly this month,” the post read. “The LTFRB, in cooperation with accredited TNCs, are looking to settle this matter within the week,” it added. For his part, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said the issues will be dealt with by the LTFRB. “The agency is at the forefront of ensuring public transportation remains safe, convenient, and also affordable. We will look into this,” Delgra said. The LTFRB said these ride-hailing applications have a standard rate of PHP40 as base fare, in addition to a PHP10-15 per kilometer and PHP2 per-minute charges. During rush hour or heavy traffic, the LTFRB said TNCs are also allowed to double their per kilometer and per-minute charges through surge-pricing. Arvin Lopez, a public relations officer of Grab Philippines, said they have yet to receive an official invitation from the LTFRB but has guaranteed the company's presence should the meeting occur. “We have yet to receive the official invitation from the LTFRB on this subject, but we will definitely comply and attend to this discussion,” Lopez said in a message to reporters. In November, the LTFRB announced a review of the fare setting of Grab Philippines following a recent fine imposed on the company for overcharging. Imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), the LTFRB said the fine was due to Grab’s failure to follow through with a voluntary commitment it made with the antitrust body and had nothing to do with the policies set by the agency.

Angara filed Senate Bill 1025, which seeks to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, to allow motorcycles to be registered with the Land Transportation Office as “for hire” and may be used as a commercial vehicle to transport passengers and goods. In a statement on Thursday, he said the worsening traffic problem in Metro Manila and the frequently bogged-down mass transit systems highlight the need to provide commuters with an alternative mode of transportation, such as motorcycles-for-hire or \"habal-habal\". He, however, noted that the “increasingly-popular mode of transport” is still considered illegal under the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, which covers the registration and operation of all motor vehicles in the country. He cited the case of motorcycle ride-hailing service Angkas, which was allowed to operate for six months starting last June 8 as part of a pilot-run of \"motorcycle taxis\". “Commuting in Metro Manila has become very challenging. A typical commuter has to allocate at least two hours to get to work or school and that is if their regular modes of transport are available. What if the MRT breaks down? Kulang pa ang dalawang oras mo sa byahe (Two hours would not be enough for the commute),” Angara said. “Tulad nitong nangyari sa LRT-2 na nasunog. Libo-libong Pilipino ang naperwisyo nito at karamihan sa kanila ay habal na ang sinasakyan para mas mabilis makarating sa destinasyon nila at mas mura din ito kumpara sa Grab (Just like the fire incident in LRT-2, thousands of Filipinos were inconvenienced and most of them resorted to the use of the habal-habal as a mode of transportation to reach their destination because it’s cheaper compared to Grab),” he added. Republic Act 4136, or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, only allows the registration of motorcycles for either private or government use and prohibit its listing as a vehicle for hire. “However, individuals and even unaccredited transport groups, continue to utilize motorcycles for public transport despite (the) explicit prohibition of such operation under the same law,” Angara said. Under the bill, a motorcycle must have a minimum engine displacement of 125 cubic cm. and a backbone-type built to be registered for transporting passengers. The Land Transportation Office (LTO) will be tasked to ensure the roadworthiness of motorcycles-for-hire before they are registered. To further ensure their safety, no modifications on the motorcycles would be allowed, except for the installation, based on safe engineering design specifications, of motorcycle luggage carriers, saddlebags, step boards or footpegs, and appropriate speed limiter and monitoring device.

In a statement, Grab belied crash victim Karen Graneta's claims that she did not receive any financial aid from the firm. Grab said the case involving Graneta was pending in court. It clarified that a check worth PHP160,000 was issued to Graneta's family, specifically to her uncle, a certain Roel Capuno. The company said its chief of drivers’ services personally went to the University of Santo Tomas Hospital a day after the accident to see Graneta’s family and asked them about their needs. “At the time, Ms. Graneta’s family acknowledged that it was not the fault of the GrabCar driver, who also sustained injuries due to the accident,” the statement read. During the second visit of a Grab representative, Capuno was designated by the family to transact with Grab and was later given the check named to and personally received by him. “The family’s biggest concern at that time was the hospital expenses,” Grab said. Aside from providing financial aid, Grab said they also assisted the victim’s family in the processing of insurance claims as part of the company’s protocol. However, the family failed to comply with the requirements of the insurance claim. “Ms. Graneta’s family expressed interest to claim insurance benefits but were not able to submit the documents required for the processing of insurance claims,” Grab said. To express their willingness to extend support “above and beyond” what is necessary, Grab said they have also engaged additional third-party insurance since the accident — on top of the government-required insurance. On Wednesday, Graneta narrated the events of the 2016 collision that killed her friend, during a hearing by the Senate Committee on Public Services on the Philippine Day of Remembrance for Road Crash Victims, Survivors, and Families. Graneta and a friend were aboard a Grab car in full-stop at the Nagtahan (Mabini) bridge on Sept. 27, 2016, when a truck crashed into them from behind, causing their car to surge forward and hit another truck in front.

During a dialogue with TNVS groups and stakeholders in Quezon City, LTFRB Technical Division head Joel Bolano said some changes have been made to the current process of securing franchises known as provisional authority (PA) and certificate of public convenience (CPC) for TNVS drivers and operators. Beginning the third week of July, the LTFRB will add more hearing dates to address the huge volume of TNVS applications. “Yung isang araw, dalawang araw namin na hearing for TNVS, gagawin na po namin na three to four days. Siguraduhin lang po natin na complete requirements na po tayo (The usual one, two days hearing for TNVS will be extended to three to four days. Just make sure that the requirements are complete),” Bolano told operators during the dialogue. The move would lessen the processing time to secure papers and at the same time allow the regulator to process more applications, he added. It will also allot two Saturdays every month for follow-ups on applications for all types of transport services. Upon the acceptance of a valid and complete TNVS application, the LTFRB will automatically give a PA to operate for 90 days if the applicant has a previous application and if they provide passenger insurance and proof of garage. Bolano added that to get a PA, new applicants will also need to secure a bank certificate of conformity which is necessary for public transport as the usage of private vehicles for public service is in violation of bank rules. The streamlining came after drivers affected by the deactivation from the system of ride-hailing app Grab for failure to secure proper permits to operate in the ride-hailing industry sought for the LTFRB to reduce the process of franchise application. In the same dialogue, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said the agency was doing its best to address the concerns of TNVS groups. “On behalf of the board, humihingi ako ng paumanhin (I ask for forgiveness). And that’s precisely why we are addressing it. We’re trying to find ways to address this,” Delgra said. On Saturday, the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA) stepped in and arranged dialogues between leaders of the TNVS community, the LTFRB and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) after complaints of red-tape were filed against the LTFRB by TNVS drivers and operators. The LTFRB did not participate in the first two dialogues but arranged a third dialogue after a transport holiday by the TNVS community last Monday. Lawyer Ariel Inton, president of Lawyers for Commuters Safety and Protection, expressed satisfaction with some of the changes that the regulator presented to them. “Yung sa proseso, ito ay magiging mas madali. At yung mga requirements ay mabawasan. In fairness to the board, madami sila pinakita na pagbabago na gagawin nila sa proseso,” Inton said. Janina Pineda, president of the TNVS group Road Grabbers, said even though the dialogue took about six hours with no breaks, the opportunity given to members of their community to air their grievances was worth it but its results are yet to be seen. “Lahat ng operator nagkaroon ng chance na mag-speak up regarding their concern (All operators got a chance to speak up regarding their concern). Most concerns are ongoing for a board of directors meeting so we’ll wait within this week for updates,” Pineda said. But Jun de Leon, leader of the Metro Manila Hatchback Community and Laban TNVS, expressed his dissatisfaction after the regulator stood their ground on prohibiting hatchback operators and drivers from becoming licensed TNVS. “Hindi naman dialogue yung nangyari dito, 'yung gusto pa rin nila ang nasunod.

HPG chief, Brig. Gen. Roberto Fajardo said their mandate is to ensure the safety of the metro’s highways for the benefit of commuters and motorists alike and part of that mandate is to help ensure the smooth and safe flow of traffic in our streets. “We support Angkas, as well as all the transport operators legally franchised by the LTFRB, because it is a service that helps the commuters in safely going to and from their destinations. The HPG and Angkas have the same objective and therefore we need to support each other,” Fajardo told reporters during the press briefing for the turnover of Angkas’ donation of 50 brand-new, high-quality helmets to the HPG, which was held at the HPG office in Camp Crame, Quezon City. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) recently gave the green light to implement the pilot run of Angkas in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu for six months starting this June. Prior to this, the DOTr organized a Technical Working Group to discuss and conduct studies of Angkas’ operations, particularly its safety training program for their motorcycle rider-partners. The pilot run aims to assess the safety level of motorcycle taxis and was recommended by a technical working group created by DOTr to study the issue of legalizing motorcycles as public utility vehicles. Fajardo said that Angkas bikers have also been participating in the HPG’s own Motorcycle Riders Safety training program. “In their own little way, and in line with Angkas’ social responsibility, they send their own riders to join our safety training,” Fajardo noted. He also commended Angkas’ own safety training program. “Maganda nga ang may training dahil magiging katuwang natin sila, magiging example of a disciplined motorcycle rider,” Fajardo stressed. Fajardo also described the HPG’s partnership with Angkas as a joint effort to work for the benefit of the commuters and the motorists. “We work hand in hand for the safety, security and discipline of the motorists,” he stressed. Fajardo also said that the donated helmets will be part of the HPG riders’ new uniform and will be the perfect tandem for the new BMW motorcycles that the HPG riders will soon be driving. Angkas founder and CEO Angeline Tham talked about their partnership with HPG, saying, “HPG is out every day protecting our streets and since safety is also paramount to Angkas, we join them in their effort to make the street safer for the general public.” According to Angkas Regulatory and Public Affairs head George Royeca, the donation is part of their safety advocacy. “Have always been vocal about the company’s advocacy for the safety of both the bikers and the passengers. Our donation to the HPG is in line with that advocacy, and which we hope will, in some way, contribute to the safety of our friends from the HPG as they patrol our highways and make them safe,” Royeca said. “This is just the start of a partnership with HPG which we hope will expand to cover other areas that promote and improve road safety,” he added. Angkas will retrain its 27,000 accredited biker-partners through rigorous riding skills assessments, written tests, and extensive safety training to ensure they meet very high safety standards in preparation for the pilot operation. It intends to train 2,000 drivers a day. “Currently, we have retrained 12,000 drivers so we still need to train additional 15,000 more to fully train the 27,000 before we can launch the pilot,” said Angkas operations head David Medrana. The company will provide special reflectorized vests with side straps to help bikers become more visible at night and aid passengers in holding on to the biker’s waist. Each vest has the biker’s unique ID number ensuring that only officially-registered bikers can take ride bookings. All Angkas biker-partners and their passengers are also insured for every ride. A feedback mechanism is also installed on its mobile app to closely monitor the performance of drivers and quickly address passenger concerns. Royeca hopes that Congress will be able to pass a law that will legalize motorcycle taxis after the six-month pilot run. “I think even before the six months are over, we hope to refile the bill in Congress and in Senate. We hope to have a very healthy dialogue with the committee on public services in Senate and the committee on transportation in Congress so that we can update them on a regular basis on the operations of the pilot program,” Royeca said. The motorcycle ridesharing firm assured passengers that it will not impose fare increases amid the implementation of its safety features. Motorcycle taxis shall have a fare of PHP50 for the first two kilometers, an additional PHP10 per kilometer until seven kilometers, additional PHP15 for succeeding kilometers, and a surge rate cap of 1.5x in Metro Manila based on the guidelines set by the DOTr. The initial charge will be PHP20 for the first kilometer, an additional PHP20 per kilometer up to eight kilometers, and PHP20 per kilometer for destinations beyond eight kilometers in Metro Cebu.

In a statement Friday, Secretary Arthur Tugade has approved the guidelines for the pilot implementation of motorcycle ride-hailing services such as Angkas following its recommendation by a technical working group (TWG) which was created by the department to review the issue of allowing motorcycles as a form of public transportation. The TWG consisting of the DOTr, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, Land Transportation Office, Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group, Metro Manila Development Authority, and representatives of the Senate, House of Representatives, commuter welfare groups, road safety advocates, motorcycle manufacturers, motorcycle organizations and law schools. “Our approval of the pilot implementation of the motorcycle taxi operations is proof that the government is listening to and addresses the woes, concerns and suggestions of our riding public,” Tugade said. The DOTr created the TWG last December which crafted the general guidelines for the implementation of the pilot run. The transportation chief reminded motorcycle ride-hailing firms to strictly adhere to safety requirements on their operations. Among these requirements are the required wearing of safety gears like helmet, reflectorized vest and vest-based strap or belt; compliance to speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour; proper maintenance of their motorcycle and wearing the appropriate driver’s uniform. Riders must render a maximum of 10 hours of service per day and accident insurance should be provided in an amount which is the same or higher than the Passenger Personal Accident Insurance Program for public utility vehicles. Motorcycle taxis shall have a fare of PHP50 for the first two kilometers, an additional PHP10 per kilometer until seven kilometers, additional PHP15 for succeeding kilometer, and a surge rate cap of 1.5x in Metro Manila. For Metro Cebu, the initial charge will be PHP20 for the first kilometer, an additional PHP20 per kilometer up to eight kilometers, and PHP20 per kilometer for destinations beyond eight kilometers. Motorcycle taxis must only operate through their ride-hailing app platform. A comprehensive data should likewise be submitted to the DOTr to include all incidents of road crash, passenger complaints, trip details and fares collected. The transportation department has also set key performance indicators which include accident threshold, reporting of traffic violations and feedback from regular passengers. “If the total number of major or minor accidents for the duration of the pilot run reaches 5 percent, we will call for an emergency TWG, which will be followed up by an investigation and an appropriate action which may or may not include the suspension of the pilot implementation,” the DOTr statement read. The implementation of the pilot run will serve as the basis for Senator JV Ejercito’s Senate Bill No. 2180 which will allow the use of motorcycles as public utility vehicles. Meanwhile, Angkas said it welcomes the decision of the DOTr to approve the pilot run of the motorcycle taxis and urged legislators to pass a measure allowing motorcycles to operate as a mode of public transportation. “The pilot seeks to aid Congress in its efforts to legislate a proper motorcycle taxi bill, which is now undergoing revisions in the Senate. We hope that the Angkas pilot will serve to show legislators and regulators the viability of this mode of transport so we can fully pass it into a law,” said Angkas Chief Executive Officer Angeline Tham in a separate statement. Motorcycles are currently prohibited to operate as public transport services under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation Code. In December 2018, the Supreme Court (SC) issued a temporary restraining order in favor of the DOTr and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) seeking to stop the operations of Angkas run by DBDOYC Inc. The High Court's order voided a September 2018 ruling issued by the Mandaluyong City Regional Trial Court in favor of Angkas.

Jimenez is optimistic that the voters’ participation will be encouraging specifically with their partnership with the private company. “There is room to believe to be cautiously optimistic that we will have higher turns out than expected and in addition to that, of course the activation of voters when they ride Grab vehicles through this voter education campaign will drive up that number even more,” Jimenez said. “Marami sa mga botante na nagdedesisyon lamang na bumoto sila on election day (There will be a lot of people who will decide to vote on election day),\" Jimenez added. Comelec data shows that the voter turnout in the 2010 polls was 74 percent while it was 77 percent in the 2013 election. On the other hand, the #OneDestination campaign, a tie-up between the Comelec and Grab, aims to encourage Filipinos particularly registered voters to participate in the May 13 polls. Under the partnership, Grab will provide PHP50 discount to Metro Manila and Metro Cebu passengers when they go to the polling centers using the Grabshare discount code “ONEDESTINATION.” Selected Grab car units will also have car stickers and flyers to be distributed to their passengers. “As Grab, our role goes behind providing safe, seamless, and reliable services to our customers, but to also cultivate a sense of community and unity among our users. Through this campaign, we aim to inspire voter’s confidence and trust in the voting system, and move the Philippines forward to one destination, together,” said Brian Cu, president of Grab Philippines.

The ridesharing firm explained that the new policy aims to reduce unreasonable cancellations by both drivers and passengers. “Grab is mindful that cancellations are frustrating for both the passengers and our drivers. At the same time, we are cognizant of the fact that sometimes, cancellations are necessary during special situations. Our intention in implementing this new policy is to create a better ride-hailing ecosystem, where both passengers and drivers practice the responsible use of the Grab platform,” Grab President Brian Cu said in a statement on Monday. Starting Monday, a PHP 50 cancellation fee will be charged to passengers who cancel the ride after 5 minutes of getting assigned a driver and a PHP 50 no show-up fee if a passenger did not show up at the pick-up point within 5 minutes for GrabCar and 3 minutes for GrabShare upon the driver’s arrival. The cancellation fee will be applied on the next ride booking of a passenger if they paid in cash and will be paid to the driver to reimburse fuel costs and time spent for traveling to the destination point of the rider. A passenger’s account could be suspended for 24 hours if they cancel rides twice in an hour, thrice in a day or a total of 5 cancellations per week. Drivers will also be locked out of the platform for a temporary period of time if they forced passengers to cancel ride bookings without any reason and for being selective of passenger destinations. Grab clarified that fees will not be imposed for the following situations: - Passenger cancels within 5 minutes of getting an assigned driver. - The driver is not moving towards the pick-up point or going to the wrong direction. - Driver takes 15 minutes longer than the first estimated time of arrival. - The driver indicates that he/she has arrived when he/she has not. The firm assured that it will refund any fees that were charged wrongly within 48 hours, when reported via their in-app Help Centre. The new policy will be implemented on a staggered basis for both riders and passengers and is expected to be completed by the end of May. “We will be implementing this initially to the first 10 percent of the riders and drivers with its full implementation set by end May. We will be rolling out official communications for passengers and drivers starting this Monday,” Grab public relations manager Krhizzy Pasigan said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency. The company has notified the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board on the new policy. Ride-hailing firm Uber used to impose a PHP 100 cancellation fee to passengers that cancel rides more than five minutes after a booking is made before its ride-hailing operations in the country were halted in April last year due to its acquisition by Grab.

In a statement on Friday, LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III said Go Jek’s local subsidiary, Velox Philippines, violated the provision under the 1987 Constitution - which states that companies in the country should be 60 percent owned by Filipinos. “We need to follow the 60-40 requirement of the law for TNCs to operate in the country,” Delgra said. The Board affirmed the decision of its pre-accreditation committee, which denied the application of Velox Philippines. The committee noted that only 20.4 percent of the 1.2 billion common shares of Velox Philippines’ parent company, Velox South-East Asia Holdings Pte. Ltd. was actually sold to local shareholder Pace Crimson Ventures Corporation (PCVC) based on its Deed of Absolute Sale of Shares of Stock. The LTFRB said Velox Philippines has failed to show proof of payment of its capital gains tax on the shares allegedly sold, and proof of payment of shares allegedly subscribed by the PCVC under its subscription agreement. The Department of Transportation (DOTr), meanwhile, said it did not interfere in the accreditation process of Go-Jek. “The DOTr does not intervene with the decision of the LTFRB during that phase of deliberation. If Velox Philippines wishes to appeal, they can do so before the DOTr, through the Franchising Review Staff,” Undersecretary for Road Transport Mark de Leon said.

This, as the DOTr reiterated that amendments to Republic Act (RA) No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code are needed to allow motorcycles to operate as public transport. The law prohibits motorcycles from operating as public transportation services. “The DOTr has maintained that the best recourse for conversion of motorcycle taxis to public transport is amendment of the law. In fact, this lack of an enabling law is best reiterated by the various proposed bills in the House (of Representatives) and the Senate seeking to allow motorcycle taxis to operate as a public transport mode,” the department said in a statement on Saturday. Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade has ordered the creation of a technical working group (TWG) to review the issue of allowing motorcycles for public transportation. The TWG was mandated to conduct deliberations on various issues covering the capability of motorcycles and drivers for public transport service, which include determining the types of motorcycle that can be awarded a franchise, the minimum cubic centimeter (CC) capacity, travel speed, franchise routes, seat and helmet requirements, and training requirements for motorcycle bikers looking to register as a public utility vehicle driver. “Much as it understands the perspective of some lawmakers on the issue of motorcycle taxis operating as public transport, the DOTr also seeks public understanding as its TWG threshes out the numerous concerns involved in the proposal, foremost of which is commuter safety,” the DOTr said. Various lawmakers have called on the DOTr to issue a department order (DO) that would allow motorcycle ride-hailing firms to provide public transport to passengers. They have noted that the transportation department has issued an order in 2015, which introduced the category of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) that allowed private vehicles under transportation network companies to operate as public transportation. The DOTr said issuing a DO to legalize motorcycles-for-hire should be based on existing laws. “According to Republic Act 4136 (Land Transportation and Traffic Code), passenger automobiles may be classified as either private or public (‘for hire’), depending on its purpose. Thus, although TNVS units were initially classified as private vehicles, their transition to public transport only required a conversion to another classification. On the other hand, RA 4136 clearly does not allow motorcycles to be classified as ‘for hire’ or for public utility,” the department’s statement read. The DOTr said that issuance of a DO will violate the temporary restraining order issued by the Supreme Court against motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas to halt its operations last December, which might lead to filing of contempt charges against transportation officials. “The DOTr wishes to reiterate that it does not intend to antagonize Angkas. In fact, the DOTr has welcomed motorcycle groups in TWG discussions to thresh out the requirements and other contingent issues. These issues are ultimately directed at regulation for passenger safety and nothing else,” it said. The TWG, consisting of the DOTr, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Land Transportation Office, Philippine National Police - Highway Patrol Group, Metro Manila Development Authority, and representatives of the Senate, House of Representatives, commuter welfare groups, road safety advocates, motorcycle manufacturers, motorcycle organizations and law schools, has started its deliberations last January 18. The group will submit a report on its deliberations to Congress as inputs for lawmakers to decide on the proposed amendments to RA 4136. The House has approved on second reading a bill that will allow motorcycles to provide public transport earlier this week. House Bill No. 8959 or the Motorcycles for Hire Act will authorize the LTFRB to legalize the operation of motorcycles as public utility vehicles. Under the bill, motorcycles must be registered and granted a certificate of public convenience or special permit by the LTFRB.

PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said the commission was able to monitor violations of Grab with its pricing commitments over the period from August 10 to November 10 last year. “The monitoring team of the PCC found that there were certain inconsistencies and inaccuracies with the data that was provided as it relates to the price monitoring commitment. Suffice it to say that this prevented the monitor and the PCC monitoring team from carrying out its review of the pricing commitments in an effective way, which results in an unbiased and credible outcome. In that sense, we’ve thought that reviewing the undertaking of Grab, this ran counter to specific procedures of that undertaking,” Bernabe said. The PCC has approved the acquisition of Uber by Grab on Aug. 10, 2018 following the submission of the voluntary commitments by the ride-hailing company. Its voluntary commitments include the improvement of the quality of its service by bringing back market averages for acceptance and cancellation rates, which existed before the merger happened, and its response time to rider complaints. Grab fares shall likewise not have an “extraordinary deviation” from the minimum allowed fares that are set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The PCC has appointed United Kingdom-based auditing firm Smith & Williamson to monitor the compliance of Grab with its voluntary commitments on a quarterly basis for a period of one year. The commission also slapped a PHP16-million penalty on Grab last October for violating the interim measures it has imposed during the review period of their deal with Uber. Meanwhile, Grab said it will file a motion for reconsideration against the fine imposed by the PCC. In its statement, the firm said it wants to determine the rationale for PCC to impose the maximum penalty. “We assure our passengers that we are charging fares within the range as allowed by the LTFRB,” Grab said in the statement. The PCC issued the fine against Grab last January 22 with the company receiving the notice on January 23. Grab has to submit the necessary data within five days of the receipt of order, which will be on January 28. The firm has until February 7 to file its motion for reconsideration on the imposed penalty.

In a comment filed before the High Court Thursday, DBDOYC Inc., Angkas' mother firm urged the SC to lift the restraining order (TRO) issued by its second division last December 5. The TRO had been granted upon the request of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The LTFRB stopped the operations of Angkas in November last year due to lack of necessary franchise to operate and ruled that the operator should secure franchise from Congress to operate as a public utility vehicle under the Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. The company also sought the dismissal of the petition of LTFRB and Department of Transportation challenging the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court (RTC) last August which stopped the government's apprehension of Angkas riders. It asked the SC to instead affirm the injunction order of the lower court that prohibited the government's transport agencies \"from interfering, whether directly or indirectly\" with Angkas' operations. The Mandaluyong RTC order prevented authorities \"from apprehending Angkas bikers who are in lawful pursuit of their trade or occupation based on petitioner's Angkas mobile application; and from performing any act or acts that will impede, obstruct, frustrate, or defeat [the] petitioner's pursuit of its lawful business or trade as owner and operator of the Angkas mobile application.\" (PNA)"},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1056589","title":"LTFRB to run after Angkas in Cebu","date":" December 13, 2018, 8:29 pm","snippet":"CEBU CITY – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) 7 (Central Visayas) will start apprehending Angkas riders, who will take passengers despite the Supreme Court (SC) ruling restraining a lower court order blocking authorities from apprehending the app-based ride-hailing motorcycles.","body":"CEBU CITY – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) 7 (Central Visayas) will start apprehending Angkas riders, who will take passengers despite the Supreme Court (SC) ruling restraining a lower court order blocking authorities from apprehending the app-based ride-hailing motorcycles. This, as Mayor Tomas Osmeña said Thursday the SC ruling against Angkas is detrimental to the people here where there is no alternative mode of transportation that can serve them, except for motorcycles locally called as “habal-habal.” LTFRB-7 chief Eduardo Montealto Jr. said they will include in their operation the apprehension of “habal-habals” operating in various mountain barangays in Cebu. “From the beginning, the practice of taking passengers using a motorcycle for a fee has been illegal,” he said. Montealto said \"habal-habals\" in the mountain barangays, and even the urban-version Angkas, have no franchise from the government. Under the law, any vehicle that takes passengers for a fee without a permit is illegal and referred to as “colorum”. The lives of passengers taking Angkas are at risk, the LTFRB-7 chief said. Montealto said it is the mandate of the LTFRB to arrest colorum vehicles, including \"habal-habal\" and Angkas. Land Transportation Office-7 chief Victor Caindec told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) that they are waiting for a directive from their central office in Manila, following the high tribunal’s decision against Angkas. He, however, said his office is willing to assist LTFRB-7 in apprehending \"habal-habals\" and Angkas operating in the region, particulary in Cebu City where their illegal operation is tolerated by the local government unit. On his social media post, however, Osmeña said “habal-habals, especially in the mountain barangays, are simply a fact of life because no alternative means of transportation exists.” He said even in the urban areas, “there is a shortage of public rides.” \"Habal-habals are used because for many, they are simply the most practical way to get around. What Angkas did is take the shortcomings of habal habals and improve upon them,” the mayor’s post read. According to the mayor, Angkas made the passengers “safer by making drivers identifiable and requiring drivers to provide clean helmets to passengers and install speed limiters in their bikes.” Osmeña also reacted to the issue on overpricing of fare rate being collected by Angkas riders. “They reduced overpricing. They even helped with the traffic by allowing direct pickups instead of having all the bikes wait by the street,\" he added. \"Without 'habal-habals', the majority living in Cebu City’s two dozen mountain barangays will have no means of transportation,” he said. “We are also exploring the legality of an LGU producing it’s own Angkas-like program to make up for the loss of Angkas. We will do everything we can to benefit the public good.” On Wednesday, the high court issued a temporary restraining order against a decision of the Regional Trial Court Branch 213 in Mandaluyong that barred authorities from apprehending drivers operating under Angkas. Department of Transportation (DOTr) Communications Director Goddes Liberan said in a report that the department has welcomed the high tribunal’s decision, saying “it is in line with our efforts to prioritize the safety and security of the riding public through proper implementation of the law.” (PNA)"},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1056609","title":"LTFRB starts crackdown vs. Angkas bikers ","date":" December 13, 2018, 7:40 pm","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Thursday began apprehending bikers of the motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas, following the decision of Supreme Court to suspend its operations.","body":"MANILA -- The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Thursday began apprehending bikers of the motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas, following the decision of Supreme Court to suspend its operations.

Our goal is to provide a full spectrum of transportation solutions with localized and modernized services for everyday needs, no matter what vehicle they prefer or how short their journey is,” Cu said. “Through our combined efforts with AutoItalia Philippines, we hope to work with LGUs (local government units) to improve short-distance commute in more cities in the Philippines while improving driver welfare and passenger experience,” he added. The municipality of Binalonan in Pangasinan province will be the first local government in the country to adopt the premium tricycle services with 24 Piaggo Ape units. Around 2,000 Euro-4 compliant Piaggo Ape vehicles will be deployed in the country, according to the ride-hailing firm. Grab and AutoItalia Philippines will be coordinating with LGUs, which has jurisdiction over the franchises of tricycles, to adopt the use of Piaggio Apé units either by increasing the number of franchises or by using them as a replacement option for older tricycles.

Binalonan is the third local government to partner with Grab service after Pampanga province and Balanga in Bataan province. “This is advantageous to both tricycle drivers and passengers. Anywhere you are, you can book a ride. For the driver, he can have a passenger anytime. Grab Trike Binalonan operates 24/7, meaning a passenger is assured of a tricycle ride anytime of the day,” Guico said. “Just like a ‘Grab Taxi’, the fare is fixed and it is up to the passenger if he wants to give a tip.” He dispelled rumors that the new system would deprive other TODA tricycles of their livelihood, clarifying it is one way of increasing their income. They are welcome to register, he added. Grab representatives, led by city operations and expansion head Gines Barot, were present during the launch. “We are excited to bring the service of Grab here,” Barot said, calling Grab Trike a “door-to-door” tricycle service. Grab Trike operators, who must be legitimate tricycle franchise holders, are required to submit the standard OR/CR, NBI clearance, and police clearance. The driver should have a smart phone. Both Guico and Barot said only minute details of the operation need to be finalized, such as the booking fee. The soft launch began in the morning with a short program in front of the municipal hall.

Grab may be able to file a motion for reconsideration within 15 days upon issuance of the order and may appeal to the Department of Transportation (DOTr) in case this was denied, according to the LTFRB. In its statement, the ride-hailing firm said that the per minute charge was in accordance with Department Order 2015-011 and that this is still valid. “This DO is valid despite the position of the LTFRB to the contrary. LTFRB has no authority to declare DOTr order invalid.

Grab also said the per minute fare was also part of the presentation and discussions during its technical working group meeting with the LTFRB on July 2017 and that the LTFRB Chairman was also informed of the fare structure. “We likewise received an e-mail response from the Office of the Chairman. No concerns were raised by the Board at that time,” it said. However, Delgra said an e-mail response from his office cannot be seen as approval of the fare structure. “The Board is going to decide as to whether we are going to grant a fare increase or not. It’s the Board who’s going to decide, and that’s basically what happened to the taxi fare, to the PUJ,” he said. The Board earlier said there was no mention of any travel time rate, which Grab has been collecting, when it released its order on the fare structure of TNCs in Dec. 27, 2016, which stipulates that the company should impose a flagdown rate of PHP40 with an additional rate of PHP10 to PHP14 per kilometer excluding per-minute travel charges. In its order dated July 9, the LTFRB said the rebates will be availed only for 20 days from the time the decision becomes final or when Grab shall start its implementation whichever is earlier. The amount of the rebate is limited to the portion of the income of Grab which is directly related to the PHP2-per minute charge during the period of its imposition. The per-minute charge was imposed by Grab from June 2, 2017 until Apr. 19, 2018 when it was suspended by the LTFRB. The DOTr has issued an order last June 11, authorizing the LTFRB to determine the fare, rates and other charges of TNCs after undergoing public hearings and consultations to ensure that they are just and reasonable. This will ensure that the TNCs will comply with policies, laws, and regulations as the DOTr recognizes their role in providing transport services to the public.

The subsidy program, which the company rolled out last June 19, aims to ensure sustainable income for its drivers while meeting the demand for rides from its passengers. “We have provided around PHP70 million for over two weeks. Almost lahat affected (Almost everybody was affected) and they will be given subsidies,” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launch of its Smart City initiative in Makati City. “The reason why we shifted to subsidies from incentives is that we saw that a lot of drivers who are driving part-time do not hit incentives anyway. May mga trips na nalulugi sila (They have trips wherein they are losing money). The subsidies ensure that the assistance for driver income occurs on a more broad basis. Rather than a few getting a lot, there are now a lot getting enough,” he added. Grab earlier said the earnings of its drivers have declined since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board suspended the PHP2-per-minute travel charge last April. Ideally, TNVS drivers should be earning at least PHP5.50 per minute or PHP330 per hour, according to the ride-hailing firm. Grab is eyeing to spend more than PHP100 million a month for the fare subsidy, which will be based on the duration of riding hours of passengers and will ensure that drivers get the ideal fare rate as computed by its system. The ride-hailing firm is also seeking for the migration of about 6,000 drivers to its platform, who were displaced following the halt of the operations of its corporate rival, Uber. Grab makes some 600,000 bookings nationwide per day, which increase up to 800,000 during peak hours, while TNVS supply in its platform remains at 33,000. Meanwhile, the firm is eyeing to implement a multimodal transportation system, wherein its TNVS units will be integrated into other modes of public transportation. This will provide a variety of choices for transportation by commuters as they go to their destinations. “The idea for us here in the Philippines is to take away cars traveling along congested roads and move them into higher capacity vehicles, like shuttles and buses,” Cu said. The Grab official said the company is coordinating with transport regulators to provide a free hand in franchising shuttles and other modes of transportation. “We are now meeting with P2P bus operators to see how we can use them as mid-mile while we provide the first and last mile form of transportation, either by cars or trikes,” he said. Grab hopes that this initiative would help encourage passengers to use public transportation to ease the traffic congestion in Metro Manila.

Grab is expected to spend more than PHP100 million a month for the fare subsidy as it ensures to provide proper income to drivers of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) for them to earn a decent living while assuring that trips are still affordable to passengers. “Based on our computations, a TNVS driver needs to make at least PHP330 per hour to be able to properly provide for his family’s needs and to cope with the traffic, high fuel and vehicle maintenance costs,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Tuesday. “Since PHP2-per-minute component was suspended, we received a lot of painful complaints from our partners that their earnings are not sufficient anymore to make a decent living. That’s why we decided to step in,” he added. Ideally, TNVS drivers should be earning at least PHP5.50 per minute or PHP330 per hour, according to the ride-hailing firm. The fare subsidy will be based on the duration of riding hours of passengers and will ensure that drivers will get the ideal fare rate as computed by Grab’s system. “For example, if a ride from Makati to BGC (Bonifacio Global City) takes an hour because of heavy traffic despite short distance and fare is computed at PHP120 only. Grab will return to the driver the PHP210 difference to make sure he made PHP330 for that one hour trip. The subsidy will run as long as it’s needed and for as long as we have resources to do so,” Cu said. Grab is making an average of 600,000 bookings that increases up to 800,000 during peak hours while TNVS supply in its platform remains at 33,000. The firm has earlier said that it is seeking for the migration of about 6,000 drivers to its platform, who were displaced following the halt of Uber’s operations last April.

The increase in Grab’s operating costs was attributed to revenues from the 20 percent commission from rides that are being used for driver incentives.

This information is contained in the Statement of Concerns (SOC) report on the Grab-Uber deal done by PCC’s Mergers and Acquisition Office (MAO) released to the press Monday. The antitrust body through its report, reiterated that the acquisition of Uber by Grab has resulted in a \"substantial lessening of competition\" in the ride-hailing market. But the review also found out that “an overwhelming majority of riders” would still continue using on-demand car-based private transportation online booking service via mobile ride-hailing application despite a 5 to 10 percent increase, “which is borne out by actual events of post-transaction”. It was also noted that there are key qualitative differences between TNVS and other modes of public transportation. Moreover, the PCC stated in the SOC that in the aftermath of the merger, Grab now controls 93 percent of TNVS registered vehicles, solidifying its unrivaled dominance in the relevant market. Despite the increase in supply of drivers after the deal, Grab fares have continued to increase. “This upward trend in price is apparent through the higher fares and increased frequency of surge-pricing applied by grab,” the SOC read. “The review indicated that prior to the transaction, prices charged by Grab have been flat to declining, while post-transaction prices have been increasing, despite the supply of drivers available to Grab post-transaction,” it added. The Commission also cited the declining quality of service of Grab after the transaction, which include increased driver cancellation, forced cancellations of rides, and increased waiting time. “This is compounded by the loss of a competitor in Uber where trips were likely less to be cancelled due to features which mask the destination of a prospective rider until the start of a trip,” the SOC noted. PCC’s issuance of SOC is part of its motu proprio review on the Grab-Uber deal launched on April 3. The Commission has given the parties time to file their comments on the SOC. The PCC earlier said that based on its review, the Commission has the power to approve or block the deal. But the parties can also give their commitments and remedies to address the anti-competitive concerns of the PCC.

In its petition filed before the Board dated May 18, Grab said the suspension by the Board of the per minute fare has infringed the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution as it has allowed other transportation network companies (TNCs) to impose similar charges prejudicing their operations. “The Honorable Board’s assailed Order dated 19 April 2018 suspending the petitioner’s imposition of its per minute charge as a component of its fare structure violates petitioner’s right to equal protection of the law since while the Honorable Board suspended such fee imposition by the petitioner, it has allowed other transportation network companies to include the same per minute charge in their respective fare structures,” Grab's petition read. The LTFRB has approved the accreditations of ride-hailing firms Hype Transport Systems Inc., Hirna Mobility Solutions Inc., Go Lag, Owto and MiCab Systems Corporation following the halt of the operations of Uber as a result of its acquisition by Grab last month. According to Grab, the Board has approved the fare structures of these new TNCs allowing them to impose per minute charges to their riders. The suspension will enable drivers and operators belonging to the common supply base which was imposed by the LTFRB to transfer to other TNCs as they are allowed to impose per minute charges, the firm said. “It is clear that members of the Honorable Board who issued the order suspending the per minute charge of the petitioner have caused undue injury and prejudice to the petitioner,” its petition read. The firm also said that the filing of a motion for reconsideration will render the LTFRB’s suspension order not executory. \"Since the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration by the petitioner on April 20, 2018 has the effect of staying the April 19, 2018 order, petitioner then has the legal authority to resume the imposition of the P2-per-minute charge pending the resolution of the motion,\" Grab said. The firm has said that it has the authority to formulate their own fare structures in accordance with the Department Order 2015-11 of the then Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC). The LTFRB has suspended Grab’s per minute charge following the allegations raised by PBA Partylist Rep. Jericho Nograles that Grab is illegally charging PHP2-per-minute for their rides, on top of its flagdown rate of PHP40 and charging PHP10 to PHP14 per kilometer. Grab should refund around PHP 1.8 billion to its customers because of the alleged overcharging, Nograles added.

For sure, we can implement it for credit card users. The challenge we encounter is for riders paying in cash,” Grab country marketing head Cindy Toh said in a press conference in Makati City on Tuesday. “When Uber was implementing it, there was friction between drivers in terms of connecting. We are reviewing that and will be rolling it out as soon as we have the solution,” Toh added. Uber used to charge a fee on riders who cancel trips, which they will have to pay on their next trip, before its ride-hailing operations in the country were halted last April due to its acquisition by Grab. Grab is imposing a maximum cancellation of one trip per day as part of incentives for its drivers. Currently, its drivers cancel 8 percent of their trips while passengers cancel 12 percent of their rides. The ridesharing company seeks to reduce the rate of driver cancellation by 4 percent, and passenger cancellation by 6 percent under its 100-day plan to improve driver behavior and welfare, provide better ride experience, and upgrade customer support. Under the initiative, Grab will enhance the performance incentives it offers to drivers to motivate them to provide quality services to its riders. Top performing drivers will be rewarded based on their number of rides, high rating, and good feedback from passengers. Grab is also considering to implement a breakdown on its fares to ensure transparency of its operations. “We are working already a breakdown of the fare on the receipt. I have a team that is working on revising the receipt that you get. On the new receipt, you should be able to see the surge rate and the base fare, how many kilometers traveled. That is already a work in progress,” Toh said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launch of the campaign. “We just have tech constraints. We will be rolling it out. Our target is this will also be implemented within the 100 days,” she said. Grab implemented the masking of passenger destinations last April 27, which was initially rolled out to 25 percent of Grab drivers with historically low acceptance rate. It has also activated an auto-accept feature that will automatically allocate trips to drivers allowing a more seamless experience in continuously accepting passenger requests. Grab has maintained that the main reason for the difficulty in booking a ride is the lack of cars, resulting in low supply. The company is appealing to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to increase the supply cap of 65,000 transportation network vehicle service units in Metro Manila. Grab said that it receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests per day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve its riders. The suspension of the PHP2-per-minute travel charge by the LTFRB has caused a shortage in the supply of vehicles, leading to longer waiting time or non-allocation of rides according to the firm.

To improve driver behavior, Grab will implement an improved Driver Code of Conduct (COC), a set of updated rules and regulations that will stipulate the tasks and traits of a responsible Grab driver-partner. Drivers must comply with the COC for them to continue access to the Grab app. A Driver Academy will also be established that will provide modules on road courtesy, customer service and data privacy and social media handling on top of driver onboarding and rehabilitation training services. Grab drivers will also be qualified for perks such as discounted gas prices, driver lounge and maintenance discounts under the company’s rewards program. Passenger will be able to expect a new app interface for iOS and Android by July. The new app will enable them to easily set their pick-up points and quickly select their preferred service. Rewards will also be categorized for easier selection and redemption of offers. Grab is urging its riders to utilize the Help Center to report their concerns as well as their location issues particularly pick-up and drop off points. The ride-hailing firm will also partner with a BPO company to upgrade its customer service team which will be operational by July. Dedicated service lines for passengers, drivers and platinum users will allow easier access to after-ride services. “We hope that with these new improvements, our driver-partners will continue to be good and responsible members of the TNVS (transportation network vehicle services) community and enablers of better journeys,” Toh said. “Our aim is to be our passengers’ partner for better trips at all times.

With the recent suspension of PHP2-per-minute fare, a lot of drivers and operators fear they won’t be able to provide for their families and car maintenance expenses,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Wednesday. The company said that it receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests per day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve its riders. Grab has 24,000 vehicles serving 60 percent to 65 percent of bookings while Uber had 19,000 vehicles and a success rate of 50 percent before the acquisition of its operations. Of the 19,000 active Uber vehicles, only 11,000 have moved to Grab. Majority of the gap is due to the 6,000 active Uber drivers who could no longer continue driving as they were not part of LTFRB’s audited master list. As a result, only 53 percent of passengers are able to get a ride on their first booking attempt, but this goes down to as low as 37 percent on average during peak hours. To address the gap in the supply of TNVS units across the country, Cu said they will need the collaboration of transport regulators and ride-hailing companies. \"With an average of 12 rides a day, this is already an additional 72,000 rides, which can help ease the plight of the riders,” Cu said. In the meantime, Grab is advising its riders to utilize the GrabShare feature on its app to maximize the use of its available vehicles through sharing rides with other passengers. It will also review its incentives structure to enable its drivers to efficiently deliver services to the passengers. For its part, the LTFRB said it is open to a possible review of the supply cap it has imposed on TNVS units as it has approved accreditations for new transportation network companies (TNCs). “We need to see the churning rates of TNCs -- how many operators were blacklisted and how many drivers are no longer operating. These are the things that are unique to the TNCs.

Grab maintained that the travel duration rate is legal and in accordance with a 2015 order of the Department of Transportation that allows transportation network companies (TNCs) to set their own fare rates. In a statement Thursday, Country Head Brian Cu said drivers would not earn a sustainable income and would be forced to quit their jobs as transport network vehicle services operators if the PHP2-per-minute charge is stopped, resulting in fewer vehicles for passengers. This will lead to longer waiting time for the riders, causing fare prices to increase drastically while other passengers from far locations may be left unallocated, Cu added. He said 80 percent of the travel duration charge goes to the driver while 20 percent is used for driver incentives and passenger promos. Grab had presented its fare structure, including the PHP2-per-minute charge, in a technical working group meeting with the LTFRB in July 2017, after imposing the charge the previous month. In its order dated April 18, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said the suspension stands as the board investigates the issue. The board said there was no mention of any travel time rate, which Grab has been collecting, when it released its order on the fare structure of TNCs on Dec. 27, 2016. What the December 2016 order stipulates is that TNCs, such as Grab, should impose a flagdown rate of PHP40, with an additional rate of PHP10 to PHP14 per km. In the meantime, the ride-hailing firm has complied with the LTFRB’s order and stopped implementing the per-minute charge.

The mobile app of Uber was deactivated Monday after it has earlier announced that it will operate in the Philippines until April 15.

Nograles, a principal author of the proposed Transport Network Services law, said providers of goods and services are required by law not just to issue official receipts but also a detailed breakdown of what were paid for. He said he would file a resolution calling for a congressional probe on the issue once sessions resume in May. Nograles recounted his commuting experience using Grab from his house in Makati to his office in Congress in Quezon City wherein the ride-hailing service failed to immediately provide him with a breakdown of his fare receipt.

Pimentel made the statement following news of the imminent exit of ride-hailing platform pioneer Uber from the country next week. On March 26, Singapore-based Grab acquired Uber's Southeast Asia operations, covering ride-sharing services in the Philippines, as well as Uber's operations in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Uber's last day of operations in the Philippines will be on April 8. Pimentel said that given these developments, it was incumbent upon the LTFRB to work overtime to process pending TNVS applications and to ensure that Grab would not take advantage of its monopoly of the TNVS industry. “Many regular TNVS users regularly compared the rates of Uber and Grab before booking a ride -- an option that will no longer be available to commuters when Grab becomes the sole TNVS provider come April 9,” he noted. \"There is a legitimate fear among regular TNVS users that Grab's acquisition of Uber's operations in the country will lead to higher fares, which is the natural consequence when a player monopolizes a particular industry,\" he said. He said that it would be beneficial if any one of them starts operation, referring to the reported application of other local ride-sharing companies for accreditation to operate in the country. Last week, the LTFRB said that Go Lag, Owto, and Hype were in the process of completing their TNVS accreditations before the agency. \"The LTFRB announcement that there are three new ride-sharing companies that want to enter the country can only be considered good news if any or all of these companies actually get to service our countrymen,\" Pimentel said. \"We need real competition, not potential competition. As long as riders have zero options, they will be vulnerable to overpricing and poor service -- and this is where the LTFRB must come in,\" he added. He also called on the LTFRB to \"strike a balance between encouraging the entry of new players and the need for these players to comply with the country's TNVS guidelines.\" He urged the LTFRB to pay close attention to feedback from TNVS users and put in place mechanisms to immediately act on rider complaints. \"Social media has provided the LTFRB with the tools to monitor the prices and the performance of Grab after Uber exits. But the real test will be how they respond to the feedback from commuters.

In a statement, the PCC has urged the parties to undergo a voluntary review of the deal, if the transaction does not meet the requirements for mandatory notification. Under the new mandatory threshold, entities involved in mergers and acquisitions shall notify the PCC if the size of transaction breaches PHP2 billion and PHP5 billion for size of the party. The PCC has reminded the parties that if the deal is notifiable, Grab’s acquisition of Uber should not yet push through until the Commission has reviewed and approved the transaction. “If the transaction does not meet the threshold and is not notifiable, the parties are not so precluded but Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anti-competition concerns,” the Commission said, on the other hand. “Should anti-competitive concerns arise out of the transaction review, the parties may propose commitments to remedy, mitigate, or present the negative effects to competition in the market after the acquisition,” the PCC added. But if the parties refuse to undergo a voluntary review, the Commission cautioned that it can launch a motu proprio investigation on its own initiative regarding the transaction. The Commission said the review aims to determine if the Grab and Uber merger will substantially lessen the competition in the ride-sharing market in the Philippines. The PCC will evaluate and analyze if the acquisition will result in a fare increase, deterioration of service, lesser competition, and how it will fairly compete once new transport network companies enter the market. “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-sharing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said. “The Grab-Uber acquisition is likely to have a far reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services. As such, the PCC is looking at the deal closely with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns, as a notified transaction, or by opening a motu proprio case,” the Commission said.

He said the LTFRB could issue a new policy through a board resolution encouraging more TNCs to be accredited. \"If, after some reasonable time, the LTFRB is unable or unwilling to protect the riding public with these measures, then it may very soon be necessary for Congress to divest the LTFRB of its power to regulate TNCs,\" he said. Calalang said Congress might opt to regulate the TNCs with its power to grant legislative franchises or transfer the regulatory authority of the LTFRB over TNCs to another government agency.

Grab Philippines spokesperson and public affairs chief Leo Gonzales turned over the reflectorized outfit to Cebu City administrator Nigel Paul Villarete, who said that some of the vests will also be provided to the traffic enforcers of the City Transportation Office. Gonzales said the donation is part of Grab Philippines’ corporate social responsibility, which includes helping local government units (LGU) in the country. He said the city government, which has been very supportive of the mobile ride-hailing app company, is the first LGU beneficiary in Cebu province. “Cebu City is very important to us, important market, important city,” Gonzales said. “And our partnership with Cebu City is very strong.” Gonzales said Grab Philippines decided to donate reflectorized vests as it is important for security personnel to be noticed. “It provides a level of security, a level of recognition, particularly for the security volunteers. It is important for them to be known and respected in their localities,” he said. Also present during the turnover, held at the Cebu City Hall, were Assistant City Administrator Annabeth Cuizon and Grab-Cebu Senior City Manager Raymond Dejan. Meanwhile, Gonzales announced that Grab Philippines will soon be operating in Tacloban City, where they will be initially tapping at least 100 private vehicles and 50 taxicabs to use their transport network system. Grab, a Singapore-based firm offering mobile ride-hailing and logistical services, is currently operating in Manila, Baguio, Pampanga, Cebu, Bacolod, Iloilo, Davao, and Cagayan de Oro.

Grab Philippines spokesperson Leo Gonzales said they are processing all requirements and negotiations with existing taxi operators and car owners for the entry of Grab in the regional capital of Eastern Visayas. “We know that Tacloban is a hub of the region with lots of opportunities here having a day-time population of close to one million. It’s important to bring technology here because if we bring technology, we bring innovation and we bring progress to this city,” Gonzales said in press briefing here Thursday.Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board Eastern Visayas regional office spokesperson Mel Llorono said Grab’s entry in the city would eliminate overcharging by rent-a-car operators in the region. “This is a solution to the operation of unregistered transport vehicles and professionalize transport service in our region,” Llorono said. Grab is eyeing to start its Tacloban operation within few months as part of its nationwide expansion. Currently, Grab is present in Manila, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Bacolod, Baguio, Cagayan de Oro, and Pampanga. In its initial operation, the company will tap about 100 private cars to use the system and will partner with 50 existing taxi units in the city. The mobile app allows people to virtually hail a cab with just a few taps on their smartphone. Available for free for Android, iOS and Windows phone users, Grab connects the passengers and the drivers to allow seamless commuting experience. The passengers just have to type in their place of origin and their destination, and wait for the app to assign a cab for them. When there is already an assigned cab, the passengers will know the location, plate number, estimated time of arrival of the cab, as well as the name and contact number of the driver. These features would allow the passengers to contact the driver for the specifics of the transaction. Grab is a Singapore-based technology company that offers ride-hailing and logistics services through its app in Singapore and neighbouring Southeast Asian nations such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, and Cambodia.

Hirna, a company that offers convenience to the taxi-riding public, said Cagayan de Oro will be the next city to establish its operation. Hirna, a play on the phrase “here na” or “here already”, said it will open business in this city following its launch in Davao City last month. Aminoden Guro, LTFRB-10 director, said Hirna’s entry will redound to the benefit of local passengers, noting that the popular ride-hailing companies Uber and Grab have not yet established a significant presence here. Francisco Mauricio, Hirna chief executive officer and president, said by choosing Davao and Cagayan de Oro, they aim to establish a foothold in Mindanao and work their way up to Visayas and Luzon once the business starts to pick up. Maurico said one of the key differentiating factors of Hirna is the “driver rating system” that keeps track of the drivers’ disposition on the road. Mauricio said Hirna has data analytics that look at the number of rejections made by drivers, citations, attitude problem, and other negative issues. “It [analytics] will collate to a driver rating system that would be shared between taxi operators and the LTFRB. The driver is then rated. We will know who the model drivers are and who are not,” he said. He also assured the drivers and operators that Hirna will have favorable effect on their income as the new player will not be imposing extra charges but only a minimal fee. Guro hopes the driver rating system will change the drivers’ outlook since their driving behavior and how they treat their passengers will be monitored. This will enable the agency to take appropriate action if the drivers violate existing transportation laws, he added. Among the complaints that LTFRB has been receiving from passengers included rejection, bad hygiene, and drivers wanting in good manners. At present, the city has 2,691 taxi units and close to a thousand operators, who were encouraged by the LTFRB-10 to consolidate their franchise by forming a cooperative or a corporation so they could be united, Guro said.

This after the LTFRB central office recently approved the petition of taxi operators nationwide to add several pesos to the prevailing fare. LTFRB-10 Director Aminoden Guro said taxi operators, who have not calibrated their taxi meters, cannot charge passengers with the new fare. He advised the riding public to check the meters of the taxi before paying the additional charge.In the new LTFRB order, the flag-down rate for taxicabs remains at P40, but passengers will now pay P13.50 for every kilometer, instead of P3.50 per 300 meters. Drivers can now also charge P2 per minute for the waiting time. To ensure that taxi drivers and operators comply with the order, Guro said taxi meters must be calibrated by private companies, and the units must be checked by LTFRB first before they are allowed to operate. The LTFRB has decided to implement the increase based on the petition of the drivers and operators who are complaining of higher fuel prices, the traffic congestion in Manila, and the revival of operation of the ride-hailing services, such as Grab and Uber, especially in the National Capital Region. According to the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, the fare hike for taxis is long overdue as the last increase was in 2010. The group said taxi operators are also suffering from financial hardship due to “record-low levels of dispatch and increases in spare parts prices and other expenses.” Ringo Lago, secretary-general of the transport group Solidarity of Transport in Region X-Pagkakaisa ng Samahan ng Tsuper at Operator Nationwide (Starex-Piston), described the fare hike as \"very laudable\". However, Lago also called on the administration to do something to solve the plight of the public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers. At the root of the transport workers' suffering, he said, is the scrapping of the oil deregulation law. The enactment of Republic Act 8479, or the Oil Deregulation Law, in 1998, led to the non-interference of the government with the pricing, export and importation of oil products, among other provisions.

Despite the fine, Uber still remains suspended but is a step closer from resuming regular operations. Poe said this move will soon allow the public to avail of more transport options. “I am happy that the riding public would somehow be able to regain its power in deciding what mode of public transportation to take after Uber paid the hefty and mind-boggling fine that the LTFRB imposed against the company,” Poe said in a press statement. Poe said she is close to completing the report on the transport network vehicle services (TNVS) bill that is currently undergoing technical working group (TWG) meetings. “The TWG meetings aim to thresh out and address all related issues concerning the operation of Uber, Grab and the like,” Poe said.

Ejercito made this statement on the sidelines of the closed-door meeting between representatives of the LTFRB and Uber in the Senate led by Senator Grace Poe, chair of the Senate Committee on Public Services. The senator pointed out that although Uber was “in-demand” by passengers, it is not an excuse to defy government regulations. He said that penalties will still have to be meted out. “I know that they’re popular, that’s why we want them to be back on the streets as soon as possible. We just made it clear that we want the interest of the riding public as a priority,” he added. Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV, in a statement, said that instead of a suspension, the LTFRB should only implement a fine as it would not affect daily operations. “Halting operations of Uber will only hurt the drivers and the riding public. A monetary penalty will give us the same result without having to hassle our commuters,” he said. Aquino also said that it was brought up in the meeting that Uber should compensate drivers for the days that they will not be able to use their vehicles. He said that it was also agreed that a new regulatory framework needs to be developed, not just for ridesharing services but also to improve our taxi fleets and their ability to serve the riding public and compensate drivers. The senator expressed hope that the LTFRB can propose a new framework to institutionalize changes to improve transportation in the country. In the same meeting, Uber Technologies Southeast Asia manager Michael Brown apologized to LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra for accepting applications for accreditations despite the board’s orders. On Monday (August 14), the LTFRB suspended Uber operations for repeatedly violating the board’s order to stop accepting driver applications. Uber filed a motion for reconsideration on Tuesday (August 15), however, the LTFRB rejected it.

Poe, in a statement, said that she was hopeful that the meeting with the LTFRB would help resolve the issue as public interest requires the Senate to exercise congressional oversight. She described the decision of LTFRB to suspend Uber services as “cruel and absurd.” “I am aghast that this agency that committed before the Senate to resolve the issues has just imposed a cure that will only make the disease much worse. It does not solve the problem, but further exacerbates the problem of having an utter lack of safe, reliable, and convenient transportation options for our people,” Poe said. Poe, chair of the Senate Committee on Public Services, described the LTFRB’s suspension order as a “defiance of the LTFRB officials’ commitment to provide a solution to the issues surrounding transport network vehicle services (TNVS) operations.” “When the Senate Committee on Public Services, during the last hearing, asked them to straighten out issues with the Transport Network Companies by October, the committee did not mean for them to suspend the operations of any TNC,” Poe said. “I was wrong to think that the LTFRB was on the same page with the Committee on how to come up with remedial rules pending the crafting of pertinent legislation,” she added. Poe said that the LTFRB suspended Uber’s services not because of lack of roadworthiness but because of “a mere administrative violation” which should have merited a corresponding administrative penalty. The senator pointed out that Uber’s penalty should not limit the public of their transport options. She further said that the public deserved to have options when it comes to choosing convenient, safe, and reliable transportation services to brave the daily punishing traffic jam. “Why can’t the LTFRB be innovative in coming up with an appropriate penalty that is fair and that will not prejudice the riding public? Is there no other less crippling penalty at our disposal? Thirty days is a long time,” Poe said. “Without reliable public transportation, those who depend on Uber for their daily commute will have to find an alternative or revert to their long and usual daily grind. Was the interest of the riding public, that is now compromised and jeopardized, ever factored in when the LTFRB came up with the suspension order?” she added. Automotive journalist James Deakin, in a statement, said that he supported the LTFRB’s decision to suspend Uber for a month but expressed hope that the board would be equally accountable for not doing their job in other areas. “As big a fan as I am of ride sharing, I support the LTFRB's decision to suspend Uber for a month. Harsh as it may be, rules are rules. And if Uber broke those rules by accrediting vehicles after the deadline, then so be it. The LTFRB are just doing their job. We have to respect that,” Deakin said. “I hope that in the spirit of fairness we can also hold the LTFRB equally accountable for not doing their job in other areas. After all, rules are rules,” he added. He, meanwhile, urged the LTFRB to also suspend operations of other public transport vehicles that transport passengers without permits.
