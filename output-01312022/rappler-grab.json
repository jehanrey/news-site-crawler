The Philippines, running second in Group B, hopes to secure a berth when it battles Indonesia at 10 pm on Thursday, January 27, at the Shri Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Pune, India.  The Filipinas snatched a late goal versus world No. 38 Thailand and held on for a 1-0 win in the curtain-raiser last January 21.  Still showing fine form, the Philippines next held world No. 11 Australia scoreless in the first half of their duel last January 24. But the national crew succumbed to a 4-0 defeat at full time as the Matildas finally found a crack in the Filipinas’ impressive defense.  After the match, Matildas head coach Tony Gustavsson said the Philippines is a team to “watch out” for in this year’s tournament as the Filipinas look to go deep in their campaign and also claim a FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 berth. Only the top two teams in the three groups alongside the two best third-placers will advance to the quarterfinals of the tournament, which also serves as a qualifier for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Australia is on top of Group B with 6 points and a +22 goal difference, followed by the Philippines with 3 points and -3 goal difference. Thailand sits at third with 3 points as well and a +3 goal difference, but loses the tiebreaker to the Philippines. World No. 94 Indonesia resides at the bottom of the group with 0 points and a -22 goal difference.A victory against Indonesia is the best case scenario for thePhilippines as it won’t have to worry about other results. But a draw coupled by two favorable scenarios from the Australia and Thailand match on Thursday will still see the world No. 64 Filipinas stay at second place and proceed to the quarterfinal stage. If the Filipinas draw versus the Indonesians, they will need the Australians to either win or draw against the Thais to secure a quarterfinal slot. The worst-case scenario for the Philippines is a loss against Indonesia coupled by either a Thailand win or draw as it will see the Filipinas fall to fourth in the group. Aside from Asian Cup glory, the Philippines can also earn a spot in next year’s World Cup as five automatic slots are up for grabs in the tournament.  If Australia, the World Cup 2023 co-host, winds up in the top five of the Asian Cup, the sixth-best team in the tournament will receive a spot in the most prestigious women’s football tournament. With the Filipinas a step closer in nailing a maiden World Cup berth, Philippine head coach Alen Stajcic said the players often talk about wanting to change the game and being a positive influence for the next generation. “There’s a lot of hard work to be done between now and qualifying, but you know hopefully we can give the Philippines and all the players back home – young boys and young girls – some inspiration and hope that they can play World Cups in the future,” said Stajcic. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/analysis-asia-good-news-to-bad-final-look-back-2021/","title":"[ANALYSIS] Asia’s good news to bad: A final look back at 2021","date":"Dec 28, 2021 3:21 PM PHT","snippet":"In our annual look back at Asia’s winners and losers, we find even the good news was bad in the year that was","body":"With the year-end devastation of Typhoon Odette and the COVID-19 pandemic still in our midst, there can be little surprise that like tens of millions of Filipinos, we are more than happy to bid a final farewell to 2021.  The year ahead promises no doubt more hope, challenge, and opportunity – if not necessarily more fun – in the Philippines, what with a presidential election approaching. Yet, whether the Philippines or the United States, it might well seem like it is always a matter of two steps forward and one step back as the coronavirus continues to evolve and so too the responses to it.  In our annual look back at Asia’s winners and losers, we find even the good news was bad in the year that was. The chaotic US withdrawal in August 2021 brought to an end an era of advancements in Afghanistan, and hunger and misery are on the rise again in one of Asia’s poorest nations. Still, even amid the “worse off” some are even more “worse off.” Sadly we give “worst year’ in Asia to Afghanistan’s beleaguered and increasingly-at-risk women and girls. The US presence in Afghanistan – the “graveyard of empires” – was doomed in part by hubris and denial. But a bright spot of the last 20 years was the dramatic improvement in the lives and opportunities for Afghanistan’s women and girls.  A record number of Afghan girls went to school. Women ascended in public life, taking on roles as ambassadors, parliamentarians and civil society leaders. The “Afghan Dreamers” – an all-female, high school robotics team – won acclaim in international competitions. Now, under a back-in-power Taliban, the worst may still be to come for Afghan’s women and girls as the world looks away. One-time de facto leader of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi found herself at year-end 2021 back where she has spent so many years – under detention by a military government – and takes the prize for “bad year” in Asia. After a military coup, the Nobel laureate was detained, tried, and found guilty on charges of incitement and breaking COVID-19 rules. Stalled democratic reforms and the persecution of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslim minority, which she did little to stop, had already dimmed the democracy icon’s prospects of instituting lasting change in her country. She is not alone though as the pandemic provided added cover for governments in Asia to restrict civil liberties and clamp down on protests. The awarding of a Nobel Peace Prize to Rappler’s own Maria Ressa and Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov underscored the challenges to free press and democracy worldwide. With her future now looking very much like her past, Suu Kyi offers up a case study of just how difficult it is for democracy to take root and thrive not only in Myanmar but in all of Southeast Asia. With the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics ultimately held in 2021 shining bright, and Beijing’s 2022 winter counterpart facing hurdles even before the games begin, the international Olympics sporting movement in Asia has had a decidedly mixed year. Despite concerns over budgets and COVID-19, the delayed Tokyo Olympics provided a much needed distraction from the pandemic. American gold medalist gymnast Sunisa Lee dazzled the world. And athletes from host nation Japan won the third most gold medals, after athletes from the US and China. Now in the countdown to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada have announced a diplomatic boycott of the games over China’s treatment of its Uyghur minority and other human rights concerns. A now vanished social media post by Chinese star tennis player Peng Shuai that was interpreted as alleging sexual misconduct by a former communist party leader had many posting #WhereIsPengShuai? – and raising prospects of more protests to come. These developments have many questioning whether the International Olympic Committee had put profits over principle, and whether the organization can live up to its charter of “promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity.” Amid the gloom and doom of 2021, Southeast Asia’s fintech firms benefited from changing consumer habits and growing investor interest. Lockdowns throughout Southeast Asia forced many indoors and increasingly online, accelerating a trend that was already gaining steam in Thailand and elsewhere before the pandemic hit.  In the first nine months of 2021, Southeast Asia saw a record 80 fintech deals worth US$3 billion, exceeding what was invested in 2019 and 2020 combined and making it a very good year for the sector. A one-time unicorn that has integrated itself into the lives of Southeast Asia’s citizens is Grab – the “Everyday Everything App” – which evolved from a ride hailing app to a digital platform and superapp that offers financial services, deliveries and much more throughout the region. In the largest SPAC merger and public listing deal of its kind, Grab went public at a nearly $40 billion valuation in December. Southeast Asia’s fintech players are also benefiting from venture capital shifting away from China as Beijing puts the brakes on the sector’s development and reins in one-time high-flying success stories, including Alibaba Group’s affiliate company Ant Group and founder Jack Ma. It now seems we will need to look also to Southeast Asia, rather than Northeast Asia, for digital trends that will shape our future. Hard-pressed to find anyone having had a great 2021, we give the dubious distinction of “best year” in Asia to the region’s new Cold War warriors. Year 2021 sadly proved to be a banner year for a return to Cold War rhetoric.  The election of US President Biden proved to be no panacea for troubled superpower relations as China’s President Xi Jinping stayed home, and Chinese nationalists and state-owned media including now “retired” Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin sought to push back against leaders from Australia, Canada and other nations whose views and values clashed with those of China. Social media in 2021 amplified the nationalistic rhetoric of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats, and bots and trolls made matters worse. The spread of COVID-19, China’s rapid military buildup and development of hypersonic missiles, militarization of the South China Sea and crackdowns in Hong Kong and China’s Xinjiang region as well as threats to Taiwan all heightened tensions. Is the United States in a Cold War with China? The answer could be “yes,” “no,” or “maybe” depending on the day of the week. The answer not only has deep implications for China and the United States, but for the Philippines, ASEAN and the world as nations navigate the US-China relationship and look to a better 2022. – Rappler.com Curtis S.

No member of the news and editorial team participated in the publishing of this piece. As it becomes the first-ever bell ringing ceremony in NASDAQ for Southeast Asia, Grab makes its debut after the company agreed to go public in a record-breaking SPAC merger with Altimeter Growth. With Grab known for providing the community with their everyday needs, its merchant-partners and driver- and delivery-partners reciprocate their support to the company during this huge milestone. Known for its best-selling Spinach Dip pizza, Angel’s Pizza owner Justin Liu is one of the thousands of Grab merchant-partners who are looking forward to Grab’s listing in the US. Understanding what this will mean for the entire community of MSMEs and driver- and delivery-partners on the Grab platform, he shares how this milestone will benefit more aspiring entrepreneurs out there. Through Grab, his business was able to achieve the highest standard of food safety through a partnership with FoodSHAP, as they are guided by key food safety and food handling standards, as well as overall hygiene protocols. Apart from this crucial recognition from the industry, he also highlighted how they are given learning opportunities to further succeed and grow their businesses.  “It’s going to have a rippling effect. [It makes me happy to think that businesses like ours can grow] through Grab, and because of that, we will also be able to serve more customers, given the additional perks and benefits that we will receive from them. I am very happy to see how all the support Grab has been giving us, is and will continue to reciprocate three-fold.” Liu shared. Meanwhile, the suspension of mass transport on the onset of the pandemic has thrown challenges for the ride hailing services industry but GrabCar driver-partner Carlo Mamaril did not think twice about looking for other sources of income as Grab continues to support his everyday needs and prepare him for long-term growth. More than just a platform that gets drivers- and delivery-partners onboard and provides livelihood opportunities, Grab always finds ways to support its partners in their everyday needs and allow them to succeed in their roles within and beyond the platform. These, along with livelihood support such as financial aid, training, and incentives, help all drivers- and delivery-partners cushion the challenges they are faced today and prepare for greater opportunities ahead. “Nakakatulong po ang Grab sa aming pamumuhay sapagkat bukod sa mga kinikita namin sa ibinabayad ng passengers na fare at incentives sa Grab, ay hawak pa namin ang aming oras at mas may oras kami sa pamilya at sa pag-abot ng aking mga pangarap balang araw. (Grab has helped us truly in our livelihood because apart from the income we get from passengers’ fares and the incentives we receive from the platform, we are also flexible with our time and gives us the time to be with our family and work towards achieving our dreams someday.)” he said. These testimonials from Liu and Mamaril are just two from the thousands of merchants and driver- and delivery partners who share the same sentiments. The whole Grab community is empowered with the news of Grab’s listing because they have witnessed how the company has already given them the support they need for their everyday needs and to thrive even beyond the platform.  With its goal of providing the everyday needs of the Filipino people through its services, Grab Philippines Country Head Grace Vera Cruz highlighted on LinkedIn the importance of this event, not just for the company, but how it will affect their stakeholders. “Grab’s debut at NASDAQ will enable the company to accelerate its efforts to help support more Filipinos. Through this, we are hopeful that we will be able to reach more small business owners and driver- and delivery- partners like Kim and Roberto in more parts of the country,” the country head said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/timeline-grab-holdings-history-launch-nasdaq-listing/","title":"TIMELINE: Southeast Asia’s Grab takes a ride to $40-billion SPAC listing","date":"Dec 3, 2021 1:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Here are some milestones for Grab, from the time it was conceptualized in a Harvard Business School venture competition plan in 2011 to its Nasdaq listing in 2021","body":"SINGAPORE – Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery platform Grab Holdings listed on the Nasdaq via the world’s largest special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal worth $40 billion.

It operates across 465 cities in eight countries in the region.","body":"Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-hailing and food delivery firm, listed on the Nasdaq on Thursday, December 2, following its $40-billion merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Altimeter Growth Corporation. The deal is the world’s biggest ever by a blank-check company and the biggest US listing by a Southeast Asian firm. Founded in 2012, Grab is Southeast Asia’s largest startup, valued at just over $16 billion last year. It launched as a Malaysian taxi-hailing service and now calls itself a “superapp” after expanding into food, grocery, and parcel delivery and to digital payments, lending, and other financial services. Singapore-headquartered Grab operates across 465 cities in eight countries in the region, counting Indonesia as its biggest. Its venture with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd was awarded a digital bank license in Singapore last year. Grab gained the global spotlight in 2018 when it bought the Southeast Asian business of Uber Technologies in return for the US ride-hailing company taking a stake in Grab. With some 8,000 employees, Grab has tech centers in Singapore, Beijing, Seattle, Bengaluru, and other places. Early investors include Japan’s SoftBank, China’s Didi Chuxing, and venture capital firms Vertex Ventures Holdings and GGV Capital. Grab raised about $12 billion ahead of the listing. Investors range from venture and hedge funds to automobile companies and other ride-hailing firms, and include Uber, Booking Holdings, China Investment Corporation, Coatue Management, Hillhouse Capital, Hyundai Motor Company, Invesco Ltd, Microsoft Corporation, Ping An Capital Company, Toyota Motor Corporation, and Yamaha Motor Company. In the SPAC deal, about three dozen investors came on board including Temasek Holdings, BlackRock, Fidelity International, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala, and Malaysia’s Permodalan Nasional Bhd and Altimeter Capital. GoTo Group, formed by the merger of Indonesian ride-hailing and deliveries firm Gojek and local e-commerce leader Tokopedia, is Grab’s biggest competitor. Singapore-based Sea Ltd, which has e-commerce, gaming, and a digital payments business, is also muscling into food delivery and financial services in Indonesia. Sea has also won a digital bank license in Singapore. Grab is likely to increasingly start competing with banks as it expands its financial services. It also competes with such delivery companies as Foodpanda and Deliveroo PLC. Grab’s third-quarter revenue fell 9% from a year earlier to $157 million. Its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) widened 66% to $212 million. Gross merchandise value hit a quarterly record of $4 billion. The delivery business has emerged as the biggest segment as more consumers shifted to online food delivery during the pandemic. Grab forecasts it will turn profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2023. Anthony Tan, 39, is the company’s chief executive officer and co-founder. Fellow co-founder Tan Hooi Ling, 38, runs Grab’s operations, including corporate strategy and technology. Both Tans, unrelated, met at Harvard Business School, where they conceived the idea of the ride-hailing company.

Its shares rise as much as 21% minutes after listing on the Nasdaq, before retreating to trade 23% lower.","body":"SINGAPORE – Shares in Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-hailing and delivery firm, slid more than 20% in their Nasdaq debut on Thursday, December 2, following the company’s record $40-billion merger with a blank-check company. Grab’s shares rose as much as 21% minutes after the listing before retreating to trade 23% lower at $8.51 by 1834 GMT. “The price makes no difference to me. I’m going to celebrate tonight and get back to work tomorrow,” chief executive officer Anthony Tan told Reuters just after the shares started trading. The backdoor listing on Nasdaq marks the high point for the nine-year-old Singapore company that began as a ride-hailing app and now operates across 465 cities in eight countries, offering food deliveries, payments, insurance, and investment products. Grab kicked off the biggest US listing by a Southeast Asian company with a bell-ringing event in Singapore, hosted by Nasdaq and Grab’s executives. The event was attended by about 250 people including its investors, drivers, merchants, and employees, with many dressed in the company’s signature green. Thunderous handclaps reverberated in the hotel ballroom as an emotional Tan thanked them for putting Grab and Southeast Asia’s tech economy on the global map. CEO Tan and Tan Hooi Ling developed the company from an idea for a Harvard Business School venture competition in 2011. The two Tans are not related. The listing comes after Grab’s April agreement to merge with US tech investor Altimeter Capital Management’s special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Altimeter Growth Corporation, and raise $4.5 billion, including $750 million from Altimeter. Grab’s flotation “will provide a bigger cash buffer” to its “cash burn,” S&P Global Ratings said in a note. But it said the company’s “credit quality continues to be constrained by its loss-making operations, and free operating cash flows could be negative over the next 12 months.” Southeast Asia’s internet economy is forecast to double to $360 billion in gross merchandise value by 2025, prompting Grab’s rivals, including regional internet firm Sea Ltd and Indonesia’s GoTo Group, to bulk up.  GoTo plans a local initial public offering in 2022 after completing an expected $2-billion private fundraising, sources have told Reuters. A US listing will follow the Jakarta offering. “Longer term, we’re really excited about Grab Financial Group,” said Chris Conforti, partner at Altimeter Capital, referring to Grab’s financial services unit. “I think the bell curve on that is much wider in terms of what the outcome could be, but it could be extremely large.” CEO Tan, 39, expanded Grab into a regional operation with a range of services, after launching it as a taxi app in Malaysia in 2012. It later moved its headquarters to Singapore. “What we have shown to the world is that homegrown tech companies can develop great technology that can compete globally, even when international players are in town,” Tan told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday, December 1. “We can compete and win.” He will control 60.4% of voting rights along with Grab’s co-founder, and president Ming Maa, but hold only a 3.3% stake with them. Grab’s listing brings a payday bonanza to early backers such as Japan’s SoftBank and Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing, which invested as early as 2014. They were later joined by the likes of Toyota Motor Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and Japanese megabank MUFG. Uber became a Grab shareholder in 2018 after selling its Southeast Asian business to Grab following a five-year battle.     In September, Grab cut its full-year adjusted net sales forecasts, citing renewed uncertainty over pandemic curbs on movement.  Third-quarter revenue fell 9% from a year earlier and its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) widened 66% to $212 million. GMV in the quarter rose to a record $4 billion. It aims to turn profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2023. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were the lead placement agents on the fundraising, while Evercore and UBS were the co-placement agents. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/china-rejects-allegations-grab-uganda-airport-possible-loan-default/","title":"China rejects allegations it may grab Ugandan airport if country defaults on loan","date":"Nov 29, 2021 8:15 PM PHT","snippet":"There has been public outrage in Uganda after a parliamentary probe concluded that China imposed onerous loan conditions","body":"China has rejected allegations that it may grab Uganda’s sole international airport if the East African country fails to service a $200-million loan for the expansion of the facility. A parliamentary probe last month concluded that China had imposed onerous conditions on the loan, including potential forfeiture of the airport in case of default, sparking public outrage. The Chinese embassy in Uganda, referring to a local headline, said late on Sunday, November 28: “The malicious allegation that ‘Uganda surrenders key assets for China cash’ has no factual basis and is ill-intended only to distort the good relations that China enjoys with developing countries including Uganda.” “Not a single project in Africa has ever been confiscated by China because of failing to pay Chinese loans.” China has been accused by Western countries of luring poor countries into “debt traps” which they are unable to repay. Cash-strapped borrowers have been pushed to stake sovereign assets such as airports and seaports to access credit. The Uganda loan was secured in 2015 from China’s Exim Bank, one of the many credit lines Uganda has acquired from China over the last 15 years to fund infrastructure projects including roads and power plants. The loan agreement has not been made public. Lawmaker Joel Ssenyonyi, who chairs the committee that conducted the parliamentary probe, said it gives Exim Bank approval powers over the airport’s annual budgets and that the loan terms allow China to “grab” the airport in case of default. Revenues from the airport’s operations are to be deposited in an escrow account where all withdrawals have to be sanctioned by Exim Bank, Ssenyonyi told Reuters on Monday, November 29, citing the agreement. The agreement also requires any dispute arbitration or court proceedings to take place in China under Chinese law, Ssenyonyi said. “So Uganda is locked out entirely, the contract is one-sided,” Ssenyonyi said. A Ugandan attempt this year to renegotiate the loan terms had been rebuffed by Exim Bank, Senyonyi said, citing disclosures to the committee by the finance minister, Matia Kasaija. Kasaija declined to comment. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/airbus-boeing-grab-deals-dubai-airshow-november-16-2021/","title":"Planemakers grab deals at Dubai Airshow","date":"Nov 17, 2021 8:55 AM PHT","snippet":"Most of the planes ordered are narrowbody models in highest demand from low-cost carriers like Europe's Wizz Air and Boeing's latest customer, Indian startup Akasa","body":"Global aerospace firms have secured tentative or firm orders for more than 400 airplanes at the Dubai Airshow, building on signs of a recovery from a global pandemic that has shattered the industry’s profits. After major orders for narrowbody jets and a new freighter earlier this week, Airbus secured a tentative deal for up to 30 A320neo narrowbody jets from Kuwait’s Jazeera Airways, while Boeing ended a recent dearth of orders in India. Most of the planes ordered were narrowbody models in highest demand from low-cost carriers like Europe’s Wizz Air and Boeing’s latest customer, Indian startup Akasa. “I believe this is a sign of recovery. The second half of the decade when most of these aircraft will be delivered is a long time from now, so it is reasonable to expect that at that point traffic will exceed pre-COVID levels,” said independent aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski. “It is also reasonable to expect that those who emerge from the crisis with lower costs and higher efficiency will win,” he added. A major question marks hangs over Asia, previously the engine of new jetliner demand, executives said, while some fretted over the concentration of orders among a few carriers. Airlines and suppliers nonetheless seized on signs of a fragile recovery, using the deadline of air show publicity to try to win last-minute concessions. The deal between Airbus and Kuwait’s Jazeera comes after the airline’s chairman, Marwan Boodai, told Reuters this month the budget carrier was aiming to buy up to $2 billion worth of jets. Akasa Air, backed by billionaire Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, finalized an order for 72 Boeing 737 MAX jets in a move that will help the US planemaker regain lost ground in one of the world’s fastest-growing markets. Boeing is also relying on the order to lend fresh support for the MAX, which remains grounded in China following an almost two-year safety ban that was lifted in the West late last year. The deal includes a high-density 200-seat version of the Boeing 737 MAX known as 8200, making Akasa the second major customer for that layout after Ireland’s Ryanair, which is locked in a dispute with Boeing over prices of new planes. The 8200’s configuration is suited to ultra-low-cost carriers focused on driving down costs per seat, though industry sources said Akasa would also have to fight for competitive airport costs to succeed in India’s choppy airline market. Nigerian carrier Ibom Air, owned by the Akwa Ibom state government, confirmed a deal for 10 Airbus A220s. Demand for wide-body jets underpinning big Gulf travel hubs like Dubai and Doha, whose carrier Qatar Airways is absent from this year’s show amid lingering diplomatic wounds in the region from a recent rift between Gulf states, remains thin as international travel recovers slowly from pandemic restrictions. “Once we see the relaxation of borders, entry requirements, and all the other paraphernalia with people traveling these days…then you will see the bounce-back in the countries that we are now flying to,” said Emirates president Tim Clark. The Emirates executive urged Boeing to provide firm dates for its delayed 777X, saying certification uncertainty had upended the carrier’s growth plans. Boeing had no immediate comment. Emirates is the largest customer for the previous version of the 777 as well as the Airbus A380 superjumbo, whose production is ending due to low sales. Clark, who has been among the biggest champions for the A380, predicted the double-decker would prove its mettle when travel recovers from the COVID-19 crisis. Some other industry leaders see a move toward smaller and more flexible jets. As supply chain problems hit manufacturing worldwide, Clark said Airbus had not been able to give a date for “even the last” A380 delivery that had been due mid-December. He also noted that labor shortages were hurting the industry. An Airbus spokesman said, “All deliveries are agreed with the customer and it is the customer’s privilege to announce them.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/results-collegiate-center-for-esports-mobile-legends-varsity-cup-november-12-2021/","title":"EAC, LPU grab share of lead in CCE Mobile Legends Varsity Cup","date":"Nov 13, 2021 4:13 PM PHT","snippet":"Lyceum and Emilio Aguinaldo College join Letran on top of the CCE Mobile Legends: Bang Bang 5-on-5 Varsity Cup","body":"Emilio Aguinaldo College and Lyceum of the Philippines University gained a piece of the lead with Letran after besting their counterparts in Day 3 of the Collegiate Center for Esports (CCE) Mobile Legends: Bang Bang 5-on-5 Varsity Cup (MVC) Friday, November 12.

Carlos, who finished in the Final Four of the CCE 1v1 Exhibitions last month, claimed the back-to-back MVP honors behind an impressive core display of Hayabusa and Lancelot as EAC trounced San Beda, 21-5, and 23-9. He was flawless in Game 1 that lasted only 13 minutes, flaunting Hayabusa with 8 kills, zero deaths, and 7 assists (KDA) before unleashing a lethal Lancelot with a 10/1/9 KDA in Game 2 that ended in just 14 minutes. Jomar Amador (Paquito and Esmeralda), Ralph Vincent Robin (Thamuz and X.Borg), Adrian De Guzman (Popol&Kupa and Chou), and Christian Angelo Cabuhat (Chang’e and Selena) provided support for Carlos in two easy wins. “Gusto lang naming manalo kahit 2-0 o 2-1 man yan. Masaya kami dahil panalo para mapunta kami sa upper bracket,” said Carlos. (We just wanted to win whether it’s 2-0 or 2-1. We’re happy with the win so we can reach the upper bracket.) Fresh off a one-day break after rolling past San Sebastian College-Recoletos, Lyceum shocked Perpetual led by 1v1 champion Jasper Cuevas with a close 2-0 win highlighted by a crucial lord steal in Game 2. The Pirates snatched Game 1 despite a 14-16 deficit in kills but they figured in a neck-and-neck second match before Yancy Remulla’s Ling saved the day with a timely retribution in the lord’s pit – paving the way for the finishing touches of Shawn Umali’s Chang’e riding the lord and minion wave. Lorenzo Navarro’s Harley (6/2/8 KDA) captured the MVP honor in Game 1 while Umali’s Chang’e (9/1/9 KDA) got it in Game 2 with Remulla, Alvin Baetiong and Carlo Abadeza throwing in help. Mapua University (Warren Bonifacio, Joaqui Garcia, Jasper Salenga, Adrian Nocum, Jomer Mercado, Angelo Parinas) then added to the piling woes of Perpetual following a 2-1 series win in the succeeding match of the CCE that streams on CALM Network with Alaxan FR, Bio-Agrownica, Rebel Sports Pilipinas, Efficascent Relaxscent Oil, Tagaytay Pura Vida Resort and Hotel, SMDC Malls, and Smart Communications, Inc. as sponsors. Garcia’s Alice registered the CCE MVC’s most kills thus far, finishing with an 18/3/7 KDA in the all-important Game 3 as the Cardinals improved to 2-1 to enter the top four marching into the last qualifying day. The Altas, for their part, suddenly slid to 1-2 as Cuevas along with Lean Martel, Shawn Orgo, Rey Joey Barcuma, and Kyle Cuevas failed to follow up their emphatic win over Jose Rizal University. Meanwhile, Arellano (Kai Oliva, Lars Sunga, Diego Ilao, Marlon Espiritu, Jifford Cahigas) finally barged into the win column after sweeping the squad of San Beda Damie Cuntapay, Yukien Andrada, Justine Sanchez, Tony Ynot, and Gabriel Cometa. The Chiefs, who bowed to College of St. Benilde (1-1) and San Sebastian (1-1), moved up to 1-2 to stay alive in playoff contention while the Red Lions remained winless in three matches after losses to Letran and EAC. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-holdings-earnings-report-q3-2021/","title":"Grab takes a hit from coronavirus curbs","date":"Nov 11, 2021 10:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Fresh COVID-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia hit Grab's mobility unit in the third quarter of 2021","body":"Southeast Asia‘s largest ride-hailing and food delivery firm Grab Holdings on Thursday, November 11, reported a 9% decline in third-quarter revenue, as its mobility business was hit by coronavirus curbs in some countries in the region. Fresh outbreaks in Southeast Asia hit Grab’s mobility unit that fell behind its deliveries business, its largest by billings. Its mobility business brought in $88 million in revenue, down 26% from a year earlier, while sales at its deliveries unit rose 58%. “Mobility and food delivery services were suspended in Vietnam for most of Q3, and six of our core countries in which we operate experienced tighter movement controls,” said chief financial officer Peter Oey. Grab is also seeing rising competition in the space from other “super apps” that provide a host of services under one app like Gojek in Indonesia. Singapore-based Grab, which clinched a $40-billion merger with blank check firm Altimeter Growth Corporation in April, the biggest of its kind, is nearing its US listing. Founded in 2012 as a regional taxi app in Malaysia, the SoftBank Group-backed company operates a “super app,” which provides ride-hailing, food, and grocery delivery, mobile banking, and payments in over 400 cities in eight countries in Southeast Asia. The company’s adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization widened 66% to $212 million. Total revenue fell to $157 million for the quarter ended September 30, from $172 million a year earlier. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/mine-steal-grab-very-quirky-online-ukay-ukays/","title":"Mine, steal, grab: 4 very quirky online ukay-ukays","date":"Oct 21, 2021 12:16 PM PHT","snippet":"Instead of having to weave your way through rows of hangers, these online ukays offer a more curated, fashion-forward experience!","body":"If you miss going to the ukay-ukays and in your area to find unique, cheap pieces for your wardrobe, you’d be glad to know that a growing thrifting community can be found on Instagram! And instead of having to weave your way through rows of hangers or dig through one giant cardboard box after another, these online ukays offer a more curated experience, featuring choice picks and even pre-styled top-and-bottom combos. The caveat: getting your item of choice is a speed game. Once these IG shops start uploading their drops for the week, pieces can be snapped up in literal seconds – so it’s key to tick the notification bells of your favorite shops so you can be first in line for their goodies.  Moreover, most shops operate on a “mine, steal, grab” system. Be the first to comment “mine” on the photo of an item, and you get first dibs. However, if someone decides to comment “steal,” then they overrule you and get dibs – but for a slightly higher price. Commenting “grab” overrules both “mine” and “steal” for the highest price – so if you see something you want really badly and don’t want competition for it, then “grabbing” may be the way to go.  Some items are also up for bidding. Even if someone has already “grabbed” something, shop owners could also open the item for bids higher than the “grab” price, in which case, it’s time to have an honest conversation with your bank account.  Given that shopping at online ukays can be quite the effort, it would be best to focus on a few key shops that offer truly extraordinary and quality pieces.  Here are four that we think are curated very well: With pieces costing P1,000 to P2,000, Sweet Repeatt is one of the pricier shops on IG – but for good reason. It offers voluminous, Japanese street style-type pieces that will make you look way cooler than everyone else.  As its name suggests, Irie Hippie is for every self-respecting boho babe. They’ve got tons of tribal prints and bold colors, ensuring that you have a summer beach trip wardrobe no matter the time of year.  If you’re a fashion exhibitionist, with a penchant for crazy, show-stopping outfits, then Gray of Thrifted by Gray is your fairy godmother. With her eye for items that are out of the ordinary, her picks are sure to make you stand out in a beautiful and bonkers way.  Finally, if you want something a little more classic – but with a twist – Second Impressionista is sure to have something for you. Here you can find more traditional feminine silhouettes, but in prints and colors that show you’ve still got funky taste.  Do any of these shops wet your sartorial appetite? Then get your measurements down pat and start mining, stealing, and grabbing, tout suite! – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/steven-muncy-rescue-southeast-asia-refugees-ramon-magsaysay-award-2021/","title":"Steven Muncy, Filipino at heart, comes to the rescue of Southeast Asia’s refugees","date":"Oct 17, 2021 4:00 PM PHT","snippet":"‘The biggest challenge is helping people understand why they should help,’ says the humanitarian, who receives the Ramon Magsaysay Award 2021 for his work helping refugees in the region through the Community and Family Services International","body":"It is uncommon for a non-Asian to win the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award, a prize that is usually given to Asian individuals and organizations who achieve excellence in their respective fields. But in 2021, the foundation awarded Steven Muncy, an American humanitarian. Muncy is no stranger to the Philippines and Southeast Asia. After all, he has worked in Southeast Asian countries since 1980 and has established a Philippine-based international nongovernmental organization called the Community and Family Services International (CFSI). CFSI is a humanitarian organization committed to “the lives, well-being, and dignity of people uprooted by persecution, armed conflict, disasters, and other exceptionally difficult circumstances.” Muncy is one of the five awardees of the Ramon Magsaysay Awards Foundation (RMAF) in 2021, alongside Filipino fisherman Roberto Ballon, Bangladeshi scientist Firdausi Qadri, Pakistani visionary Muhammad Amjad Saqib, and Indonesian production house WatchDoc. Muncy came to the Philippines as part of the Journeymen program in 1980, when he was just 23 years old. He was a working student when he saw reports of people fleeing Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The three countries were in the middle of the Indochina refugee crisis at the time. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said that over 3 million people were displaced and fled their homes due to the crisis. “I had never been outside the US. I didn’t know much about the world outside the US. But, for some reason, the plight of the Cambodian people, in particular, grabbed hold of me. I came in response to the refugee situation that was impacting the region in a very big way,” Muncy said during a virtual roundtable interview with reporters on September 10. Muncy described the Journeymen program as “somewhat like the Peace Corps,” where young individuals are given the chance to work abroad for two years in a variety of roles, including ministry-related work, social agriculture, and teaching. The program gives its delegates free accommodation, roundtrip airfare, and a “very, very small stipend,” said Muncy. When he was selected, he was given a choice whether to go to Thailand or the Philippines. “What attracted me to the Philippines was the fact that, at that point in time, the Philippines, which was offering refuge for refugees from countries like Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, was at the same time persecuting its own people. There was Martial Law. There were people who fled the Philippines because they felt like they could not stay safely in this country,” Muncy said. The young social work student found that dilemma so interesting that he decided to apply for an assignment to the Philippines. It was 1980. After a competitive selection process, Muncy was sent to the Philippine Refugee Processing Center in Morong, Bataan, where he was tasked to teach electricity to the refugees to help them with their livelihood. Although the young social worker knew nothing about the task given to him, he stayed and eventually learned more about the other needs of the refugees. “Very shortly, it became clear to me that there were many refugees in that camp who needed the kind of services for which I was trained: counseling, social work, problem-solving, supporting families in difficult times,” Muncy said. About a year later, he decided to leave the Journeymen program to start CFSI to address the growing psychosocial needs of the refugees in the camp. Leaving the Journeymen program meant Muncy had to forgo his benefits, including the stipend and the free airfare back to his home country. “I’ll tell you very frankly, I had no money. Food became an issue very quickly,” Muncy admitted. He said CFSI would not be the way it is today if not for retired general Gaudencio Tobias, who supported his needs as he was starting CFSI. Tobias took care of Muncy’s meals. But because Muncy did not want to burden the general, he usually opted to eat packs of Chippy, a Filipino brand of corn chips, and bottles of Coke. Other volunteers helped Muncy establish CFSI. Some of them were spouses of full-time employees in the camp who were willing to give their time to the organization, while others were social workers. Muncy said most of them worked for free. However, Muncy soon realized that in order to really do something, the organization had to have some cash. The first donation came in 1981 from a group of expatriate workers whom Muncy did not even know at the time. The group gave CFSI $600. “The first year, for myself, I had no income. We really had no money. So we had that small donation, and we wrote proposals at night,” Muncy said during a one-on-one interview with Rappler on September 23. Money started coming into the foundation in April 1982, which allowing them to expand their services and staff. The organization owes it to the Norwegian government, through a Norwegian humanitarian coordinator, who asked to receive a proposal from CFSI in 1981. The proposal was approved and the funding was coursed through the UNHCR. CFSI and the UNHCR have been partners ever since. Today, CFSI is composed of about 400 people and works in three countries: the Philippines, Myanmar, and Vietnam. It has also assisted refugees in 48 countries and territories over the years. “It’s done more than we ever expected. Most of us thought that the refugees coming into the Philippines…would only do so for five, six, seven, eight years. So when we established the organization, believe it or not, we said in the incorporation papers that it would have a life span of 10 years. But the refugees continued to come…. I think, maybe nine years into our work, we were then asked to expand to the other countries in the region,” Muncy told Rappler. When CFSI started, it focused on psychosocial services, such as counseling and mental health support. Muncy decided to address this need after he encountered many women refugees in the camp in Bataan who were attacked and raped by sea pirates. “Doing this day in and day out, it became clear to me that we needed psychosocial and mental health services. Back then, that was rather unusual and not worthy of donor support,” Muncy said. The organization provided basic counseling, needs assessment, all the way up to psychiatric care. As they were able to develop the program, they were able to bring in psychiatrists from Manila. They also got support from the Norwegian Psychiatric Association. As the organization grew, it started expanding its services to livelihood and water sanitation. But perhaps a distinctive work that CFSI is doing now is providing education not only to refugees but also to social workers in conflict-affected areas. CFSI developed the Social Work Education Project, wherein they bring the master’s program to social workers who can’t afford to leave the conflict-affected areas they’re in. CFSI has partnered with different institutions to make this happen. The program has helped more than 300 individuals across the region to get advanced university degrees in social work. In Cotabato City alone, Muncy said, they were able to graduate 100 people at the master’s degree level. In addition, CFSI invests its time and energy in providing education to children, out-of-school youth, and illiterate refugees. Muncy, now 64 years old, has been in the Philippines for more than half his life. Much of his life has been devoted to humanitarian work in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, but all of this would not have been possible had it not been for his early life in the US. “I really don’t know when I first encountered a social worker. I come from a very humble family and I had not planned to go to university. It was something beyond us,” Muncy told Rappler. He was able to go to college through a scholarship, and applied for an accountancy degree. In his first year, however, he took a class on social problems, and everything has changed since then. “I knew right then and there that that’s what I wanted to do. Why, I don’t know. But something just resonated with me and I’ve never looked back since then,” Muncy said. Muncy and CFSI have come a long way. The American humanitarian has been in the Philippines for over 40 years now, but he has no plans of slowing down. “This is a good place for me. I would hope, if the powers would allow me to remain in the country, I’d be happy to do that,” Muncy said. Muncy also shared that he plans to use his Ramon Magsaysay Award to raise more funds for CFSI. “I’m going to be very candid with all of you. I hope to use the Ramon Magsaysay award as a platform to raise $10 million by the end of the 40th anniversary year of CFSI. I’d like to see $10 million or P500 million coming into CFSI that would allow us to do things,” Muncy said. CFSI has been commemorating its 40th year since June 1, and its celebration will end on May 31, 2022. The money that Muncy hopes to raise for CFSI will be used primarily for two things. One is to expand CFSI’s response to humanitarian situations in the Philippines and Myanmar. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military seized power on February 1. The other is to train more people at the master’s degree level in social work, which would entail working with schools of social work in the region, to help them develop a curriculum that is focused on displacement, humanitarian action, and peace-building. Muncy also hopes it could help them provide scholarships so that people can finish degrees in social work. “It’s very easy to think of the ‘other’ as out there and not my responsibility. My point of view is we all belong to the human family, so if one is suffering, we have a responsibility to extend help,” Muncy said. For this thankless job, the RMAF said it recognizes Muncy’s work in helping displaced refugees of Southeast Asia rebuild their lives.  “The RMAF board of trustees recognizes his unshakable belief in the goodness of man that inspires in others the desire to serve; his life-long dedication to humanitarian work, refugee assistance, and peacebuilding; and his unstinting pursuit of dignity, peace, and harmony for people in exceptionally difficult circumstances in Asia,” the RMAF said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-philippines-years-apart-conversations-maria-ressa/","title":"[OPINION] The Philippines 4 years apart: 2 conversations with Maria Ressa","date":"Oct 13, 2021 5:28 PM PHT","snippet":"'To the world, the hero that is Maria Ressa is brilliant, fearless, and relentless. To me as a friend,  she has always been always warm, cheerful even during crises, and incredibly stubborn when told to take care of herself.'","body":"When I first got wind of my friend Maria Ressa’s Nobel Peace Prize, I was filled not only with pride, but especially with longing. My first instinct was to give her a long hug, something which has not been possible since our last meeting on February 27, 2020. That evening, worried about some mysterious virus in the news, my wife and I gave her a bottle of Purell for her flight the next day as we shared a dessert of mochi in black sesame sauce in a crowded cafe in New York’s Chinatown. You know what happened after that. Maria and I first met in 1999 when she was covering LGBTQ+ life in Asia for CNN and I was a student in the University of the Philippines and a co-founder of the lesbian organization UP Sappho Society. Three years later in 2002, I met her again as the friend of Roz Espinosa, a visiting New Yorker I had just started seeing romantically. Maria looked at us with her inquisitive journalist glare and with her squeaky voice asked, “So, are the two of you together?” I moved to New York within weeks of that meeting, eventually marrying the New Yorker. Maria has since been a constant presence in our lives, with Roz and I witnessing her personal and professional journey through the years. In 19 years of friendship, Maria and I have had countless conversations about the Philippines, the US, the world, love, relationships, family, and the future. Since New York is a frequent stop on her trips and we usually stay with her when we’re in Manila, Maria is the friend we see the most. However brief these meetings are in between Maria’s ever-hectic life, there is at least an hour of great conversation between us. Sometimes, when the topic excites her, she even records them. I found two of these videos today, hoping to catch a moving and audible presence of the friend I missed and wanted so much to congratulate this week. But instead of Maria’s presence, what I found was the difference in how we both spoke about the Philippines between 2013 and 2017, captured in 30-minute conversations from each of those years. In 2013, I visited Manila to receive my Palanca Award. After joining us for the ceremony, Maria interviewed me about being an out lesbian in the Philippines, the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York and in the United States, the courage to write about queerness, the Filipino diaspora, and life as a Pinay in New York. Maria actually had the time and emotional bandwidth to discuss these topics. They seemed quite relevant at that time. That conversation feels like a whole lifetime away. Three years later in 2016, President Duterte was elected in the Philippines, and President Trump in the United States. When Maria visited New York in 2017, the horror of institutionalized extrajudicial killings in the Philippines was well underway, and Rappler’s coverage of the carnage was beginning to get scrutinized. Over banana split in a Brooklyn restaurant, I started talking to Maria about my heartache watching the mass murder in our homeland as well as Trump’s Muslim ban and hateful language, when she grabbed her gimbal and said, “Hold on, let’s put this on Facebook Live!” On video in our living room, we discussed my reluctance to write about the current situation, the troll armies employed by the administration, and how social media was being weaponized. I answered live questions from the audience. I received angry comments. I hyperventilated. I smirked nervously when I said the words “mass murder.” I made a reference to the Holocaust. I whined about my twice broken heart about two countries I loved. Little did we know that the terror of President Duterte’s term was only just beginning, and that it was only a matter of time for his administration to turn his attention to Maria and her Rappler crew’s determination to hold the line. In 2018, the first cases were filed against Maria and Rappler. Their palace correspondent Pia Rañada was banned from covering the President in Malacañang. Numerous arrest warrants were issued and more bogus charges were filed. Maria’s family, friends, and colleagues around the world began worrying for her life.  When press freedom is threatened and media is suppressed by a country’s government, it’s not just its current atrocities and abuses that are misreported and covered up. When thousands of Filipinos have been killed and continue to be killed by state-sanctioned murder, all the other topics and subjects for discussion and reporting become secondary at best, and at worst, forgotten. I felt this immediately when I could not write about anything without tackling the enormity of the administration’s summary execution program. How dare I go back to my usual topics of LGBTQ+ discrimation, women’s rights and reproductive health, overbearing family members, and toxic Filipino culture? How petty it felt to write fiction, to feature music and art, or to talk about anything other than the bodies being found in city streets every night? There was no accessible solution for it, and yet any vocal opinion or criticism was met with violent threats on good days, and a bullet in the head on bad. To me it felt like only the elephant in the room deserved to be discussed, but that elephant could never be touched. Suddenly my 2013 interview with Maria felt shallow and irrelevant. Even our concerns in our 2017 conversation felt laughable. I can only describe those two recorded moments with Maria, but for her it was only the beginning of a very long ride.  Since that last recorded conversation, there was no longer time during visits to grab the gimbal and do a fun interview. In our meetings squeezed between her hundred commitments, we only had a few moments to talk about what she was facing and our concern for her welfare. It became real for us in 2018 when we stayed with her in Manila and were given instructions on what to do if the authorities came knocking. “Tell them you’re American citizens,” we were told, as if that would protect us from the lawlessness of whoever might come. “Get it on Facebook Live.”  Roz and I laughed at the precariousness of our situation before realizing that for our dear friend this terror was 24/7, where things can and do change in a second, where one’s affairs must always be in order, and where each meeting with friends and family has to be treated like it’s the last. It was not a life for us, but it is a life that is a given when one chooses to hold the line. To the world, the hero that is Maria Ressa is brilliant, fearless, and relentless. To me as a friend,  she has always been always warm, cheerful even during crises, and incredibly stubborn when told to take care of herself. Whatever meal it was that we shared several times a year in New York, whether it be Korean BBQ or our favorite Szechuan on Mott Street, we always parted ways by yelling out, “Go on and save the world, or something!” because even if we spent the last hour or two laughing and talking about our personal details, that was what she was doing every second of her life. The Nobel Peace Prize is an incredible honor, of course, and puts the Philippines and its hellish landscape for the past five years on the global radar. Maria’s lifelong commitment to truth and integrity definitely deserves all the recognition. But when I think about the circumstances that brought us to this point: the unnamed journalists and activists who actually paid for their integrity with their lives, the tens of thousands killed by a fictional drug war since 2016, the corruption not only of the nation’s coffers but especially of its morals and psyche, I cannot help but mourn the country that was lost in this short span of time. It brings me back to the innocence of my 2013 video with Maria, both of us happy (even baby-faced), likely on our way to dinner after that shoot. She asked me questions that were important then but now all feel silly in face of death and daily terror. I cringe when I watch that video because I feel foolish to be discussing what now feels like fluff. It makes me think about all the things that were important then — topics, convictions, rights, lives, and dreams — all so distant and irrelevant now, crushed like all the hopes of everyone else who never get a chance to be asked how they feel.  All that is left is what was lost, the Nobel being the worldwide symbol of that, and Maria Ressa, Rappler’s founders and crew, weary but still standing up, now especially strong and proud, for what has always been and will always be right. – Rappler.com Shakira Sison is a Filipino American writer living in New York City."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/interview-lenovo-asia-pacific-president-amar-babu-october-2021/","title":"Q&A: Lenovo Asia Pacific president on consumer electronic trends","date":"Oct 11, 2021 4:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Lenovo's Amar Babu tells us how consumer trends shifted during the pandemic, and how he sees them evolving as more people get vaccinated","body":"Disclosure: This article contains affiliate links from our partners. We earn a small commission when you shop using these links. Electronics and computer maker Lenovo recently offered an interview with the brand’s Asia Pacific president, Amar Babu.  We took the chance to ask him about trends in the PC and consumer electronics business, as well as the chip shortage that has affected not just PC users but also the automotive industry.  Read our full email Q&A below.  Lenovo had a very good 2020. What were the kinds of products and services that consumers in the region demanded the most during that year? How different is the product demand landscape in 2021? The pandemic has led to a massive shift in working and learning habits and impacted the way people interact with technology. Beyond products, our customers’ demand for integrated technology solutions has also increased dramatically, and we expect this trend to continue. Lenovo is on a journey to transform from a devices company to a comprehensive services and solutions provider to meet this demand, which we believe will drive long-term growth for the company.    In the past, accessories such as a good headset, microphone and laptop stands were seen as luxuries. Today, they are considered necessities in the online office and classroom. Midstream to higher end processors have also seen an increased demand as users leaned on devices to navigate these new online environments, often requiring robust hardware, software, and stable connectivity to work and learn effectively. Furthermore, services have taken center stage as more people look to collaboration and productivity tools in addition to the gadgets they already have – or plan to have. Customers have also come to recognize the value of responsive after-sales services and pre-packaged solutions in line with their new hybrid lifestyles.   As cities went into lockdown, consumers spent more online and retail businesses had to rapidly adopt new payment systems, delivery methods and business models. Shoppers are looking for smarter, more convenient and safer experiences, and Lenovo is well-positioned to meet these demands with our Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions for retail. Lenovo is already providing technology solutions to major retailers around the world and in the Philippines, such as global F&B leader Jollibee Group. As more people get vaccinated, it’s going to change computing habits again. And in turn, it changes buying patterns too. Do you think desktop and laptop computers will continue to sell well, or will there be a dip as people become more mobile again? What are Lenovo’s consumer predictions in the region as it pertains to the changing COVID situation?  Laptops and desktops will continue to be in demand, especially among small and medium businesses (SMBs) and enterprise segments. Notebooks are expected to become more popular as companies continue their remote work setup, with some even adapting it for the long term. A significant growth contributor for PC shipments in Asia Pacific over the past year has been the education segment, as PCs are distributed to support students’ transition to distance learning. With classrooms expected to have a hybrid nature in the future, educators and parents will be exploring ways to ensure learning remains engaging, especially in a remote online setting.  Our recent Lenovo-Microsoft Education Technology showed opportunities for distance learning to be more effective and beneficial for students and educators across Asia Pacific. Collaborative technologies and Artificial Intelligence will be crucial in driving this, such as Lenovo’s Device-as-a-Service (DaaS) offerings and cloud-based software. In 2022, what will the tech consumer look like, and what are Lenovo’s plans to cater to that or adjust to that? At Lenovo, our vision is to drive smarter technology for all. We are committed to making technology accessible for everyone, everywhere. As the world becomes increasingly technology dependent and people continue to adopt hybrid models and flexible arrangements for work and school, the technology consumer will be anyone who is looking to make their everyday run more smoothly. To cater to that need, we are committed to challenging convention in our products and services. We recently unveiled new innovative products such as the Lenovo Yoga Tab 13 which won a Red Dot Award for its design, and the expanded range of Lenovo Go purpose-built PC accessories to improve the overall workspace experience.  The importance of diversity and inclusion has also becoming increasingly clear as the pandemic revealed the vast digital divide across society. At Lenovo, we are committed to incorporating diversity and accessibility into our products, ensuring that they work for everyone – regardless of background or ability. In our latest Environmental, Social and Governance report, we announced that 75% of our products will be vetted by inclusive design experts from our Product Diversity Office by 2025.  We are also focused on helping organisations and businesses drive intelligent transformation. Our range of services and solutions such as the TruScale Infrastructure Services benefit businesses looking to scale their IT hardware and software framework for a rapidly digitalizing world.  Additionally, education remains a key industry for us, and we are constantly pushing the boundaries to bolster our vertical solutions offerings through smarter tools and collaborative software to enhance learning.  What can consumers in the Philippines expect from Lenovo in the latter half of the year and 2022? What product categories will remain strong in the time period, and are there other product categories you’re planning to strengthen? The hybrid lifestyle is a key emerging trend that we are tapping on, and we are working to help our customers embrace this with products and services that address their needs both at home and at work. We have introduced a strong line-up of new products at the recent Mobile World Congress (MWC), specially designed to adapt to the current realities of work, learn, and play, and integrated with more ergonomic technology suited for all-rounded use.  Consumers in the Philippines can look forward to the new IdeaPad 5i Chromebook and IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook 2-in-1, as well as the grab-and-go Lenovo L15 Mobile Monitor.  We have also huge ambition in the gaming sphere. There are over 43 million gamers in the Philippines, and there is already a lot of excitement around Lenovo Legion products. We’re excited to share what we have in store with Filipino gamers soon.  How has the gaming category for Lenovo been in recent years? It’s a very competitive space, gaming, so what strategies are Lenovo doing to stand out from the competitors? Lenovo Legion is the fastest-growing gaming PC brand in Asia Pacific and is one of the most recognizable names in gaming today. Our aim is to become synonymous with gaming in Asia Pacific. We are doing this by focusing on delivering the most powerful and innovative hardware, while offering services that cater to the specific needs of gamers.    For the Lenovo Legion range, we have seen high demand for powerful PCs like our Legion gaming notebooks that can support multitasking and provide the horsepower needed for both work and play. For example, our Legion 5 Pro laptop has shown performance results of 12 hours at maximum clock speeds with zero throttling in external lab testing scenarios. Aside from laptops, we also have the Legion Phone Duel 2, now in its second iteration which provides a mobile, immersive gaming experience at an attainable price. Our service-led approach also applies to gaming, with services like Legion Ultimate Support which launched in Philippines in May 2021. It is the only gamer-centric support service among competitors, providing customer support for gaming-related software and hardware issues.  How has the global chip shortage affected Lenovo’s ability to deliver products here in the Philippines, and how has the company been addressing this? The shortage of semi-conductors remains a global challenge that impacts the technology industry alongside many others. Despite this hurdle, Lenovo is still able to deliver consistent quarterly and annual results, with its recent record first quarter results reaching a net income margin of 2.8%, the highest in many years. This was made possible with our operational scale, with strong supplier and partner relationships. These have allowed us to maximize available supply and continue delivering products and alongside our services in solutions in the Philippines and across Asia Pacific. – Rappler.com  Buy the latest Lenovo gadgets at discounted prices using these Shopee promo codes."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/volleyball/asian-club-championship-women-classification-round-choco-mucho-rebisco-october-6-2021/","title":"Choco Mucho earns shot at 5th, Rebisco bows out of Asian Club Volleyball","date":"Oct 6, 2021 4:27 PM PHT","snippet":"Choco Mucho wins the all-Filipino bout against Rebisco to set up a battle for fifth place with Kazakhstan's Zhetysu squad","body":"Choco Mucho grabbed its first win in the 2021 Asian Club Volleyball Championships over fellow Philippine squad Rebisco on Wednesday, October 6 at Terminal 21 in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.  Choco Mucho rallied from a set down to boot out Rebisco out of the tournament in four sets, 22-25, 25-17, 25-19, 25-17, in the classification round.  This sets up a rematch between Choco Mucho and Kazakh team Zhetysu in the battle for fifth place on Thursday, October 7, 1:30 pm.  Kalei Mau led Choco Mucho with 20 points while MJ Phillips played her best game yet in the tournament with 13 points, including 7 in the fourth set. Mylene Paat and Dell Palomata added 11 and 10 points, respectively, to backstop Choco Mucho’s offense. Choco Mucho was fired up early, nabbing the lead in the first and second technical timeouts, but the young Rebisco squad overturned its deficit with a crucial 5-0 run to cruise to set point, 24-20.  Though Choco Mucho managed to save two set points, Rebisco’s Ivy Lacsina went for the kill to give the younger squad the lead in the match.  “It was challenging playing against a younger team,” Mau said. “It was really great to be able to just find their tendencies and also work on ours and just work our creativity as a team.” Phillips provided a spark for Choco Mucho in the second set, fueling a run that gave them a nine-point lead, 20-11, that propelled the squad to clinch its first set win in the tournament.  Riding on its winning momentum, Choco Mucho tested Rebisco’s defense and stretched the lead to six in the third frame, 20-14.  Rebisco struggled to stage a comeback even with the entry of Eya Laure as Choco Mucho relied on its blocking to cruise to a 2-1 set lead.  In the fourth set, Choco Mucho rallied from an early deficit, 4-7, to arrest a momentum shift to the Rebisco side, and later escaped a stalemate for an 11-10 edge.  Phillips and Mau combined to lead the Choco Mucho offense as the squad wrapped up the first win for the Philippines.  “We got to play with our veteran ates (big sisters). It was really a very good experience for us younger girls and we have learned a lot,” said Faith Nisperos, who led Rebisco with 12 kills. “This experience has been a very good step for us, especially us college students.”     Dindin Santiago-Manabat added 11 points for Rebisco, while Mhicaela Belen, who at 19 is the youngest in the national squad, had 10 points. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/volleyball/updates-games-philippine-teams-asian-club-championship-2021/","title":"LIVE UPDATES: Philippine teams at Asian Club Volleyball Championships 2021","date":"Oct 1, 2021 11:20 AM PHT","snippet":"Bookmark this page for live updates of the Philippines' campaign in the  2021 Asian Club Volleyball Championships","body":"Philippine teams Rebisco and Choco Mucho stage a comeback to international play with their participation in the 2021 Asian Club Volleyball Championships in Nakhon Ratchasima in Thailand.

But Move It denounces other companies for allegedly orchestrating the suspension.","body":"The Department of Transportation’s motorcycle taxi technical working group (TWG) ordered Grab and Move It to suspend their partnership starting Thursday, September 30, just a week after operations began. The partnership is premised on users being able to book Move It drivers through the Grab app. In a statement on Thursday, the TWG said the parties “were not operating in accordance [with] agreed parameters and guidelines.” “Grab’s application instead of Move It’s application was used to avail, book, and pay for the ride service; and that the entire process of training, driver onboarding, marketing, issuance of official receipts, and the use of the Grab Driver app was all undertaken by Grab,” the TWG said. It added that the partnership makes it appear as if Grab is a “de facto member” of the pilot study on motorcycle ride-hailing services. “Grab’s entry is a circumvention of the processes and guidelines that had been laid down at the start of the study,” the TWG said. The TWG claimed that Move It and Grab “were not prepared to engage” in the collaboration. But Move It maintained that it has been transparent with the TWG and other stakeholders. “Our partnership has gone through several rounds of discussions with the TWG where all of their concerns were addressed. So bakit ngayong naka-launch na kami, tsaka kami ipapa-suspend (So why are they suspending us after we’ve already launched)?” asked Move It. Move It also said the “maneuvering,” which it blamed on “complaints” by other members of the pilot study, was tantamount to bullying. “This suspension was orchestrated by a number of stakeholders in the motorcycle taxi pilot against Move It – the smaller player in the pilot,” it said. “We strongly condemn this maneuvering by other stakeholders resulting [in] this suspension as it is anti-consumer, anti-Filipino, and is tantamount to bullying.” While Move It did not name the companies, the other two members of the pilot study are Angkas and JoyRide. Move It disclosed that the partnership it sealed with Grab was offered to Angkas and JoyRide as well, but the two declined. “Mahirap na po ang buhay kaya dapat tayong magtulungan – at hindi naman po masama ang humingi ng tulong,” Move It said. (Life is very difficult right now that’s why we have to work together – and it isn’t bad to ask for help.) Grab, meanwhile, said discussions with the regulators are still ongoing.  “Grab is committed to empowering local businesses, and our partnership with Move It is consistent with our ongoing efforts to help everyday entrepreneurs thrive and succeed,” it said. Grab said it hopes that the partnership will be given the green light again soon. “The pandemic has brought upon many challenges to the transport industry, and these challenges would require a whole-of-industry solution,” it said. “As a community partner, Grab Philippines will continue to do right by our consumers and partners, encourage constructive dialogue using facts and objective information, and help contribute to the recovery of our transportation industry.” Aside from studying the legalization of motorcycle taxis, the government allowed their operations to augment transportation in Metro Manila starting October 2020, amid the limited options due to coronavirus restrictions. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/africa/tunisians-protest-against-president-power-grab/","title":"Tunisians protest against president’s power grab as opposition deepens","date":"Sep 26, 2021 6:58 PM PHT","snippet":"Tunisian President Kais Saied has given himself power to rule by decree two months after he sacked the prime minister, suspended parliament and assumed executive authority","body":"Several hundred demonstrators gathered in Tunis on Sunday, September 26, under a heavy police presence to protest against Tunisian President Kais Saied’s seizure of governing powers in July and called on him to step down. Saied this week brushed aside much of the 2014 constitution, giving himself power to rule by decree two months after he sacked the prime minister, suspended parliament and assumed executive authority. “The people want the fall of the coup,” they chanted in the center of Tunis along Habib Bourguiba Avenue, a focal point of the demonstrations that ended the rule of former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on January 14, 2011. “Step down.” The crisis has endangered the democratic gains that Tunisians won in a 2011 revolution that triggered the “Arab spring” protests and has also slowed efforts to tackle an urgent threat to public finances, worrying investors. “He (Saied) is a dictator who betrayed the revolution and betrayed democracy…he gathered all the powers…it is a coup and we will bring down the coup in the streets.” Saied has said his actions are needed to address a crisis of political paralysis, economic stagnation and a poor response to the coronavirus pandemic. He has promised to uphold rights and not become a dictator.  Tunisia’s influential labor union on Friday rejected key elements of President Kais Saied’s seizure of near total power and warned of a threat to democracy as opposition widened against a move his foes call a coup. A first protest against Saied since his intervention on July 25 took place last week. Tunisia’s largest political party, the moderate Islamist Ennahda, has called Saied’s moves “a flagrant coup against democratic legitimacy” and called for people to unite and defend democracy in “a tireless peaceful struggle”. Four other political parties issued a joint statement condemning Saied on Wednesday and another large party, Heart of Tunisia, has also done so. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/motorcycle-taxis-available-grab-philippines-starting-september-23-2021/","title":"Motorcycle taxis available on Grab starting September 23","date":"Sep 22, 2021 4:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines partners with Move It for its motorcycle taxi services","body":"Commuters will be able to book a motorcycle taxi on the Grab app starting Thursday, September 23. In a statement on Wednesday, September 22, Grab Philippines said it partnered with Move It for its motorcycle ride-hailing service. Move It will still offer motorcycle rides through its app, but the partnership will allow its riders to have a wider market given Grab’s large user base. Similar to Grab’s transport bookings, cashless payments will be implemented. Commuters can pay through credit or debit card, GrabPay credits, or by cashing in with the driver. “Through this landmark partnership, we are confident that many Filipinos will experience and enjoy its many benefits, and we are hopeful that the bike-hailing industry will continue to recover from the impacts of the pandemic,” said Move It president and chief executive officer Francis Juan. Since the service is being offered during the coronavirus pandemic, commuters will have to bring their own helmets. Commuters can book Mondays to Sundays, from 5 am to 10 pm, in the Greater Manila Area. “Our partnership with Move It is a hallmark expression of how transport stakeholders can come together for the common good, and we invite all companies to join us towards this mission,” said Grab Philippines head Grace Vera Cruz. Grab said statistics required by the Department of Transportation’s motorcycle taxi technical working group (TWG) will still be submitted. In 2020, Grab had said it was “seriously considering” entering the motorcycle taxi market “if given the chance.” The motorcycle taxi TWG, however, did not seem keen on granting authority to other players outside of the original participants in the government’s pilot study. Aside from Move It, Angkas and JoyRide were authorized to offer motorcycle ride-hailing services. The Philippine government allowed motorcycle ride-hailing services to augment transportation in Metro Manila starting October 2020, amid the limited options due to coronavirus restrictions. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/finance-and-industries/grabpay-perks/","title":"Still not using GrabPay? Here are the valuable perks you’re missing out on","date":"Sep 21, 2021 6:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Here’s one: There are no transfer fees","body":"Just like how the world has shifted into a more digital landscape, Filipinos have swiftly adapted to online transactions and cashless payments. Though it’s unfortunate that the pandemic served as a catalyst, it provided the right opportunity for most of us to take advantage of the convenience of e-wallets, such as no more pila (long lines), and being granted insta-access to bank accounts and due date-beating bills payment services, among other things. To be fair, all market players deliver on their promise; each one has its strengths depending on your needs. Consumers are now provided with a one-stop shop for their transactions, and seem to have an endless stream of deals. Banks are also stepping up their game, with their apps carrying e-wallet-like capabilities. (READ: Cashless payments 101: Starting out with a digital wallet) As with all bright and shiny things, everything isn’t spotless. With the increasing dependence on e-wallets and online banking comes a glaring compromise that we can’t escape from – those inconvenient “convenience fees.” Towards the latter part of 2020, we all watched in horror as PESONet and InstaPay slowly engulfed big names, leaving only a handful without fees. If you’re using one of the “affected” services, there seems to be no choice, and it’s hard to give up on their benefits. Or so we thought. How about considering GrabPay, the Grab app’s native e-wallet? Most of us are familiar with it as Grab’s preferred mode of payment on rides – a significant attempt to lessen physical contact between driver and passenger – but it’s so much more than that. Once you’re aware of its perks and advantages, you can harness it to become one of your most valuable digital wallet accounts. For starters, and perhaps its best feature, GrabPay has no convenience fee when you transfer to other banks and e-wallets, which saves you at least P15 per transaction. Likewise, you can spend less on those extra fees when you cash in from one of its partner institutions – BPI, BDO, and Unionbank – by simply linking your online banking account.  Pro-tip: You can turn your GrabPay wallet into a “halfway point” between accounts to avoid those insidious fees. If you have a BPI account, for example, cash in your intended amount to GrabPay, then transfer it to another bank. That way, you’ll regain that no lugi (loss) feeling that you once enjoyed. Is that possible? You best believe it. With each in-app or outside transaction that makes use of GrabPay as a mode of payment, you earn GrabRewards points! When accumulated, these can be used to save on future GrabCar rides, GrabFood orders, GrabMart groceries, and GrabExpress deliveries. There are even more perks awaiting as you progress the GrabRewards tiers – from “Member” all the way up to “Platinum.” You’ll gradually unlock and redeem more offers and prizes, such as free coupons, food items via GrabFood, and a premium Spotify subscription. If we’ve piqued your curiosity, know more about the hows of earning points, the tiering system, and the range of benefits by visiting the GrabRewards site. Most of all, by simply using GrabPay on purchases from its partner brands, including adidas, ShopSM, and Zalora, you’ll be able to shave off prices through loads of exclusive discounts. And lest we forget, your next Lazada or Shopee check-out sprees have been taken into consideration, making you eligible for up to P500 off in savings too. Just how sulit (worth it) can GrabPay be? We can’t thank e-wallets and online banking enough for making our transactions easier and faster at such an inconvenient time. But as you use one (or some), continue pushing your luck by going for a service that’s flexible, yields more value for your money, and leaves you without a lugi feeling. And GrabPay is the key. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/pageants/miss-world-philippines-2021-coronation-night-postponed-again/","title":"Miss World Philippines 2021 coronation night postponed again","date":"Sep 18, 2021 8:10 PM PHT","snippet":"The event on September 19 is not pushing through, and a new date has yet to be announced","body":"The Miss World Philippines (MWP) 2021 coronation night is not pushing through on Sunday, September 19, the MWP organization said in a Facebook post on Saturday, September 18. “The MWP Organization has yet to confirm the final coronation night date and venue, pending government and IATF mandate regarding the current COVID-19 scenario,” the organization said.

Specifically, senators found that on the same day that the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management requested Pharmally for a quotation for 500,000 face masks, they delivered these to the PS-DBM warehouse. In fact, the delivery happened in three hours.  In between were other unusual details: Pharmally didn’t have face masks in its inventory, and got them from another supplier. The delivery and payment were made even before a purchase order was placed by PS-DBM, with the agency paying P13 million, an amount higher than the P8 million initially approved for the purchase.  “It is not usual. Kalaki ng perang ito (There is huge money involved here),” Senator Franklin Drilon said.  “Parang Grab delivery lang, ano? Napakasimple,” Gordon said with a tinge of sarcasm. (Just like a Grab delivery, huh? That simple.) Senators said a timeline of Pharmally’s first delivery of 500,000 face masks to PS-DBM in early 2020 bolstered the findings they previously had:  Below is the timeline based on the information provided by Pharmally official Krizle Grace Mago and company director Linconn Ong on Monday, and the senators’ own research.  March 24, 2020 March 25, 2020 2:24 pm Asked by senators if this meant Pharmally itself did not have stocks on hand, Mago and Ong said this was true, but that it could secure items through Ong’s connections to suppliers.  “We don’t have the stock at our warehouse, but Mr. Ong negotiated with a supplier who [could] deliver [on the] same day,” Mago said. 5:19 pm  Senators Richard Gordon and Francis Pangilinan questioned the “same-day delivery” done just hours after Pharmally received a request for quotation.  This is when Gordon observed: “Parang Grab delivery lang, ano? Napakasimple.” (Just like a Grab delivery, huh? That simple.) March 26, 2020 Senators noted that Pharmally’s email reply via was sent the following day after those masks had been delivered to the PS-DBM warehouse.  April 6, 2020 April 15, 2020 Senators pointed out the amount was above the approved budget of P8 million earlier stated by the PS-DBM.  April 16, 2020 Senator Panfilo Lacson questioned why payment was made a day before the PS-DBM issued a purchase order on April 16, based on the COA’s records. Mago only answered that, based on Pharmally’s records, the PS-DBM’s purchase order was dated April 6, 2020.  Rappler on Monday checked the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) website for the purchase order for Pharmally’s 500,000 masks, but there was no record available. The website is where agencies are required to upload all awarded contracts during the pandemic.  This means the PS-DBM didn’t make public the contract with DBM, but COA had access to it and in fact flagged it as one of the expensive face masks supplies purchased by the PS-DBM. In past hearings, senators questioned whether Pharmally may have been awarded more contracts than indicated in publicly available records. So far, records show the firm has won at least P10 billion in pandemic deals, as of July 2021.  Gordon asked Lao if he had been able to check if Pharmally had a warehouse for its items or it if it could indeed supply its own masks, but Lao took cover under the government’s Bayanihan 1 law, which did not require for such measures.  For the Senate, issues raised involving Pharmally’s first order to the government is the latest show of the PS-DBM and Lao’s lack of due diligence. In earlier hearings, Lao conceded it was possible that negligence led to the purchase of overpriced face masks and face shields in 2020.  “The only challenge I had [to companies] was this: show proof you can deliver. What did Pharmally do? They delivered the items on March 25, 2020,” Lao said.  Hontiveros asked Mago if Pharmally had the four basic documents required in transactions like this. Mago admitted that they didn’t have a delivery order, the first requirement, before delivery was completed.  However, she said Pharmally had a delivery receipt, inspection and acceptance report, and statement of account.  According to Ong, Pharmally had bagged at least P11 billion worth of pandemic contracts as of 2021 – a figure that, lawmakers pointed out, amounted to about a fourth of the P41 billion the Department of Health transferred to the PS-DBM for the purchase of COVID-19 items.  – Rappler.com Read the other stories from the September 13, 2021, Senate blue ribbon committee hearing: "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/grabkitchen-branch-pasig-city/","title":"LOOK: GrabKitchen opens Pasig City branch","date":"Sep 7, 2021 7:38 AM PHT","snippet":"Order from 10 establishments – from Japanese food to milk tea – in one go","body":"Food delivery giant GrabFood recently launched its fifth GrabKitchen branch in Pasig City, allowing customers within range to order from different restaurants in one go.  GrabKitchen is a central commissary which allows several different food and beverage brands to prepare their products in one central kitchen.

Here are the top 10 Miss World Philippines 2021 finalists for Best in National Costume:  The Miss World Philippines 2021 coronation night is currently postponed indefinitely “until further notice.” It was initially scheduled for July 11. They moved it to July 25, then rescheduled it to August 8, before deciding to postpone the pageant indefinitely because of COVID-19 quarantine restrictions. Only seven titles are at stake during the coronation night, after Bataan’s Dindi Pajares was appointed Miss Supranational Philippines 2021. She finished as part of the top 12 at the Miss Supranational 2021 pageant night held in Poland on August 22.  The titles up for grabs are: Miss World Philippines, Miss Eco Philippines, Miss Eco Teen Philippines, Reinahispanoamericana Filipinas, Miss Multinational, Miss Philippines Tourism, and Miss Environment International.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-launches-covid-19-vaccination-center/","title":"Grab launches COVID-19 vaccination center","date":"Sep 1, 2021 12:01 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab riders and other economic frontliners can sign up to get a slot at the ride-hailing giant's vaccination center in Makati City","body":"Grab Philippines on Wednesday, September 1, launched its own coronavirus vaccination center at its office in Makati City. In partnership with the Makati City government, Grab aims to inoculate 200 to 400 people a day. Grab said the COVID-19 vaccines will be coming from the city government, but non-Makati residents are also welcome to register for inoculation. It partnered with Ayala Corporation subsidiary AC Health for vaccine administration. Grab public affairs director Booey Bonifacio said the ride-hailing giant is still waiting for the vaccines it procured. “Hopefully, when they arrive, we are able to use [them] while the vaccine center is still set up. At this point, we don’t have a definite date on when we can receive the supply that we ordered,” Bonifacio said. For the first two months of operations, the ride-hailing giant targets to vaccinate 7,000 economic frontliners, including Grab partners. Walk-ins are not allowed. Those interested will have to pre-register on the Grab microsite. So far, 60% of Grab drivers and 73% of its delivery partners have been vaccinated. “Majority are already vaccinated. Hopefully, with this new vaccine center, it will incentivize more of our drivers to get vaccinated and we hope to hit the 100% [vaccination rate] very soon,” Bonifacio said. Grab has launched several programs, including discounts for consumers and even rewards for drivers, to help ramp up inoculation. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/vladislav-artemiev-wesley-so-aimchess-us-rapid-tournament-august-29-2021/","title":"Artemiev grabs lead in Aimchess US Rapid, So trails","date":"Aug 30, 2021 4:04 PM PHT","snippet":"Shrugging off another faulty start, Wesley So stays close to the pacesetters and appears headed for his ninth straight quarterfinals stint in the Champions Chess Tour","body":"Russia’s rising star Vladislav Artemiev took control, while world champion Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian sustained their strong play in the Aimchess US Rapid Online tournament on Sunday, August 29 (Monday, August 30, Manila time).

Based on Comelec Resolution No. 10713 released on August 11, these include 77 national posts: 1 president, 1 vice president, 12 senators, and 63 party-list representatives. The rest are local seats: Most notably, the number of legislative district seats up for grabs rose to 253 in 2022 from 243 in 2019. That’s due to multiple redistricting laws passed in the 17th Congress and 18th Congress. These new districts are in Bulacan (2), Caloocan (1), Rizal (2), Bataan (1), and Southern Leyte (1). Santa Rosa City in Laguna, Mandaue City in Cebu, and General Santos City in South Cotabato are also classified as new congressional districts. The Comelec, however, has said it has yet to determine the allocation of the seats in the BARMM parliamentary elections due to the unavailability of the following: Congress has been working to consolidate bills seeking to postpone the 2022 BARMM elections due to the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in building the Bangsamoro government.

The US team, stacked with WNBA talent, defeated the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) 18-15 at the Aomi Urban Sports Park in Tokyo. Stefanie Dolson of the Chicago Sky led in scoring with 7 points. “Basketball runs deep in the USA and to pull this off and win gold is incredible,” Dolson said. “It just feels incredible. We achieved our goal.” Capping a back-and-forth match, Karlis Lasmanis hit a two-point jumper to seal the men’s victory for Latvia over the ROC, 21-18. The China women’s team prevailed over top-seeded France 16-14 to claim the bronze medal. Wang Lili was scintillating, delivering 9 points toward her team’s win. The men’s bronze went to Serbia after it dispatched Belgium, 21-10. Serbia had been heavily favored for gold, led by Dusan Domovic Bulut, the first real superstar of the new sport. “It’s a medal. We finished the tournament with a win,” Bulut said. “Better than losing in the final, no?” The team sailed through the pool stage with a perfect record, but could not get into a groove in the semi-final against ROC and lost by a surprisingly large margin, 10-21. The US women had been seeded low, as the squad of WNBA players had no record together on the 3×3 circuit. But their pro talent showed through, dispatching every team in the pool round except Japan. From the start, Latvia was a favorite for a medal, with a team featuring some of the world’s top-ranked players. A lackluster showing in the round-robin tournament cast doubt on their medal hopes, but the team gelled in the knockout stage. Along with skateboarding, surfing, and sport climbing, 3×3 has been added to these Games in an effort to broaden the spectacle’s youth appeal. French President Emmanuel Macron and US first lady Jill Biden cheered on their countrywomen on the first day of the tournament. With its debut at the Summer Olympics, 3×3 looked to boost its global profile as a faster-paced, more compact alternative to traditional basketball, with hip-hop music played by DJs throughout games to enhance the youth appeal.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-to-give-rewards-drivers-vaccinated-covid-19/","title":"Grab to give rewards for drivers who get vaccinated vs COVID-19","date":"Jul 27, 2021 6:30 PM PHT","snippet":"When all Grab drivers and delivery riders get vaccinated, the company will raffle off 30 Yamaha Aerox motorcycles","body":"Grab Philippines will be giving out rewards to ramp up COVID-19 vaccination among its drivers and delivery riders.

With the win, Choco Mucho tied up with powerhouse sister team Creamline Cool Smashers with identical 4-0 records while Cignal lagged behind further at 1-4. Kat Tolentino again led the way as Player of the Game with 17 excellent digs and 16 points off 14 attacks, a block, and an ace. Bea de Leon backstopped the effort with 11 points off 8 attacks, and 3 blocks, while Ponggay Gaston showcased more two-way play with 9 markers, 15 excellent digs, and 7 excellent receptions. Off a 10-8 lead in the do-or-die third set, Cignal saw its small advantage get vaporized as Choco Mucho mounted a game-sealing 16-5 run for the 24-15 gap, highlighted by a series of pinpoint attacks from Tolentino, Ponggay Gaston, and Maddie Madayag. Head coach Oliver Almadro is more than happy with their dominant showing, but noted that they still have a few more things to work out moving forward. “Slowly, they’re enjoying it. They’re having cohesiveness, but they have to do it right all the time. They need to be consistent. It only gets more difficult from here. I’m just telling them to keep the positivity all the time and to trust and help one another,” he said. That inconsistency indeed reared its head in the opening frame, where Cignal rallied from 8 points down, 3-11, to tie it up, 12-all. Choco Mucho needed an extension to win the first set, 26-24, but nonetheless got serious in the second, and crushed Cignal, 25-12. No HD Spiker tallied double-digit scoring in the brutal loss, with Roselyn Doria topscoring for the team with 9 points off 5 blocks, and 4 attacks. The Flying Titans will enjoy their place at the top for two more days before they take on a rising league underdog, the BaliPure Water Defenders on Friday, July 30, 1pm. Meanwhile, Cignal will try to get back on the winners’ side on Thursday, July 29, with a match against the rested but winless Perlas Spikers.  The Petro Gazz Angels also continued their rise up the standings with a four-set win, 25-12, 20-25, 25-21, 25-20, over the winless PLDT Home Fibr Power Hitters. With the win, the two-time 2019 finalists and Reinforced Conference champions rose to a 3-1 record, tied at third place with the Chery Tiggo Crossovers. Meanwhile, PLDT stayed rooted to the cellar with a 0-5 slate. Myla Pablo led all scorers with 24 points off 21 attacks and 3 blocks, while Ria Meneses backed her up with 16 markers off 12 attacks and 4 rejections. Veteran Chie Saet shored up the offense with 28 excellent sets, while star libero Kath Arado anchored the floor with 23 excellent digs, and 19 excellent receptions. With their backs against the wall in their search of a breakthrough win, PLDT fought hard deep into the fourth set, and only trailed by one, 16-17. However, their defenses suffered another late breakdown as the Angels soared to a 21-16 advantage with a 4-0 run capped by a Remy Palma block. Eli Soyud only made matters worse for the Power Hitters as she committed back-to-back attack errors to gift match point to Petro Gazz, 24-20, which Meneses gladly took advantage of as she ended the game with one last kill. Angels head coach Arnold Laniog sang praises for their opponents’ gutsy stand, but was nonetheless happy with his team’s win. “Talagang gustong kunin ng PLDT eh. Hanggang third set ultimo hanggang fourth set mararamdaman mo talagang gusto nilang lumaban, so ‘yun, respeto rin talaga. Buti na-control namin hanggang dulo,” he said. (PLDT really wanted to get this win. From the third until the fourth set, you could really feel that they wanted to fight, so all respect to them, really. Thankfully, we were able to control it until the end.) Isa Molde led the way in another sorry loss with 12 points, followed by 10 markers from Chin Basas. Petro Gazz will enjoy a three-day rest, the longest so far out of all teams in the condensed conference, before they face the Perlas Spikers on Friday, July 30, 4 pm.

Out of the crop of competitiors, only a handful of women will go home with a crown, a title, and a chance to represent the country on the international pageant circuit. The Miss World Philippines organization holds the franchise for eight international pageants – the most out of any major local pageant.  These are the titles at stake:  Currently held by Michelle Dee who was crowned in 2019, Miss World Philippines is arguably the biggest title up for grabs on coronation night. Whoever wins will be competing in Miss World 2021 – the 70th edition of the pageant – to be held in Puerto Rico in December. Miss World is among the “Big Four” pageants. Created in the United Kingdom, it is the oldest-running international beauty pageant, currently headed by Julia Morley. The reigning queen is Jamaica’s Toni-Ann Singh, and past titleholders include Indian actresses Priyanka Chopra and Aishwarya Rai. The Philippines currently has only one Miss World crown, won by Megan Young in 2013. The country has come close a few times: Catriona Gray’s Top 5 placement in 2016 (she would, of course, go on to win a more coveted international title – Miss Universe), Gwendoline Ruais’ 1st runner-up finish in 2011, Ruffa Gutierrez’s 2nd runner-up title in 1993, and Evangeline Pascual’s 1st runner-up win in 1973. In July 2020, Miss World Philippines acquired the Miss Supranational franchise, previously held by Binibining Pilipinas.  Miss Supranational was launched in 2009 in Poland, which has hosted the pageant many times. The current Miss Supranational titleholder is Anntonia Porsild of Thailand, who was crowned in 2019.  The Philippines brought home the Miss Supranational crown in 2013, through Mutya Datul.  Bataan’s Dindi Pajares was appointed as Miss Supranational Philippines 2021 by the Miss World Philippines organization. She finished as part of the Top 12 in the international pageant held in Poland in August.  The winner of this title will go on to compete in Miss Eco International, an Egypt-based pageant that places special focus on environmental awareness and eco-tourism. The current Miss Eco Philippines is Kelley Day, who won in 2019 and went on to place first runner-up in the international pageant. Thia Tomalla brought the Miss Eco International crown to the Philippines in 2018. Kelley Day came close with a first runner-up finish in April.  The reigning Miss Eco International is Gizzelle Uys of South Africa. The next edition of the pageant will be held in Egypt in March 2022. As the title suggests, only candidates aged 19 years old and below qualify for this crown. The winner goes on to represent the country in Miss Eco Teen International, the relatively new sister pageant of Miss Eco International, which held its first edition in 2019. The Miss Eco Teen Philippines crown has had quite the history with Filipina candidates. In 2019, it was awarded to Vanessa Mae Walters, who was later dethroned and replaced by Mary Daena Zaide Resurrecion. Mary went on to compete in the international pageant in 2019, ending with a Top 5 placement. In November 2020, the Miss World Philippines organization selected Roberta Tamondong to represent the country in the international pageant. She went on to become the competition’s second-ever winner, bringing home the Philippines’ first Miss Eco Teen International crown. The Bolivia-based pageant started in 1991 as Reina Sudamericana. It is meant to celebrate Hispanic heritage and culture, and only includes competitors from countries with historical ties to Spain. Winwyn Marquez became the first Reina Hispanoamericana Filipinas in 2017, and she would go on to win the international crown that same year. The title is currently held by Maria Katrina Llegado who finished as fifth runner-up in the international pageant. The current Reina Hispanoamericana titleholder is Mexico’s Regina Paredo, who was crowned in February 2020. The next pageant will be held in Bolivia in October. Isabelle de Leon currently holds the title of Miss Multinational Philippines, after being crowned in 2019, though she has yet to compete internationally due to the pageant being postponed several times. India-based Miss Multinational is a relatively new pageant. Its inaugural edition, held in February 2018, was won by Philippines’ Sophia Senoron, making her the first-ever Miss Multinational. The reigning queen is USA’s Daniela Nieto. Glyssa Perez became the first Miss Philippines Tourism in 2019 after the title was created in partnership with the Department of Tourism. The title isn’t yet assigned to an international pageant, though this may change in the future. Winners are meant to promote tourism in the country. This is another new crown under Miss World Philippines pageant. The winner of the title will compete in the first edition of Miss Environment International, which will be held in Mumbai, India in March 2022. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/volleyball/pvl-game-results-creamline-cool-smashers-petro-gazz-angels-july-20-2021/","title":"Creamline renews rivalry with Petro Gazz, survives 4-set thriller  ","date":"Jul 20, 2021 6:33 PM PHT","snippet":"Alyssa Valdez and Jia Morado power Creamline past tough-fighting rival Petro Gazz to grab a share of the  early PVL lead","body":"The Creamline Cool Smashers had to work for nearly every point as they eked out a grueling four-set win, 26-24, 26-28, 25-22, 25-20, over their Premier Volleyball League rival Petro Gazz Angels at the Bacarra, Ilocos Norte bubble. National team setter Jia Morado led the way as the Player of the Game with 35 excellent sets to go with 3 points. Team captain Alyssa Valdez triple-doubled with 16 points, 21 excellent digs, and 18 excellent receptions while Jeanette Panaga chipped in 15 markers. Creamline newcomer Tots Carlos also showed great potential in the win with 7 points off the bench in the latter two sets. The victory gave Creamline a share of the early lead with Chery Tiggo at 2-0. Off a drawn-out war in the first three frames, the Angels looked primed to force a fifth set decider after a torrid 11-4 start, capped by back-to-back Mean Mendrez points. However, Creamline dug deep and rallied right back with a 14-5 blitz to seize an 18-16 lead. Although Grethcel Soltones managed to inch her team within two, 20-22, Petro Gazz ultimately got their tanks drained before the finish line as multiple late errors swerved the game in the Cool Smashers’ favor for good. Ces Molina led the Angels’ valiant stand with 18 points while national team libero Kath Arado grinded out 26 excellent digs and 19 excellent receptions. After an exhausting affair, assistant coach Sherwin Meneses could only tip his hat to Creamline’s finals foe in the 2019 Open and Reinforced Conferences for yet another rivalry-worthy fight. “Siyempre Petro Gazz, ready din sila sa recruitment nila at maganda. Sana next time maganda laruin namin,” he said. (Of course, Petro Gazz is also ready and they did well in their recruitment. For us, hopefully we play better next game.) Both teams again showed that top-tier recruitment and balance in their rosters as they went back-and-forth in the crucial third set. After Petro Gazz started strong with a 7-0 attack for the 10-8 lead, Creamline struck right back with an 8-0 response to create a 16-10 gap. However, the Angels soared back up with another 7-0 spurt to take a momentary 17-16 lead before Carlos closed out the frame in Creamline’s favor, 25-22. Creamline will get a one day break from that whooping and will next try to protect their 22-game winning streak against Black Mamba Army on Thursday, July 22. Meanwhile, Petro Gazz will get two days off before pushing for a return to the win column against the Cignal HD Spikers on Friday, July 23. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/pdp-laban-power-grab-dangerous-playbook-philippine-political-parties/","title":"PDP-Laban power grab ‘dangerous’ playbook for PH politics – Pimentel","date":"Jul 20, 2021 11:58 AM PHT","snippet":"'If the other group wins then the power grab has been legitimized,' says Senator Koko Pimentel","body":"The power grab playing out in PDP-Laban and allowed by President Rodrigo Duterte is a cautionary tale for Philippine political parties and could do harm to democracy and electoral politics, said Senator Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III on Monday, July 19. In a Rappler Talk Newsmaker interview, he said that if the PDP-Laban faction led by Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi succeeds in getting recognition as the “legitimate” PDP-Laban, their moves could set a “dangerous” precedent for future power plays in other parties. “If the other group wins then the power grab has been legitimized. That’s very unusual and dangerous for other parties. It might be a playbook for other parties,” said Pimentel. The senator was ousted from his position in the party last July 17 by the Cusi group, with the blessing of no less than party chairman President Rodrigo Duterte. The Cusi group now says they are the real party officers because their election was witnessed by Duterte. The crisis in PDP-Laban could mean a deterioration of democracy under Duterte, who is already branded as a president with authoritarian tendencies by critics. Asked about the state of democracy under Duterte, Pimentel said, “If we will apply it now to our struggle, it depends now on who will emerge victorious. If our group emerges victorious then we can see the institutions will still be working and democracy is alive.” The Cusi group, however, is turning the tables on Pimentel. They insist that it was Pimentel who hijacked the party rules to maneuver party support for the presidential bid of Senator Manny Pacquiao. Members in the faction opposed how Pimentel named Pacquiao as his successor as party president last year without consultations or elections. They began holding assemblies without Pacquiao’s or Pimentel’s approval, including one meeting where they formally called on Duterte to run for vice president in 2022 and choose the party standard-bearer. That did not sit well with Pimentel who thinks the party should choose the standard-bearer first. But the bitter feud could have been easily resolved by Duterte as party chairman. It could have taken just one meeting called by him to unite the two groups or at least stop bitter public word wars. Duterte, however, is yet to call such a meeting. He could have ironed out disagreements during a meeting with Pacquiao in February or last July 6 when he was joined by Pimentel at a virtual conference organized by the Communist Party of China. According to Pimentel, Pacquiao has a pending request for a meeting with the President. If the meeting pushes through, the PDP-Laban stalwart said he would join. Pimentel is open to patching things up with the other group. “Allow us, give us some time to either resolve this or one possible result, not solution, and I’m hoping it will be a friendly parting of ways,” he said.  “If we have different opinions about who should be the next president of the country, who our bet should be, we should not take that too personally and destroy all of our personal relationships,” continued Pimentel. As to a legal battle on who gets to stand for PDP-Laban in the 2022 elections, Pimentel said the ball is in the other faction’s court. It’s them, he said, who has to prove they are the real PDP-Laban, because as far as he’s concerned, the status quo is his group as the real party. “They have the burden of proving they have done so [elect new officers] legitimately, properly, and in accordance with existing rules.

She first shared a five-minute video that showed several Grab food riders arriving at their house, all ordered by Manalo.  The video also includes a phone conversation between one of the riders and Manalo. “Sila po ‘yung umorder. Pakisabi diyan kay Kris Bernal, tingnan niya ‘yung Messenger niya. May umorder lang din sa’kin at dalhin daw sa bahay nila,” Manalo was heard saying in the clip.  (Tell Kris Bernal to check her Messenger. Someone just asked me to order and have it delivered at her house.)  Manalo added, “Ay nako, kuya, hindi ko na kasalanan ‘yan. Kasalanan ‘yan ni Kris Bernal.” (Oh my gosh Kuya, it’s not my fault. It’s Kris Bernal’s fault.)  The rider replied, “Hindi nga raw sila nagpa-order sainyo, ikaw lang ata panay ng order tapos dinadawit mo pa pangalan nila.” (They said that they didn’t order anything from you. It seems like you’re just making these orders and dragging their names.)  Bernal wrote in the caption that the amount of deliveries were no joke. “I’m not the only victim here but also the grab riders na nag-seserbisyo lamang (who are just working) and went all the way here to deliver several orders. I really feel bad for the riders’ efforts. This thing has been prevalent lately,” she said. In a separate post, Bernal said that she can’t think of anyone who would attack her like this. “I have no idea who did this and I can’t remember any incident that triggered this to happen. All I know is I didn’t do anything wrong to someone for me to deserve this kind of treatment.”  She added that she’s more worried about the riders who also suffered from this malicious act. “I really hope that there was even a bit of sympathy to the riders. They are the main victims here. I hope the person who did this will feel a bit of conscience.”  The actress also sought the help of netizens in reporting the scammer to authorities. “I’m sure this is not her real name. But this is the name and number that were recorded with all the deliveries today,” she said.  Bernal also revealed that this isn’t the first time it’s happened to her. She said that the Manalo has also pretended to be her assistant and asked for free products from the small businesses that the actress has promoted.  “Please be informed that I do not support any of these bogus buyers. Please do a cross checking and don’t allow them if they pretend to be my assistant and ask for free goods. I’ll never ask someone to order from me. I’ll order and buy it personally,” she said.  Several celebrities like Sanya Lopez, Shaira Diaz, Kakai Bautista, Tom Rodriguez, and Gian Magdangal commented on Bernal’s post to express their concern and disappointment over the incident.  “This is so dangerous. Sinisira nila ‘yung mga delivery service na sobrang nagpapakahirap sa trabaho (The delivery service riders are just doing their job and they’re the most affected). This should be reported to the police and get those numbers traced back,” Magdangal wrote.  On Sunday, July 4,  Bernal said in an Instagram story that Grab has contacted her about the incident. She also warned her fellow stars to be wary about giving out personal details.  “Apparently, she has done this to a lot of celebrities already. To my co-fellow artists, when you need to provide your address, try your best to provide a different address, name, and contact number,” Bernal said. Bernal is best known for her roles in GMA series’ Dear Uge: ’Till Death Do us Apart, Tadhana, and Impostora.   – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/grab-bayanihan-cheaper-rides-vaccination-centers/","title":"Grab launches cheaper rides to COVID-19 vaccination centers","date":"Jun 29, 2021 2:44 PM PHT","snippet":"The rides will also be driven by vaccinated drivers. There will be about 1,000 drivers in the new service","body":"Grab Philippines on Tuesday, June 29, announced the launch of a new service that would make it cheaper to book rides going to vaccination centers.  Called GrabCar Bayanihan, the service will be cheaper than the regular GrabCar 2-seater service, although specific rates were not mentioned.  There will be two types of Bayanihan: “GrabCar Bayanihan From” and “GrabCar Bayanihan To.” The former is what commuters will see on their app if they’re booking from the vaccination center to their desired destination. The latter is what commuters will see on the app when booking from their point of origin, going to the vaccination center. GrabCar Bayanihan rides are driven by vaccinated drivers, lessening the risk that a passenger will be infected by COVID-19 on the way to getting vaccinated.  To book the service, type the vaccination center you’ve registered to. Grab says it usually starts with the word “Vaccine.” Once the location is confirmed, tap the GrabCar Bayanihan option. Grab has a full list of locations serviced by GrabCar Bayanihan here.  There will be about 1,000 vaccinated drivers on the service, plying Manila, Las Pinas, Taguig, Pasig, Makati, Quezon City, Pateros, and Marikina.  Grab also said it plans to add more locations for the service. The program is part of Grab Philippines’ broader GrabBayanihan Vaccination Support Program. In July 2020, Grab also had a “GrabBayanihan Car” initiative, which offered subsidized rates for frontline healthcare workers.  “As we all work towards a safe and gradual recovery for our communities, Grab will continue to leverage its platform and technology to ensure that our kababayans have the means to get inoculated,” said Grab Philippines country head Grace Vera Cruz. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/southeast-asian-nations-missing-push-protect-planet/","title":"Southeast Asian nations missing from push to protect 30% of planet","date":"Jun 29, 2021 8:52 AM PHT","snippet":"Southeast Asian countries cover just 3% of the Earth's surface but are home to three of the world's 17 'megadiverse' countries – Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines","body":"A growing global push to safeguard nature by pledging to protect about a third of the planet’s land and oceans by 2030 will fall short unless biodiversity-rich Southeast Asian nations get behind the ambitious proposal, environmentalists have warned. Leaders of the G7 wealthy nations this month backed a coalition of about 60 countries that have already promised to conserve at least 30% of their land and oceans by 2030 (30×30) to curb climate change and the loss of plant and animal species. Cambodia is the only Southeast Asian nation to have signed up to the goal so far, although it has been endorsed by countries in other parts of Asia-Pacific, including Japan, Pakistan, and the Maldives. Brian O’Donnell, director of the US-based Campaign for Nature, which is calling on world leaders to back the pledge, said it was “very important” to get governments in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on board. “Given the incredible biodiversity in the region, much of which is facing pressure, ASEAN countries are a key voice to support 30×30,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Southeast Asian countries cover just 3% of the Earth’s surface but are home to three of the world’s 17 “megadiverse” countries – Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, according to the Campaign for Nature. These “megadiverse” nations have been identified by conservationists as being the richest in species, in a bid to raise awareness and spur protection efforts. Southeast Asia’s land and ocean contain 35% of mangrove forests and 30% of coral reefs, while more than 2,000 animal and plant species have been discovered there over the past two decades. The region is also home to about 18% of the world’s endangered species, according to the Campaign for Nature. In Indonesia, for example, the Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve is a high-priority conservation area and critical wildlife habitat, dubbed the “orangutan capital of the world,” while the endangered pygmy elephants live in the rainforests of Borneo. But several ASEAN countries are experiencing high deforestation rates, with Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos, and Cambodia among the top countries for primary forest loss, according to monitoring service Global Forest Watch. The 30×30 goal is included in the draft text of a new global treaty to protect the planet’s plants, animals, and ecosystems, due to be agreed at an October 11-24 summit in China, according to officials at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). But much of Southeast Asia is currently battling to contain a sharp rise in coronavirus cases, with new restrictions, business closures, and attempts to rapidly scale up vaccinations. The crisis has rightly become a higher priority for policymakers than nature conservation, said Ravi Sharma, a former CBD director, adding regional talks had also been disrupted. But research shows that maintaining intact ecosystems can help avert future infectious disease outbreaks, he added. Investing in nature and adopting policies for a green COVID-19 recovery could generate 395 million jobs and about $10 trillion in business opportunities by 2030, according to the World Economic Forum. But the economic benefits of biodiversity conservation are not yet clear to all of Southeast Asia’s political leaders, many of whom are relying on natural resources to lift their people out of poverty, green groups say. Malaysia and Indonesia are the top two producers of palm oil, the world’s most widely used edible oil, which environmentalists blame for forest destruction. “ASEAN countries are conscious that the actions needed for 30×30 would have economic implications as well as costs for implementation,” said Tony La Viña, a prominent Philippine environmental lawyer and activist. “These fears have a basis but can be overcome once they realise the long-term economic and development benefits of the goal, as well as identify the opportunities (it) would open up in terms of conservation and sustainable livelihoods,” he said. A delay in Southeast Asian nations backing the 30×30 target could be a tactic to secure more funding from richer countries to invest in nature, conservationists said. A key part of the pledge will be to respect the rights of indigenous groups and communities living in protected areas, many of whom play a vital role in conservation, said O’Donnell. Southeast Asian countries have developed innovative nature projects involving local communities and by joining the 30×30 group, they could lead that work, he added. The best incentive for them would be if the proposal included payments to local communities and indigenous peoples for looking after their natural environment, La Viña said. Biodiversity loss is directly linked to how rich nations have benefited economically from exploiting nature – and so they bear a greater responsibility for fixing the problem, said Arie Rompas, a forest campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia. But even ASEAN governments have often overlooked indigenous communities when pursuing economic growth, and have not done enough to guarantee their land tenure and other rights, he said. The 30×30 goal appears to have been developed without adequate consultation of indigenous and other local communities, he noted. International conservation efforts have a history of failing to recognize or address problems such as “green grabbing,” where land used by local people is set aside and may become off limits to them, said Amber Huff, a research fellow at the UK-based Institute of Development Studies. The global biodiversity and climate crises require action, but proposed solutions must tackle the root causes and accept that people can and do live sustainably alongside nature while making use of it for their livelihoods and wellbeing, she said. “Plans like the blanket 30×30 initiative will rob indigenous peoples and rural farmers, foragers, and fishing communities around the world of their lands and livelihoods in the name of environmental ‘restoration,'” she warned. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-suspends-delivery-riders-homophobic-posts-vs-bts/","title":"Grab suspends delivery riders over homophobic posts vs BTS","date":"Jun 18, 2021 3:06 PM PHT","snippet":"'Inclusivity is one of Grab's core values, and we have a zero-tolerance policy for inexcusable behaviors,' says Grab Philippines","body":"Superapp Grab Philippines said it suspended delivery riders involved in posting homophobic remarks against K-pop group BTS. “Inclusivity is one of Grab’s core values, and we have a zero-tolerance policy for inexcusable behaviors.

Tobias Harris (22 points) reached the 20-point plateau for the sixth straight game. He went 10-for-16 from the floor, helping the 76ers shoot a blistering 58.2% overall and 47.6% from three-point range (10-of-21). Simmons finished with 18 points and 7 assists, and Furkan Korkmaz scored 14 points, 11 of them in the first quarter. Korkmaz saw extended playing time in place of starter Danny Green, who left the game in the first quarter due to a right calf strain and did not return. Trae Young scored 16 of his 28 points in the first half for the Hawks, who saw their 13-game home winning streak come to a halt. John Collins added 23 points and Bogdan Bogdanovic had 19. Danilo Gallinari scored 17 points, and Clint Capela grabbed a game-high 16 rebounds. Ahead by five at halftime, Philadelphia bolted out of the blocks to begin the third quarter, making its first eight shots from the floor to secure an 80-62 lead.  Seth Curry drained a three-pointer and a pair of short jumpers to highlight the 76ers’ 19-6 spurt. Philadelphia pushed its advantage to 22 points in the fourth quarter before Atlanta scored 13 of the next 17 points to cut the deficit to 110-97 with 5:13 to play. Embiid was fouled on a drive and Young was whistled for a technical foul to halt the momentum. Earlier, Shake Milton sank a mid-range jumper and a triple to extend Philadelphia’s lead to 41-30 with 8:18 remaining in the second quarter. Atlanta trimmed the gap to 61-56 after Young made a driving layup just before halftime. Korkmaz’s big performance off the bench staked the 76ers to a 28-20 lead at the end of the first quarter. Korkmaz sank all three of his shots from the floor – including two from three-point range – and hit all three of his foul shots.

Gomez completed a scintillating comeback against Singaporean Aloysius Yapp, 11-7, in their race-to-11 duel as the 128-man field got trimmed down to the best 16 players.  Trailing 5-7, Gomez displayed his composure and won the next six games to stun Yapp and earn his fourth straight victory.  Earlier in the day, Gomez made quick work of South African Muhummed Daydat, 11-2, in their last 64 match.  “I’m really playing my A game today – breaking and running out good,” Gomez said. “I can see everything clearly.

The 19-year-old Filipino player drilled a long putt on her final hole for her sixth birdie of the day to drop to six-under par at the major, one clear of South Korea’s Lee6 Jeong-eun. “I love playing golf and am just thankful that I’m here,” said Saso, who said she models her swing after four-time men’s major champion Rory McIlroy. Jeong-eun nearly caught Saso at her last hole but her birdie putt died just short of the hole and the tournament’s 2019 champion had to settle for solo second place. “The course is not that easy but with my focus, attention and efforts, I think I can do better,” the South Korean player said of the sprawling oceanside course, which has been visited by dense coastal fog through the first two rounds. The Cinderella story of New Jersey high school student and overnight co-leader Megha Ganne seemed like it was destined to come crashing back to earth after two early bogeys in her morning round. But the 17-year-old amateur proved she is full of fight, mixing three birdies with bogeys to grab a share of third with fellow American Megan Khang, who she will be paired with on Saturday. “Once the first birdie goes in, it’s like you know more are coming,” she said. “So it’s a good feeling.” Ganne, who received encouragement from New Jersey governor Phil Murphy on Twitter on Friday, has committed to attend nearby Stanford University next year. The shot of the day came off the nine-iron of Jennifer Kupcho, whose tee shot on the par-three 13th bounced twice before disappearing into the cup for the first ace of this year’s tournament. The shot proved to be a momentum shifter for the American, who nailed two more birdies and avoided any bogeys the rest of the way to sit one-over par for the tournament and still very much in the mix. A dangerous group of experienced players lurk not far behind the leaders including 10-time LPGA tour winner Shanshan Feng of China, who is in fifth place after two solid rounds. Seven-time major winner Inbee Park, 11-time LPGA tour winner Lexi Thompson, and overnight co-leader Mel Reid are knotted at two-under in a share for sixth place and it would come as no surprise if any one of them were hoisting the trophy on Sunday. Defending champion A Lim Kim, 2014 champion Michelle Wie West and 2010 champion Paula Creamer were among those who missed the cut. This week marks the first time that the oldest women’s major has been played at The Olympic Club, a course that has hosted five US Opens.

It provoked criticisms of which the more reasonable, and printable, were that it was premature, thus unfair, given that Duterte had four years yet remaining of his six-year term. In any case, by then, I thought, he had made enough mess to warrant a warning being raised: I confess that I had hoped Duterte might be stopped before his term ended – but let me make it quickly clear that I had meant removal by constitutional means, lest an excuse be found to tag me under an anti-terrorism law that, although unable to even define the crime it punishes, is allowed to operate before the Supreme Court can rule on its constitutionality. If I had thought that anyone at all shared my feeling of disquiet and that my warning would make an impression, soon enough I would be proved kidding myself. Early the following year, Duterte’s team would grab all 12 Senate seats contested in the midterms, thus sealing the deal for him in the traditional bastion of oversight on executive power. The lower House itself, in a spectacle of turncoatism never seen in our politics, had been co-opted almost to a man (90-plus percent) from the very start, and the Supreme Court had proved agreeable in every case Duterte was interested in. His power further consolidated, the nation’s descent into authoritarianism, with its component militarization, proceeded apace.  And, most significantly economically, so did the Chinese entrenchment in the West Philippine Sea, our territorial waters Duterte had let go, in spite of all the mineral wealth that lies in their bowels. To be sure, Chinese entrenchment has not been limited offshore. The Chinese have landed in droves and been welcomed on such obsequious terms as might only be extended by a vassal state – usurious loans; contracts made lopsided not only by prohibitive straight costs but by the supply of Chinese workers, materials, and equipment even where we ourselves could provide them; gaming operations, with their criminal complements (loan sharking and prostitution); instant visas; tax breaks, if not outright write-offs of tax obligations. If, to some of us, China is the elephant in the room, it would appear only one of a herd, or not appear at all, to others. Such relative perceptions tend to be betrayed by the vote itself. Our elections are decided emotionally – that is, by popular mood, rather than rationally – by an understanding of the issues. The anomaly is rooted in a long-standing, criminally disproportionate distribution of wealth and opportunities, which has built up among the masses an anger for being trapped in poverty for generations. Desperate for quick fixes, they have become easy prey to false prophets, of whom Marcos and Duterte are the most dramatic examples. It seems to me\nthat the poor, precisely because of the desperate commonality and cause that\nbind them, are easier to bring together for a vote that holds even the most\nimplausible promise of instant redemption, while the non-poor can afford to\nbreak with the crowd and vote their individual consciences. The situation\nhas grown worse in recent years; it has lent itself to a new technology that is\nweaponized both for expressions of earnest and valid protest and for malevolent\nadvocacies built and run on fake news and other like concoctions. As a result,\nthe perceptions of truth have become even more confused. But I rather hopefully wonder if this pandemic, the worst managed in our parts, is not working as a blessing in disguise. I wonder if the truth the pandemic causes to be revealed still allows for relative perceptions of the elephant in the room. I don’t quite see the Duterte regime – a “czarist” regime, by its own unashamed self-naming – able to continue disguising its fraudulence, not from the masses, not in a pandemic. The misfortunes the pandemic brings are personal: joblessness, hunger, death, or at least a very real, daily risk of it. These misfortunes could have been minimized, if not prevented, but the regime is simply too inept, too arbitrary, too corrupt, and too hard-hearted to make a redeeming difference. I don’t know that the historic mess Duterte will have left will provoke enough awakened reaction for a competent and right-minded leadership to be elected in 2022, and, subsequently, for the previous regime to be held to account. Surely, anyone who has lived through contemporary history need not be told that everyone from the war collaborationists to the Marcoses to Estrada to Arroyo has gotten away. True, we’ve\nhad spells of prospectively, if not actually, good governance across those\nyears, but spells were precisely all they were, too fleeting to allow for\nreform, or even any serious beginnings of it. The inherent and persistent\nsocial inequity has never allowed for democratic institutions to take root, and\nthat’s why it has been easy to coopt what passes for them, and establish a\nregime of dynasticism and cronyism.  But then what do we do? We do with what we’re dealt, especially in a moral fight. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/game-results-hawks-vs-knicks-may-30-2021/","title":"Trae Young, Hawks grab 3-1 lead vs Knicks","date":"May 31, 2021 4:46 AM PHT","snippet":"The Hawks are a win away from reaching the Eastern Conference semifinals for the first time since 2016 after giving the Knicks a beating in Game 4","body":"Atlanta’s Trae Young torched the visiting New York Knicks for 27 points and led the Hawks to a 113-96 win in Game 4, giving them a 3-1 lead in the series on Sunday, May 30 (Monday, May 31, Manila time).  Young added 9 assists and made four three-pointers, raising his scoring total to 110 points in the series. Atlanta extended its home winning streak to 13 games, the longest active streak in the NBA. Hawks’ John Collins finished with 22 points and 8 rebounds and played the fourth quarter with a lip laceration suffered after being elbowed by Julius Randle. The foul was initially called on Collins, but the play was challenged by Atlanta coach Nate McMillan and overturned by replay.

Vera Cruz told Rappler that Grab has already procured vaccine shots for drivers, and delivery partners who will not be covered by the national vaccination program. “As of today, we have procured a number of doses,” Vera Cruz said without elaborating how many. “We are procuring as much as we can. However the timing of the delivery of that is still a question,” she added. Under the COVID-19 vaccination program, economic frontliners, including those in the commuter transport and delivery services, are part of the A4 priority group. Asked about how many drivers will have to be covered by Grab, Vera Cruz said she doesn’t have an idea at the moment.  “We are prepared for the worse but hoping for the best as Grab. We are trying our best to work with the regulators, national government and local government, to understand it. When we ask them the question, they’re also unclear as of this point,” Vera Cruz said.

Like many Filipinos, I still spend most of my days at home. Last year, this was definitely a challenge. Since I used to live on my own in Quezon City, it was difficult to adjust to living in my childhood home in Pampanga again.  Among the many challenges I faced – which you might relate to – is the lack of access to the food I used to enjoy. Here’s an example: when I lived in Quezon City, there was a Bon Chon near my workplace and the condo I lived in. In my Pampanga hometown, the nearest branch is 15 minutes away. If we pair this with the fact that going out of the house for non-essential tasks isn’t encouraged, I used to think that enjoying restaurant food wouldn’t be part of my quarantine experience. Thankfully, delivery apps and logistics services recognized this concern. Most of them have improved their operations – by extending service hours, widening coverage, and adding more partner restaurants – to cater to customers like me. Nowadays, I turn to delivery apps like Grab to satisfy my cravings or to buy essentials.  Of course, I’ve become a dedicated customer. I open the Grab app almost daily. I could probably already name most of the restaurants that are available on the app. Most of all, I’ve become familiar with our modern-day heroes, the delivery riders that regularly come to our home.  Whether it’s a rainy or extremely hot day, at breakfast or dinner time, or for small essentials like tube ice or large orders of Chinese food, these delivery riders make sure that I get what I order promptly. Most of them do it with smiles on their faces and with a kind word when I get my packages.  We’re all probably familiar with a few ways we can be nicer to our delivery riders. Some of the habits I practice as a customer include giving my riders even just a small tip, waiting for them near the gate to ensure quick deliveries, and properly communicating with them to minimize the risk of these riders getting lost on the way.  While these are helpful (and have proven to make these riders happy), I wondered if there was more that I could do to help them out. And it seems like Grab heard my thoughts.  One of the restaurants I always order from is Starbucks. One day, I noticed that the Starbucks store on the Grab app gained a new feature. They have included a “For your rider” tab, which now allows customers to buy food or drinks for their riders.  This is on top of the tipping feature, which enables customers to input a certain amount to give as a tip directly from the app itself. This will be deducted from the customer’s chosen payment method and is helpful for those who prefer contactless delivery since there is no need to physically hand over the tip.  Grab continues to implement programs for the benefit of its riders. Just this month, they rolled out a new feature under the Food for Your Drivers program. Until May 31, 2021, customers in select parts of Metro Manila can go to the Mart section of the Grab app and buy goods from select supermarkets and establishments for their delivery riders.  Partner stores and brands include:  Interested customers can also find the “For your driver” section of these select stores on the app.  Do you also enjoy these services offered by Grab?

The infected workers bring home the virus to different communities, making contact tracing difficult.","body":"Mandy* made it clear to her employers: she could only work from home. She lived with her husband and their two-year-old. Mandy had a heart condition, her daughter had bronchitis, while her husband worked as a delivery man for Grab. They shared a room for rent in Manila, making it impossible to isolate if at least one of them turned out positive for the novel coronavirus. Mandy was a call center agent. She knew she worked well. From the lockdown in March 2020 up to the renewed lockdown in April 2021, she has managed to stay afloat in the industry where companies have been pulling out left and right, leaving thousands of agents jobless. Mandy has worked for four clients, working from home in all transfers except the last one, located in Bonifacio Global City in Taguig City. She started in December 2020 and trained in January 2021. She said the recruits – her included – were led to believe that only the training would be onsite, until they were told to report for work when their regular shifts began. In protest, Mandy used up all her leave credits, effectively going on a break on her first month in March 2021. She took care of her daughter.  While at home, messages poured into her inbox.  One by one, her colleagues reported testing positive for COVID-19. Still, the company only locked down parts of its office. A positive case in the first floor meant that only the first floor was shut down. The rest had to continue.  When Mandy had to finally go earn money, she had to report to their office.  She returned on March 19. By the second week of April, she started coughing. The virus had reached her. The outbreak in Mandy’s office mirrored the spike in cases happening in the National Capital Region, the epicenter of the pandemic in the Philippines. In March 2021, NCR cities saw the infections spread doubly fast, and the Philippines saw a record-breaking rise in cases for days.  By the last week of March, the government decided to place the capital region and surrounding provinces on enhanced community quarantine, the strictest level of lockdown.  From January to April 2021 alone, the Philippines recorded over 500,000 cases, making up half of its first million cases since the pandemic started. Experts attributed the rapid rise to the reopening of the economy and the arrival of more infectious variants of COVID-19. The country’s economic managers argued for the reopening of businesses as employers and employees could not go on without their income. The distribution of aid has also left the money reserves of local governments dry. The national government could only give a maximum of P4,000 per poor household – certainly not enough for any family to survive on for weeks. In this trade-off, the virus spread among the country’s economic frontliners, the workers. According to contact tracers Rappler spoke with, transmission inside homes is the most common way COVID-19 spreads, but the spread of the virus in workplaces has become the most difficult to handle. Spread of the virus in the workplace is attributed to the following: Quezon City, the Philippines’ most populous city and the city with the most infections, has its own office monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in workplaces. According to Rolando Cruz, chief of the Quezon City Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Unit (CESU), the office was needed because of how difficult it was to track and contain the virus once it penetrates work spaces. “For community transmission, it’s easy: We find a cluster and we lock them down. That’s it. For the workplace, it is different. Everyone lives in different barangays. If you’re 10 infected in your workplace, those are 10 different barangays affected,” Cruz said. The result: Workplaces have become a hotspot for bringing COVID-19 to communities. Then, once the virus takes root in the communities, it spreads faster, especially in the congested areas. These workplaces involve not just private companies, but even government offices. From Malacañang, to the Congress, to the Supreme Court, offices have been closed off at one point or another. (READ: ‘Betrayal’: Gov’t staff decry COVID-19 violations at work as cases rise) In Quezon City, they have found that call centers make up most of the cases in workplaces.  The city has a concentration of business process outsourcing (BPO) companies in Araneta City and in Eastwood City, where agents flock to high-rise buildings with enclosed spaces. Quezon City’s tally of BPO workers who tested positive from January 1 to April 20, 2021, showed that most of those who tested positive are not only living in different barangays in QC, they also reside in other cities or provinces, making it harder for contact tracers to isolate them. Of the 511 confirmed cases in that period, 406 (79.45%) were found to reside outside, while only 105 (20.55%) lived in Quezon City. Hanzel Tolentino, a contact tracer in Quezon City, said both the companies and the employees shared the liability for the spread of the virus in their offices. He explained that, while companies insist on following health protocols, workers can only distance themselves from each other so much within their enclosed and shared spaces. A lot of workers also have little to no choice. Tolentino recalled an employee for a BPO company concealing symptoms out of fear of losing work. “It’s because of [the] no-work-no-pay policy, and their health cards do not cover testing,” Tolentino said. Hazel Campos, a nurse and contact tracer in Pasig City, said she saw malpractices in workplaces in the barangays she handled. This is especially true in private companies where employees work contractually. “There are reports coming to our office about companies who belatedly inform close contacts. There are also employees who hide their symptoms,” Campos said. She added: “We are a third-world country. The people need money. That is a factor why they hide their symptoms. If they declare they have symptoms, they are banned from work without compensation.” In an interview with Rappler, Labor Undersecretary Benjo Benavidez said employees could avail of sickness benefit from the Social Security System. He lamented, however, that not all employees are aware of this, or that they may not be covered in the first place to avail themselves of this. BPO companies employ thousands of Filipinos in the capital region and surrounding provinces. They rake in billions of dollars for the Philippine economy every year. Under the pandemic, their employees have been classified by government as “essential.” (READ: A history of the BPO industry in numbers) Mandy is one of those essential workers, and she says they have been taken for granted. She recalled that, during the early part of the pandemic, many BPO firms offered work-from-home arrangements, but, as the economy slowly reopened, more started pushing their employees to work onsite.  Mylene Cabalona, president of the BPO Industry Employees Network (BIEN) Pilipinas, stresses that the problems they face in their industry reflect what workers in other sectors face – employees live dangerously as employers push them to go to work. “We’re only asking for what we deserve. This is the state of our industry now: precarious. This is also what our brothers and sisters in other industries experience,” said Cabalona. Cabalona says call center agents find themselves in oppressive situations because there are no unions to represent them. She dispels the “misconception” that call center agents are “better off” compared to other workers. “We’re not represented, people don’t listen to us because they think we have it good,” Cabalona added. Cabalona’s group specifically flagged Department Order No. 215 of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), which allowed companies to float employees from 6 months to 12 months. This means that employees can still be under one company and not earn for as long as 12 months.  In an interview with Rappler, Labor Undersecretary Benavidez said the order was intended to protect employees because the order would allow companies to extend the employment of workers instead of firing them after six months. “Would you rather extend or outright lose your job? That’s the rationale behind that,” Benavidez said. Where does the government intervene in all of this? The DOLE crafts labor policies and enforces them. Under the pandemic, this has included policies to curb the spread of COVID-19 in workplaces. Benavidez admitted that they were severely undermanned to fulfill this role. Ideally, the DOLE visits workplaces to monitor whether employers are following quarantine rules. But their backlog appears to be insurmountable: The DOLE only has over 150 inspectors to monitor around 74,000 businesses in Metro Manila alone. These 150 inspectors also have no service vehicle and would have to plan their trips on their own and use the restricted public transportation. The DOLE also does not have a database of infections in workplaces to monitor trends and respond to them accordingly. At best, local governments keep track of them on their own, like in the case of Quezon City and Pasig City. Benavidez says data collection is the responsibility of the Department of Health. The DOLE managed to get a snapshot of the situation based on its visits. The department managed to visit 21,161 businesses from January 1 to April 22, 2021 – less than a third of the total number of establishments. It reported that 81.35% of the businesses complied with health protocols. Among those who failed to comply, the following make up the most common violations: An OSH program consists of the company drafting a plan for handling COVID-19 within the workplace and setting up a team of point persons in case the virus reaches their office. This means that thousands of workplaces do not have these contingencies in place. As for the enforcement of health protocols, the department confirmed the suspicions of health experts and the workers – that the spread of the virus in their workplace has a lot to do with ventilation. The DOLE issued Department Order No. 224, which mandates “stricter measures for adequate ventilation” in workplaces. The guidance was issued on March 3, 2021 – a year after the pandemic was declared. As the Philippines continues to be a laggard in pandemic recovery and immunization, workers still don’t see an end in sight in having to risk themselves and their families in order to earn money. Mandy recovered from COVID-19 on April 24. She counts herself lucky as she was finally allowed to work with relative safety.

Prin, who stunned top seed Susanto Megaranto of Indonesia in the first round Saturday, won a pawn and had Quizon on the defensive. But the 16-year-old Quizon, toughened by many games where he was on the ropes, dug in while Prin consumed lots of time to crack the Filipino teener’s defenses. Quizon offered a draw at the 15th move but Prin refused. Such was the intensity of their clash that Quizon and Prin had 30 minutes left before they reached 20 moves. The Thai cracked on the 29th move and Quizon forced the exchange of queens and entered an endgame where his two bishops were vastly superior to Prin, who quit after 44 moves of a Sicilian Defense.

This heavy-heartedness had nothing to do with any of that, but rather with the vaccine itself. It was the Chinese-made Sinovac, and it stirred up in him a struggle between science and country. As mayor of Navotas, Tiangco, 53, presides over a coastal suburban city of a quarter of a million who have lived off the sea largely. His own family owns a major fishing enterprise, equipped to work the farthest and deepest grounds west. The West Philippine Sea had been a prime national preserve until the Chinese began coming in greater and greater numbers and building demarcating structures and appropriating the sea. In the mid-nineties, with no help from the government coming to stop the Chinese, Tiangco’s family decided to fish elsewhere and went farther out in the Pacific.  “We simply let it go,” Tiangco told me, referring to both the official inaction and his family’s resignation. In 2012, the government of Benigno Aquino III took China to an arbitral tribunal established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Four years later, on the second week of Rodrigo Duterte’s succeeding presidency, in July 2016, the decision came down affirming the Philippines’ territorial claim on its mineral-rich and strategic western waters. But Duterte decided to let China, which refused to abide by the tribunal’s ruling, have a run of the place, saying he was buying peace. Forthwith China closed the place to non-Chinese fishers — including Filipinos — and explorers and even passing sailors, and began building islands and structures for military use. The work went apace little noticed amid the chaos of the pandemic.  Navotas, the most densely populated of the country’s towns and cities, has been one of the worst stricken. “Entire families here are getting [COVID-19],” Mayor Tiangco said. At the start of Holy Week, Navotas and the rest of Metro Manila were put inside a lockdown “bubble,” along with the four provinces contiguous with it. Early in the lockdown, 4 of 10 tested in the bubble proved positive, nearly 4% higher than the national rate (21.2%). With tests averaging only 34,000, a mere third of the passable 100,000, the situation has not improved. Indeed, after all the many lockdowns that came and went, the Philippines has failed to do any better against the pandemic. The latest rankings put it where it’s been locked in more or less from the start — second only to poorest-rated Indonesia in total cases, but leading it in per capita (0.7% and 0.5%). University of the Philippines statisticians are projecting a million cases at the end of the month. It’s more than 900,000 now, and hospitals, in Metro Manila particularly, are already short of space and medical hands.       Even so, the lockdown has been eased, allowing some cross-town movement, especially for people working subsistence jobs, but only because the national government cannot afford further subsidy. The P1,000 it budgeted for each of the 23 million poorest citizens in the bubble for those two weeks of lockdown was the last of it — the barest monthly income a family of five can make do with is put officially at P10,500. Apart from their paltriness, state subsidies have acquired a bad name. The first and only other subsidy for the pandemic, from P5,000 to P8,000 for each of the nation’s 18 million poorest households, began to be distributed in April 2020. The distribution was attended by such chaos and pilferage that by yearend intended beneficiaries were still complaining not having received their shares. In any case, having worried much about the psychological effect of the lockdown, Mayor Tiangco is thankful for its relaxation. “By now people should have known the even greater risks they’re taking going outside; hopefully they will be much more careful,” he says. He is also thankful that the vaccine is here, although the rollouts, as in most of Southeast Asia, have been slow and he would have preferred a non-Chinese brand. But again, he understood he was expected, especially at this time, to be an example to his constituency. So, he took his Sinovac, standing up for the science that applies to the pandemic and is preached by his own doctor — Take what vaccine is available — but only after he had put in a word of protest for country, which, as muted as it was, stood out in the general silence among local executives, who knew whom their vaccines were coming from. Baring “a heavy heart” to television news interviewer Karmina Constantino, Tiangco told her, “It’s all about the West Philippine Sea.” He said no more to her, and neither to me when I rang him about it. Proclamations of Chinese goodwill surrounding Sinovac, of which the first two Philippine deliveries, about half a million doses each, came free of charge, have, indeed, attracted much suspicion. A most vocal doubter — also a fierce advocate for a reassertion of Philippine sovereignty over the West Philippine Sea — is retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio. He warns of “strings attached” to the Chinese vaccine. A survey in March showed 6 in 10 Filipinos uninclined to be vaccinated, not necessarily with just Sinovac, although only Sinovac now remains available, the only brand the government has imported so far, despite its being rated as having one of the lowest efficacy rates (50%), not cheaper than most, and unideal for the particularly vulnerable elderly. In fact, Sinovac had been declared outright unsuitable for them, until the national Food and Drug Administration gave it its emergency approval last month. A vaccine developed at the University of Oxford, in the United Kingdom, did arrive, but as aid, on a World Health Organization humanitarian program. Also, it came in such a limited amount that by now half may have gone for the initial shots and the other half put in reserve for the complementary second. More of it has been promised, but only, similarly, in complimentary amounts and with no certain dates of arrival. Hard put admittedly to cope with the ever-raging pandemic and criticized roundly for favoring China, the government is now negotiating for “40 million doses” of the American vaccine from Pfizer, according to the man in charge of battling the pandemic and dealing for vaccines, the former armed forces chief Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr. Pfizer has offices and facilities in Metro Manila. Newspaper columnist Ceres Doyo said she had lined up for two hours in a Quezon City schoolhouse turned vaccination center for a promised AstraZeneca shot, only to be told on her turn that Sinovac was all that was left. She left unvaccinated. “I refuse to take a vaccine from an enemy,” she told me. “For every Sinovac vial, one square foot of the West Philippine Sea gets grabbed,” she added, quoting from her own column published in the Inquirer Thursday. The territorial issue has become decidedly bound up with the pandemic after the pandemic failed to distract from more than 200 Chinese Coast Guard and militia craft ominously massed in our Exclusive Economic Zone in the West Philippine Sea. The Philippines filed a series of diplomatic protests demanding their dispersal and, when these went unheeded, sent four warships, presently joined by the American aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt. In a further show of united force, American and Filipino troops have resumed military exercises under their countries’ Mutual Defense Treaty, which ultimately commits the US to come to the aid of the Philippines once it came under foreign attack.        On Tuesday, the Chinese dispersed, though leaving 10 boats.  Since his pivot to China, and through this latest confrontation, Duterte has said neither a critical word about China nor a friendly one about the United States, the deposed old ally. Now he’s saying he is helpless against China. Well, obviously, not his own foreign secretary, who first called out the Chinese on their trespassing fleet, and was joined by the defense secretary and the armed forces chief, and then by the Americans. A civic sign-up campaign calling on Duterte to resign was launched in the thick of the confrontation, precisely for his helplessness, though not only against China but also against the pandemic. It collected more than 50,000 signatures in the first three days; it is still snowballing.   I asked Mayor Toby Tiangco what he made of all this, and he replied, “All I can say is, I took Sinovac with a heavy heart.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/alexei-navalny-jail-health-update-april-19-2021/","title":"Navalny camp awaits health update, says there’s ‘no hope of good news’","date":"Apr 19, 2021 4:12 PM PHT","snippet":"(1st UPDATE) Josep Borrell, the European Union's top diplomat, describes Alexei Navalny's situation as 'very worrisome,' adding Russia must provide treatment","body":"An ally of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said on Monday, April 19, she was braced for bad news on the health of the hunger-striking opposition politician when his lawyers see him again, after they were kept away over the weekend. Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, started refusing food on March 31 in protest at what he said was the refusal of prison authorities to provide him with adequate medical care for acute leg and back pain. “We don’t know what happened to him over the weekend because the lawyers aren’t allowed to visit him then. I hope we will get some news today but I’m very afraid to receive bad news,” his ally, Lyubov Sobol, told Ekho Moskvy radio station. “I think there is no hope we will receive good news about his health today. I think his state is really very close to critical, close to being very grave. Twenty days on hunger strike – that is an awful lot.” Navalny’s allies said at the weekend his life was hanging by a thread, and announced plans for what they hope will be the largest protests in modern Russian history on Wednesday. The fate of 44-year-old Navalny is adding to already severe strains in Russia’s ties with the West. U.S. President Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that the government had told Russia “there will be consequences” if Navalny dies in prison. European Union foreign ministers are expected to discuss the Navalny case on Monday. Josep Borrell, the bloc’s top diplomat, described his situation as “very worrisome” and said Russia must provide treatment. “We make the Russian authorities responsible for the health situation of Mr Navalny,” Borrell said in a video statement. A medical trade union with ties to Navalny said on Saturday he was in a critical condition, citing medical tests which it said showed that Navalny’s kidneys could soon fail, which could lead to cardiac arrest. A regional opposition politician, Lev Shlosberg, said on Facebook that more than 20,000 people had signed an online petition demanding “access for competent doctors to Alexei Navalny and the release of all political prisoners in Russia”. Navalny has said prison authorities are threatening to put him in a straitjacket to force-feed him. Russian authorities accuse him of exaggerating his medical condition to grab attention, and of refusing prison medical care. They have pledged to ensure he survives. Navalny traveled to Germany last August for treatment after being poisoned by a nerve agent in an attack he blamed on Putin. The Kremlin has said it has seen no evidence he was poisoned and has denied any Russian role if he was. He was arrested in January when he returned to Russia and jailed for 2-1/2 years in February for parole violations he said were fabricated. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/grab-considering-secondary-singapore-listing/","title":"Grab considering secondary Singapore listing after US SPAC merger – sources","date":"Apr 16, 2021 3:11 PM PHT","snippet":"Listing on Singapore Exchange would enable Grab to have an investor base close to where its regional business is based, 3 sources say","body":"Grab Holdings, Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing to delivery giant, is considering a secondary listing in its home market of Singapore after completing a Nasdaq listing via a $40 billion SPAC merger, 3 sources familiar with the matter said. Listing on Singapore Exchange would enable Grab to have an investor base close to where its regional business is based, the people said, potentially offering its customers, drivers and merchant partners easier access to trade its shares. Grab, a household name across Southeast Asia, is in the early stages of considering a secondary listing in the city-state, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the matter. The potential Singapore listing plans come after Grab this week agreed to a $40 billion merger with Altimeter Growth Corporation, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), making this the world’s biggest SPAC deal. Grab, which began as a ride-hailing business in 2012, now operates in 8 countries and more than 400 cities and has expanded into food and grocery deliveries, as well as digital payments. Last year, it won a digital banking license in Singapore. It wasn’t clear how much Grab might aim to raise in any secondary listing, with financial terms and timetable still in the early stages of consideration, the sources said. The company with the top valuation on the Singapore bourse is bank DBS Group Ltd, currently worth about S$74 billion ($55.4 billion) by capitalization. Grab and SGX declined to comment on the listing plans. One of the sources said that while Grab has sufficient cash reserves and could end up raising only a small amount on SGX, a listing would mark a big win for the exchange. SGX has mainly only seen large IPOs from real estate investment trusts. Hindered by a small base of retail investors in the city-state, it has struggled with low liquidity and valuations, forcing a spate of delistings and also discouraging big-ticket listings from regional high-growth companies. The Hong Kong bourse, however, has benefited from diplomatic and political tensions between the United States and China that have led many Chinese firms to seek secondary listings in Hong Kong. Global fund managers have also been swapping China holdings from Wall Street to Hong Kong. SGX has taken many steps to try to bulk up its stock market in recent years, and under Chief Executive Loh Boon Chye, who was appointed six years ago, it has acquired firms to transform itself into a multi-asset exchange.

The merger, the biggest blank-check company deal ever, underscores the frenzy on Wall Street as shell firms have raised $99 billion in the United States so far this year after a record $83 billion in 2020. Singapore-based Grab’s agreement with a special purpose acquisition company backed by Altimeter Capital includes a more than $4 billion private investment in public equity by investors including BlackRock, Fidelity International, Janus Henderson Investors, and Temasek Holdings. The offering is led by $750 million from funds managed by Altimeter Capital. The transactions will provide Grab with about $4.5 billion in cash proceeds. Grab said its decision to become a public company was driven by a strong financial performance in 2020, despite the pandemic. Reuters earlier reported that Grab would announce the deal on Tuesday. The deals for Grab, which was valued at just over $16 billion last year, will be a big win for its early backers such as SoftBank Group Corp and China’s Didi Chuxing. The bumper valuation validates Grab’s co-founder Anthony Tan’s strategy to aggressively tap growth in new sectors and ramp up market share by pumping billions of dollars to localize its services and invest in high-growth economies. The proposed transactions, which have been approved by the boards of both Grab and Altimeter Growth, are expected to close over the next few months, subject to shareholder approvals Grab attracted global attention in 2018 when it acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia business after a costly five-year battle and in return took a stake in the company. Reuters reported in January that Grab, which has so far raised about $12 billion, was exploring a US listing. Grab’s agreed transaction will surpass electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors’ $24 billion deal struck with a SPAC in February. With operations in 8 countries and 398 cities, Grab is already Southeast Asia’s most valuable start-up. Leveraging its ride-hailing business started in 2012, the firm has moved into food and grocery deliveries, courier services, digital payments, and is now making a push into insurance and lending in a region of 650 million people. The listing will give Grab extra firepower in its main market, Indonesia, where local rival Gojek is close to sealing a merger with the country’s leading e-commerce business, Tokopedia. Grab, whose net revenue surged 70% last year, has yet to turn profitable, but it expects its biggest segment – the food delivery business – to break even by end-2021, as more consumers shift to online food delivery after the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash-rich, US-listed Sea is also muscling into food delivery and financial services in Indonesia. Both Grab and Sea won digital bank licences in Singapore last year. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-cover-covid-19-vaccination-drivers-delivery-partners/","title":"Grab to cover COVID-19 vaccination of drivers, delivery partners","date":"Apr 8, 2021 7:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Group CEO Anthony Tan says the GrabForGood Fund will begin 'immediate work on meeting the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines' in Southeast Asia","body":"Singapore-listed Grab Holdings announced on Thursday, April 8, that an initial $275-million endowment fund will be used to support its stakeholders over the long haul. Under the GrabForGood fund, Grab will fully cover the costs of COVID-19 vaccination for its drivers and delivery partners across Southeast Asia who are not covered by a national vaccination program. “The GrabForGood Fund will commence immediate work on meeting the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, where it’s not easily available,” said Grab Group chief executive officer and co-founder Anthony Tan. Grab said eligible drivers and delivery partners are those who have completed a ride or a delivery on the Grab app within 3 months leading up to inoculation. “Grab has started sourcing for vaccines and will look into setting up vaccine centers to inoculate eligible partners locally,” it said in a statement. Aside from the vaccine drive, Grab will also support other initiatives to ensure the sustainability of the endowment fund. Grab is planning an insurance subsidy for drivers and riders on top of the personal accident insurance coverage, education scholarships, and financial aid for people with disability to enable the use of the app for income generation. The holding firm said details of the initiatives will be announced eventually. The rest of the Grab community in Southeast Asia will also be able to access programs on financial and digital literacy, climate change resiliency grants, and catastrophic relief aid. The GrabForGood Fund will have a seed fund of $50 million in cash and $200 million in expected value of Grab shares. Tan, along with Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling and Grab president Ming Maa, also pledged a combined $25 million worth of shares as personal contribution. An advisory board will be created to give Grab partners and users representation in providing feedback and recommendations on how the funds should be spent. In the Philippines, Grab has already launched programs that support online sellers and small businesses amid the pandemic. It also covers swab tests for drivers and delivery partners.

The loss in 2020 of 4.2 million hectares (10.4 million acres) of primary forest – intact areas of old-growth trees – equalled the size of the Netherlands, according to data from Global Forest Watch (GFW) and the University of Maryland. “2020 was supposed to be this landmark year for all of these international commitments … and actually we’re seeing things moving in the wrong direction,” said Mikaela Weisse, a project manager at the GFW forest monitoring service, run by the World Resources Institute (WRI), a Washington-based think-tank. A group of global household brands missed a 2020 target to buy only sustainably produced commodities, while a goal backed by more than 200 countries, companies and green groups to cut natural forest loss by at least half by 2020 was not met. The “relentless pace” of deforestation across the tropics is “definitely something we’re worried about,” Weisse told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Cutting down forests has major implications for global goals to curb climate change, as trees absorb about a third of the planet-warming carbon emissions produced worldwide. Forests also provide food and livelihoods for people living in or near them, are an essential habitat for wildlife, and aid tropical rainfall. WRI said primary forest loss, which hit a record high in 2016 and 2017, was about 12% higher in 2020 than in 2019. It produced the equivalent of the annual carbon emissions of 570 million cars, more than double the number of U.S. vehicles. Agricultural expansion, wildfires, logging, mining and population growth all fuel deforestation, researchers said. In 2020, weaker law enforcement due to COVID-19 lockdowns, funding cuts for forest protection and an exodus from cities to rural areas had been expected to worsen deforestation. But Weisse said it had been hard to identify a pandemic influence. Still, as countries look to kick-start their economies after the COVID-19 crisis, they could introduce new policies that are not forest-friendly, she warned, citing an Indonesian job creation bill passed in late 2020. “Ultimately that’s going to have a longer-term impact than this shorter shutdown period we’re seeing now,” she added. The top 3 countries for primary forest loss last year were Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Bolivia, WRI researchers said. Brazil once more topped the list for annual primary forest loss with 1.7 million hectares in 2020, more than 3 times the next-highest country and a hike of 25% from 2019, they said. Weisse blamed much of the loss on forest fires and noted federal forest enforcement agencies faced budget cuts in 2021. Neighboring Bolivia rose to No. 3 with nearly 276,900 hectares lost, mainly due to fires. As in Brazil, most fires were likely set by people to clear land but burned out of control due to drought and hot weather. Meanwhile, in Colombia, ranked sixth, primary forest loss rose in 2020 to nearly 166,500 hectares after a dip in 2019. “There is a lot of land grabbing,” Weisse said. The DRC, in second place, lost 490,000 hectares of primary forest in 2020. Like previous years, the majority was caused by the expansion of small-scale agriculture and wood energy demand, including charcoal production. Indonesia, which has the world’s third-largest tropical forests and is its largest oil-palm grower, fell from third to fourth place with primary forest loss at just over 270,000 hectares, showing a fourth straight year of declines. The fall was down to government policies including a moratorium on clearing primary forest and a freeze on permits for oil palm plantations, improvements in law enforcement and land rights, and use of technologies to tackle forest fires, said Arief Wijaya, forests senior manager at WRI Indonesia. Forest loss also dropped for the fourth year in neighboring Malaysia, ranked ninth place, to nearly 73,000 hectares. Malaysia, which has lost nearly a fifth of its primary forest since 2001, set a five-year cap on palm oil plantations in 2019 and plans to toughen forest laws by increasing fines and jail terms for illegal logging. The downward trend in Indonesia and Malaysia was not visible in other Southeast Asian countries, however, with Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar showing sustained or higher levels of deforestation. “We are seeing these pretty significant declines in both Indonesia and Malaysia that really aren’t playing out in other parts of the world,” said Weisse. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/democracy-fragile-southeast-asia-sliding-backwards/","title":"Democracy has always been fragile in Southeast Asia. Now, it may be sliding backwards.","date":"Mar 31, 2021 10:36 AM PHT","snippet":"[Cheating], vote buying, and rigging the ballot box are common features in Southeast Asian elections — they are sometimes seen as justified to get the 'right' kind of leaders","body":"Just five years ago, many people were optimistic that Southeast Asia had finally turned the corner when it comes to democracy. Myanmar’s military had finally loosened its decades-long grip on power when Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won elections in 2015. Three years later, Malaysia’s opposition party swept the long-serving Barisan Nasional from power — the first regime change in the country since independence in 1957. These were seismic political shifts. More importantly, both changes in power took place after free, albeit not completely fair, elections. There was no bloodshed involved. Today, that optimism has gone. Much of the world’s attention has been on Myanmar’s implosion following the military coup in early February, which has resulted in scores of civilian killings and disappearances. But democracy has been rolling back across the region. In Thailand, we are seeing the return to a monarchy-military rule with the new king, Maha Vajiralongkorn, demanding changes to the constitution to grab more executive powers for himself and take direct control of Crown Property Bureau, which manages the royal fortune. In the process, he has become one of the richest monarchs in the world, with wealth estimated at between $60-70 billion. Crackdowns under Thailand’s infamous lese-majeste law (better known as 112) have intensified. People are regularly targeted under the laws for anti-monarchy social media posts, and last year, the government took legal action against Facebook and Twitter for ignoring requests to remove content it deemed against the law. Worryingly, several prominent Thai dissidents have also died mysteriously in neighbouring countries. In the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte took power in June 2016 and started a popular campaign against drugs that has led to the deaths of some 12,000 people. Duterte has also gone after the media for reporting on the killings, with one high-profile government critic being found guilty of libel last year. The country’s largest broadcast network, ABS-CBN, was shut down by allies of Duterte in Congress, as well. Optimism over the Malaysian Spring is completely gone. A year ago, the reformist Pakatan Harapan government collapsed and a new, all Malay-Islamic coalition came to power. Given Malaysia’s multi-ethnic and multi-religious society, this backdoor establishment of Perikatan Nasional is not a positive sign for democracy. Then, last month, the government declared a state of emergency and suspended parliament for six months. Many believed this was done to prevent the opposition from mounting a challenge to the new government. Singapore, the richest state in the region, stubbornly remains under the stranglehold of the People’s Action Party, which just won another election last year. The PAP has been in continuous power since 1959. The only bright spot in the region appears to be Indonesia. But there are dark clouds on the horizon. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo appears to be backtracking on reforms and pandering to the Islamists, who are keen to make Indonesia into a quasi-Islamic state. All this is happening in the midst of China’s determination to position itself as the dominant power in Southeast Asia. Beijing has sent a clear message that it does not really care what sorts of regimes or political systems are running the countries of Southeast Asia, as long as they acknowledge China as the undisputed regional power and do not question its sovereignty over the South China Sea. This, of course, has indirectly strengthened the hand of the anti-democratic forces in the region, with some openly admiring the Chinese “strong state” system. The pro-democracy camp, meanwhile, faces a sizeable dilemma. On the one hand, its supporters have been hoping for more help from the West, principally the US and Australia, to promote democracy in the region. On the other, they are worried they could be accused of being Western agents, driving people into the hands of the autocrats trumpeting populist nationalism. Another challenge is the diversity of Southeast Asia. There is no single template or historical model for a stable and democratic political system in the region. Most of the countries were colonized by European powers, who imposed their different political ideas on the societies they controlled. The one thing the colonial rulers did not do was promote democracy. They only did this after their former colonies became independent. And by global standards, many of the nations in Southeast Asia are relatively young. Most of them were created after the second world war, and their boundaries and political systems were largely decided by their colonial masters. This means the process of nation-building is ongoing, and the West should not assume these countries naturally aim to build liberal democracies. In many of these countries, traditional power — often autocratic, feudal, and authoritarian — lies just beneath the surface. In fact, many elites within them have ambivalent attitudes towards liberal democracy. While they accept the concept of mass elections to choose political leaders, they also believe in the concept of “guided” leadership to elect the “right” kind of leaders. Indonesia’s first leader post-indendepence, Sukarno, for example, was famous for practicing a “guided democracy,” in which the government would force a political consensus and ensure elections were used to legitimize leaders hand-picked by the regime. This is why cheating, vote buying, and rigging the ballot box are common features in Southeast Asian elections — they are sometimes seen as justified to get the “right” kind of leaders. There are no easy answers to the promotion of real democracy in Southeast Asia. We may simply have to wait for a generational shift before this takes root in the region. Young people do yearn for real democracy, but at the moment, they do not hold the guns or control the parliament. – Rappler.com James Chin is a Professor of Asian Studies, University of Tasmania.

Like any number of things we ought to not have overlooked, Palawan’s place in the national consciousness may itself have been hijacked in the pandemic. But, deathly consuming as it is, the pandemic is no more to blame for anything than any of the natural disasters visited upon this land all too often. And if we feel at all consoled that this time we have all of the rest of world for company in misery, we must be really, desperately disposed to be so distracted. To be sure, the pandemic has worked for the Duterte regime as a distraction – a distraction from an ineptness compounded by corruption. But that does not free us from blame ourselves.   If the message of Palawan is missed, such dimness is due not only to the pandemic; it goes back five years to the lack of moral discernment in the vote that licensed Duterte to insert himself so pervasively into our life. And now that he has made a spectacular mess of it, we’re unable to get up the moral courage to stick it to him.    Oh, don’t we need the haunting allegory of Palawan! Palawan is a province known for the great wealth in its earth and waters. It is 20 times the land size of Metro Manila, its population less than a tenth. A plot had been railroaded through Congress to dismember the province into three, and last week it went to a plebiscite, again railroaded: the process skipped public consultations that easily would have revealed the plotters for their self-interest. All they could present for their case was a flimsy promise of devolution, an abstract virtue to be taken on faith: it would make governance more efficient and the distribution of resources and opportunities more equitable.   But just as well. A quick-discerning civic offensive took care of things – the plot was defeated resoundingly. Known as more businessman than public servant, in fact the Philippines’ richest official, the governor of Palawan and chief plotter of its dismemberment, Jose Alvarez, was quick to concede the vote, doubtless looking to cut his losses. Alvarez made his main money in logging in Indonesia in the seventies, before coming to Palawan – for more logging. Forests being a much abused natural resource, he operated under heavy suspicion. Allegations of vote-buying tainted his own elections. First voted governor in 2013, he is now on his third term, the last allowed by law. When he bet on dismemberment, the prospects for Palawan in the geopolitical context could not have been lost on him as both businessman and politician: the entire length of the province’s western coastline meets the national territorial sea Duterte has ceded to China. But, obviously, neither are those same prospects lost on the province’s electorate, except that it regards them in the nobler, communal sense. The national case – our case – is no different: China as a foreign overlord and a federation of dynastic vassalages under it are the equivalent sinister twins in a Duterte plot disguised as federalization. A plebiscite may be too late to call for its ratification, but the national elections of 2022 present another chance – a make-or-break chance. Indeed, they constitute an existential reckoning: he or us. A presidential victory for a Duterte surrogate not only spares him jail but perpetuates his murderous, corrupt, and treasonous regime. It works as the ultimate spike in a political pandemic. But Palawan had come and gone scarcely looked upon in any hopeful or significantly relevant way – the analogy was lost on the nation. It was depressing. Then came a sudden lift Thursday. Thursday the 18th, is three days past but, for a sucker for signs like me, close enough to the Ides of March. The Ides is notorious for the assassination of Julius Caesar and notable, too, as the deadline for settling debts in the Roman times. It grabs me on both counts. The lift came from the launch of 1Sambayan, an initiative for uniting all forces against Duterte around one candidate for 2022. Simple-sounding yet ungainsayable as the strategy may be, it’s not one easy to pull off in this culture, where pluralism is taken more in the context of to each one’s own than in that of coexistence. But the 1Sambayan crowd looked widely varied, willing to coexist, and driven by a proper urgency. And, with such chief elders behind the initiative as former Supreme Court Justices Antonio Carpio and Conchita Carpio-Morales and former Foreign Secretary Alberto del Rosario, there cannot be a more credible, hopeful, and promising attempt at redemption from Duterte. If still Palawan got not even a passing mention, it seemed to live in spirit. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/anish-giri-stuns-magnus-carlsen-wesley-so-grab-invitational-lead-march-2021/","title":"Giri stuns Carlsen, So, grabs Invitational lead","date":"Mar 14, 2021 12:30 PM PHT","snippet":"World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen and reigning US champion Wesley So surprisingly yield to Dutch Anish Giri","body":"Anish Giri bested world champion Magnus Carlsen and United States champion Wesley So in succession to highlight a three-win run that pushed the Dutch on top of the preliminary phase in the Magnus Carlsen Invitational.

But what has made the news around the world recently is that the Australian government has attempted to do something about it. It has passed a new law forcing organizations such as Facebook and Google, which make a great deal of money out of carrying news material on their platforms, to share their advertising revenue with media organizations. Facebook incurred a worldwide backlash by temporarily blocking all news sites for users in Australia. Google, meanwhile, took the opposite tack by signing early agreements with the country’s key media players. Facebook has now also pledged to strike deals with Australia’s leading news companies in return for allowing its users to post their content on its pages. But if the purpose of the new law is to serve democracy by supporting public interest journalism, how well will it work? The wholesale movement of revenue from media outlets employing professional journalists to content platforms which produce no original stories is a major international problem. Social media doesn’t just reduce funding for professional journalism, it also enables the spread of fake news that rapidly fills the gap left behind. It’s a problem that has been obscured by social media’s many other issues: bullying, use by criminal groups, and disturbing, exploitative, violent and pornographic content. But in fact, how advertising income breaks down has much deeper implications. Digital advertising spend is continuously increasing, but about 40% goes to Google, with Facebook in second place at about 22% and closing the gap. Meanwhile, local newspapers have watched as their property advertising has disappeared to Rightmove and their classified ads to Ebay and Facebook. As for job ads, which were such good moneyspinners for local and national newspapers, they have migrated mainly to CV upload sites, such as LinkedIn. To maintain visibility in the new digital world, news organisations have to be present on social media platforms – which simply means more eyeballs for the likes of Facebook and Twitter. Deprived of advertising revenue, traditional news organisations are in seemingly unstoppable decline – not just in the UK, but around the world. In the UK, 265 titles have closed since 2005 – with COVID-19 proving the final nail in the coffin for some. The Australian initiative attempts to mitigate against tech giants siphoning off all digital revenue – but a major and valid criticism is that the deal appears to be skewed in favor of large media organizations. Funds also need to be made available to support independent local news organizations. The imbalance is already visible. Google preempted the new law by reaching agreements to pay seven Australian media organizations, including Rupert Murdoch’s considerable newspaper and TV empire. But there’s concern that the grassroots organizations that provide most public service news are unlikely to benefit without the massive influence of the nationals. Google has also agreed to pay for use of news snippets in Google News search results from some publishers in France – but so far only to a handful of major national organizations as well as the international news agency Reuters. Again, the agreement looks set to benefit the biggest players the most, since one of the criteria is monthly traffic. Reuters’ French rival AFP has already complained. Why does this matter? Research has shown clear links between a loss of journalism – particularly at local level – and a loss of public participation and trust in democracy. The watchdog role of the local press drives up standards in many other unexpected ways. In the US, congressmen in areas not covered by a local newspaper do less to represent their communities in the absence of local watchdogs – they are more likely to toe the party to line than rebel, and do less constituency work, while their areas get less federal funding. Where local newsrooms have had severe staff cuts, there’s also less competition in mayoral elections. There’s evidence from Norway and Japan that councils in areas with high local paper circulations are more efficient. The decline of local newspapers and reduced coverage of local politics has even been blamed for political polarisation, particularly in poorer areas. And it’s not just about politics. The Index on Censorship has reported on the problems of reduced local newsrooms trying to report accurately while public bodies, including health and education trusts, employ highly paid marketing teams to protect their image; and local social media groups share information that often turns out to be false. Fewer local journalists means less coverage of court cases and inquests. In my own research into coverage of coroners’ courts, we found evidence of “news deserts”: areas where inquests were never reported due to staff cuts and patchy information from courts. Editors told me it was increasingly difficult to contact the police directly, as contacts were funneled through police “newsrooms” – previously press offices – which now aim to prioritize good news stories about police successes. This has serious consequences. The importance of the reporting of public inquests has been highlighted by the work of George Julian, who live-tweets inquests of people with learning difficulties and autism. They typically die two decades earlier than people without these special needs, often because of poorly managed care which is only highlighted during the inquest process. But if there is no one there to cover the inquest, there is little public pressure for change. The moves by the Australian government are a step in the right direction but there is a risk that the negotiating system will let the big players grab the newly released revenue, leaving high-quality, professional local journalism high and dry again. This is actually in nobody’s interests. National news organisations have long relied on the local press to act as a grassroots army of reporters. Many national stories began as a local paper’s front page, and many great reporters started out on the local press. Self-interest actually should dictate that they use their power to help their smaller colleagues, but it seems likely that, without a keen oversight by the reviewing body a year from now, short-termism will ensure they continue to carve out the biggest slice of the pie. – The Conversation|Rappler.com Amy Binns is Senior Lecturer, Journalism and Digital Communication, University of Central Lancashire.

Not only is jumping rope a fun, affordable and portable form of exercise, it also has many benefits for our health and fitness. Here are just a few reason why jumping rope is such a good form of exercise: Jumping rope has long been used by boxers as a form of training to help improve their footwork and general conditioning. Jumping rope will cause an increase in heart rate and breathing similar to if you went jogging. If you were to do ten minutes of jump rope everyday, you would create adaptations to your body that are beneficial to cardiovascular health, such as lowering blood pressure and reducing resting heart rate. Jumping rope will also increase your cardiorespiratory fitness which essentially means your body becomes more efficient at taking up and using oxygen. Research has shown that cardiorespiratory fitness is linked to improved health and longevity. Improved cardiorespriatory fitness has been shown to reduce blood pressure, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation in the body and lower chances of developing diabetes and many other chronic disease. Skipping is a full body workout which uses your abdominal muscles to stabilise the body, your legs for jumping, and your shoulders and arms for turning the rope. It therefore provides an all over workout rather than just isolating one portion of the body. Full body workouts increase muscle tone, which will help with all daily activities, and increase our resting metabolism, which helps us burn calories even while resting. Skipping involves coordination to time your jump with the rope. Research has shown that it improves coordination, balance and basic movement skills in children. These are important fitness components for later in life as they reduce our chances of trips and falls. There are so many different exercises you can do with the rope and each one requires different coordination to complete the exercise. This may help exercise your brain as well. Jumping rope involves making impact with the ground with every jump. These impacts cause our bones to remodel themselves to become stronger, thus increasing bone density. Bone density can be a benefit later on in life, when it naturally begins to decrease. Research has shown that jumping rope increases bone mineral density. Higher bone mineral density makes you less likely to break a bone or develop osteoporosis as you get older. Hip fractures are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older people, leading to loss of independence and a huge economic burden. Improving bone density and balance throughout your life reduces the chances of trips and falls later on. Because jumping rope requires fast movement of the feet and arms, it’s considered a plyometric exercise. This is where the muscles exert maximum force in short intervals of time, with the goal of increasing power. Plyometric exercise is used in the sporting world to increase an athlete’s speed. A lot of exercises, such as jogging, only improve cardiovascular health – whereas jumping rope has the added benefit of improving speed as well. Daily jump rope practice may help you run quicker than before. Jumping rope offers many health benefits that may be achieved in a short period of time. Because it’s a full body exercise that requires speed and coordination, you could argue that it’s a form of high intensity interval training (HIIT). HIIT exercise is where you have short bouts of high intensity efforts followed by a short rest intervals. This is repeated several times. HIIT has been shown to produce higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in comparison to traditional endurance training. It’s also more time efficient, as you can perform exercise over a shorter period. This is why HIIT training has become the most popular workout worldwide. Jumping rope is easily adaptable, and can be a high-intensity workout depending on the effort and power a person puts into their training. One of the most important points we need to consider to help us change our exercise habits is that what we do needs to be enjoyable to us. One of the biggest barriers for people when it comes to sticking with exercise is enjoyment. And research shows enjoying exercise is critical for helping us change our exercise habits and continue exercising. The great thing about skipping is that there are so many different ways you can jump, and hop over the rope. You can create a varied workout which helps maintain your enjoyment. However, it’s worth noting that skipping can put a lot of force on our lower limbs when we land. Though this improves our bone mineral density, it can lead to lower-body injury, especially if we’re not used to this force. But different jumping styles can be used to help ease force and reduce chance of injury. As with all types of exercise, it’s good to build up duration gradually. This will help minimise injury. Overall, jumping rope could be a very beneficial form of exercise. Not only does it improve many important aspects of our health – including cardiovascular health, and improving bone density – but it’s also affordable, portable and doesn’t require much space. – The Conversation/Rappler.com  Dr Lindsay Bottoms is a Reader in Exercise and Health Physiology at the University of Hertfordshire.

It’s proof, if any were needed, of the extent to which the country’s military leaders are willing to subvert the COVID crisis to their own ends. The new charge carries a maximum three-year prison sentence. But an amendment to Myanmar’s penal code instituted by the junta on February 14 permits the army to detain people without having to go to court. Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested on February 1 along with other members of the NLD government which had been re-elected in a landslide in December. She was charged with possession of illegally imported walkie-talkies. But the decision to level this additional charge of breaching COVID restrictions is consistent with the way the military has used the pandemic to gain and cement power after the coup. This should alarm both democrats and public health officials the world over. Colleagues at the International State Crime Initiative, Neve Gordon and Penny Green, have described how some governments “exploited the COVID-19 crisis” to introduce policies such as increased surveillance and emergency security measures that “undermine democratic principles and violate the civil and political rights of both citizens and migrants”. You can hear more about the events which led up to Myanmar’s military coup in the second episode of our new podcast, The Conversation Weekly – the world explained by experts. Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts. A key justification for the coup presented by the military is the claim that last November’s national election was substantially unfair. The election was run amid rising COVID-19 infections throughout the country. Myanmar was extremely vulnerable to COVID-19, and was hit particularly badly – with one of south-east Asia’s highest death tolls. But in this health crisis, military supremo Min Aung Hlaing saw political opportunity. As the virus took hold and the election approached, it was clear that Aung Sun Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party was on track for another win. But Myanmar’s COVID-19 spike coincided with the start of the official campaign period, leading to restrictions on campaigning – an outcome regarded as giving an advantage to the incumbent government. Ongoing conflicts between the military and ethnic minority groups prevented the electoral commission in some parts of the country from undertaking elections – there were similar issues in 2015 and vacant seats were later filled at byelections. Aung San Suu Kyi rejected the military’s calls to postpone the election as likely to lead to a political crisis in a country where past elections have commonly been cancelled, manipulated or ignored. Weak institutional capacity, a hangover from decades of military rule, also contributed to making alternative voting methods such as mail-in balloting unfeasible for widespread use. As expected, Aung San Suu Kyi’s government was re-elected with a landslide, while the military’s proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), received less than one-tenth of the available seats (constitutionally, a quarter of the parliament’s seats are reserved for the armed forces so are not contested at elections). Admittedly, the military was not alone in expressing concern about conducting a general election amid the pandemic. Some ethnic minority parties and independents were concerned too. But they largely came to terms with the way the election commission conducted the poll and accepted its outcome. The military subsequently claimed widespread electoral fraud, often framing criticisms as concern for public safety. It argued the election should not have gone ahead during the pandemic and needed to be rerun right up until undertaking the coup. Once the decision to launch the coup was taken, the military again used COVID-19 to add a sheen of constitutionality to its power grab. Myanmar’s president, Win Myint, was arrested in a pre-dawn raid and accused of breaking COVID-19 rules during the election campaign. Since the February 1 coup, the pandemic has also been a regular feature of the generals’ proclamations. COVID-19 has featured prominently in state media in the days following the coup, including in Min Aung Hlaing’s “Notification No. 1” which included a pledge that was really a veiled warning: “Prevention of the current outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic will be effectively carried out with momentum.” On the face of it, during a pandemic, this appears to be a sensible way to proceed. But in post-coup Myanmar this underlines the junta’s intention to use anti-COVID measures to empower the military in preventing public gatherings and protests. The charges against Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior NLD figures are manifestations of the same cynical approach to the virus. Using COVID-19 as a justification for the arrest of civilian leaders and to limit public demonstrations undermines trust in government measures worldwide to tackle COVID-19. It effectively reframes these measures as potentially sinister tools to increase government control, rather than as necessary public health controls. In doing so, Myanmar’s military has not only damaged the country’s progress towards democracy, but also arguably undermined global efforts to tackle the pandemic. – The Conversation|Rappler.com Ronan Lee is an Irish-Australian Visiting Scholar at  Queen Mary University of London‘s School of Law and the International State Crime Initiative.

HSBC said the new private bank, which is in one of the most promising wealth markets in Asia, will help it provide clients with access to international capital markets by leveraging its existing infrastructure of advisory and investment methodologies in Asia. “In Thailand and across ASEAN, private wealth is often created and built through business growth and expansion and as intra-regional trade and activity rebound, we expect commercial, people, and wealth flows to increase,” said Philip Kunz, HSBC’s head of global private banking for Southeast Asia. Last year, HSBC combined its global private banking and retail wealth businesses to create a new unit that manages more than $1.4 trillion in clients’ assets, with half coming from Asia. The team in Thailand will cover client management and advisory services while clients’ assets will be booked in HSBC Private Banking in Singapore, a regional wealth management hub.

The 5-year senior secured loan was upsized from the initial $750 million after the company secured commitments from international institutional investors, Singapore-based Grab said in a statement on Monday, February 1. Anthony Tan, group chief executive officer and co-founder of Grab, said that investors recognized the value of Grab’s super app platform, as “we continue making consistent progress in achieving our growth and sustainability milestones.” Backed by investors including Softbank Group Corporation, Grab has evolved from a ride-hailing app operator to a one-stop shop for services such as food delivery, payments, and insurance in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people. Ranked as Southeast Asia’s most valuable startup with a valuation of more than $16 billion, Grab recently won a digital bank license in Singapore. Last month, Grab said its total group net revenue jumped by about 70% year-on-year in 2020 and recovered to comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. The loan will be used for general corporate purposes and will allow Grab to diversify its finances. Grab said the interest rate on the loan was lowered by 100 basis points from the original launch guidance to 450 basis points over LIBOR. Grab’s food business, which has benefited from a sector-wide boom in food delivery as countries imposed lockdowns, accounts for more than 50% of its revenue. Grab expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of 2021. JPMorgan was the lead bookrunner on the loan facility, while Barclays, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Mizuho, MUFG, and Standard Chartered were the joint bookrunners. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-considering-united-states-initial-public-offering-2021/","title":"Southeast Asia’s Grab considering US IPO this year, sources say","date":"Jan 18, 2021 8:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab's initial public offering plans have not been finalized and are subject to market conditions, sources tell Reuters","body":"Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery giant Grab is exploring a listing in the United States this year, encouraged by robust investor appetite for initial public offerings (IPOs), 3 sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Grab’s IPO could raise at least $2 billion, one of the sources said, which would likely make it the largest overseas share offering by a Southeast Asian company. “The market is good and the business is doing better than before. This should work well for public markets,” he said. The plans, including the size of the issue and timing, have not been finalized and are subject to market conditions, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the matter. Singapore-based Grab declined comment on the potential IPO. Grab, whose backers include SoftBank Group Corporation and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, has expanded rapidly from its beginnings as a ride-hailing venture in Malaysia in 2012 to become the region’s most valuable startup worth more than $16 billion. The company has raised more than $10 billion as it becomes a one-stop shop for services such as food delivery, payments, and insurance in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people. It recently gained a digital bank license in Singapore. Grab’s total group net revenue jumped by about 70% year on year in 2020 and has recovered to be comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. Moody’s said this month Grab had cash holdings of about $3.2 billion, which the ratings agency “expects will be sufficient to cover negative operating cash flow, capital spending at its transport and food delivery businesses, and scheduled debt maturities over at least the next 2 to 3 years.” One of the sources said he expects Grab’s IPO to raise substantially more than $2 billion as some of its long-term investors trim stakes and new investors come on board. Grab has said its ride-hailing business is breaking even in all its operating markets, including Indonesia, the biggest. It expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of 2021. The IPO plans would come after merger discussions with Indonesian rival Gojek were derailed. Gojek and Indonesian e-commerce leader Tokopedia are in advanced talks for an $18-billion merger ahead of a potential dual listing in Jakarta and the United States, Reuters reported this month. As consumers increasingly adopt online services amid lockdowns to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, investors are paying more focus on market leaders. Grab caught global attention when Uber sold its Southeast Asia business to the company in 2018 after a costly 5-year battle and in return took a stake in Grab. It now operates in 397 cities across 8 Southeast Asian countries and its app has seen 214 million downloads. Grab’s food delivery business overtook the mature transport division to become the company’s biggest segment last year. “It’s quite clear that investors are rewarding growth and market share,” said the second source, pointing to a 15-fold surge in shares of Singapore-based e-commerce, gaming, and payments firm Sea since its 2017 listing in New York. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/wonder-woman-1984-box-office-earnings-january-2021/","title":"‘Wonder Woman 1984’ grabs $5.5M in US, global total tops $118M","date":"Jan 4, 2021 11:53 AM PHT","snippet":"WarnerMedia has issued some vague numbers touting 'Wonder Woman 1984's' popularity on HBO Max, but little in the way of hard data","body":"Wonder Woman 1984 used its lasso of truth to rope in $5.5 million over the New Year’s holiday. The sequel also ensnared another $10.1 million from overseas markets, bringing its global total to $118.5 million. That’s not a disastrous figure given how much coronavirus has upended the movie business, but it does represent a steep 67% drop domestically and is a far cry from the grosses of pre-pandemic blockbusters. Stateside, Wonder Woman 1984 has earned $28.5 million. The superhero sequel, which is currently getting some social media backlash for not rising to the level of its beloved predecessor, is being simultaneously released on HBO Max in a bid to bolster the WarnerMedia streaming service and as a concession to a global health crisis that’s left the theatrical distribution landscape severely diminished. The company has issued some vague numbers touting Wonder Woman 1984’s popularity on HBO Max, but little in the way of hard data.  It did announce that Gal Gadot and director Patty Jenkins will reunite for a third film in the franchise, a sign that it believes the Amazonian warrior is a vital part of its plans for growing its DC cinematic universe. Beyond Wonder Woman 1984, Universal and Dreamworks Animation’s The Croods: A New Age pulled in $2.2 million in its sixth week of release. That pushes the animated sequel’s domestic haul to $34.5 million and its global total to just under $115 million. The film is being released due to a pact between the studio and major exhibitors such as AMC and Cinemark by which the movies can get released premium video on-demand with two weeks of their theatrical debuts. In return, struggling theater chains get a cut of the digital revenues.  Universal also released News of the World, a western that reunites Tom Hanks with his Captain Philips director Paul Greengrass. The film grossed $1.7 million, pushing its domestic total to $5.4 million. Netflix bought the international rights to the movie this winter. Hanks stars as a Civil War vet who must return a young girl who was captured by natives to her remaining family. Lionsgate’s Fatale, a psychological thriller with Hilary Swank and Michael Ealy, grossed $700,000 in its third weekend of release. That brings its total to $3.1 million. Focus’ Promising Young Woman, which like News of the World and The Croods sequel is part of its parent studio Universal’s deal with exhibitors, picked up $660,000 in its second weekend. Its domestic total now stands at $1.9 million. Promising Young Woman has scored a great deal of buzz for its provocative look at sexual violence and revenge and has earned awards chatter for star Carey Mulligan’s performance. Disney and Pixar’s Soul has been streaming on Disney Plus over the holidays, but it has been made available in theaters in overseas markets such as China, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand. The animated story of a middle school music teacher whose soul gets separated from his body grossed $16.5 million in its second weekend of release. That pushes its total to $32.5 million. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/analysis-asia-winners-losers-2020-female-duo-shows-the-way/","title":"[ANALYSIS] Asia’s winners and losers in 2020: Dynamic female duo shows the way","date":"Dec 28, 2020 8:53 AM PHT","snippet":"In this most difficult of years, Best Year in Asia goes to a dynamic duo of decisive female leaders who are showing the way to a better year ahead","body":"From K-pop sensation BTS to the people of Hong Kong in 2019, Asia’s “winners” and “losers” in our annual rankings from “Best Year” to “Worst Year” have at times caught the eye of Malacañang and the Office of the President.  This was particularly true in 2016, when CNN picked up our naming the then-newly elected President Rodrigo Duterte as having had the Best Year in Asia. In 2018, Fox News took note when we gave “Press Freedom in Asia” the dubious distinction of Bad Year in Asia, citing attacks on the media in Myanmar, the Philippines and elsewhere. Now, as 2021 thankfully begins, we take one last look at the year that was. For the Philippines and Southeast Asia, 2020 was a year that could not be over fast enough. As of December 26, COVID-19 cases reached 469,005 in the Philippines, with the death toll surpassing 9,000. Both numbers were second only to those for Indonesia among all ASEAN nations. Metro Manila alone accounted for some 206,000 cases and 3,760 deaths by Christmas. Elsewhere, the ongoing economic and health catastrophe has encompassed more than 1.7 million dead globally – including more than 325,000 in the United States and more than 147,000 in India.   Yet, less than 12 months since the novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov2, first identified in China would spread with deadly effect to the world, there lies hope for a better year ahead amidst unprecedented progress on vaccines and treatments.  So, who was up and who was down in Asia in 2020? Here’s our annual assessment:  As in too many places, it is the poorest and most vulnerable in Asia that have been hit hardest by COVID-19. The World Bank reports that Asia’s most vulnerable have borne the brunt of a “triple shock” – the pandemic itself, the economic fallout from the containment measures, and the ensuing global recession.  Amid collapsing tourism and weakened exports, hunger grows, and access to jobs, technology and education shrinks.  Across the Indo-Pacific, migrant workers in particular have suffered the consequences of economic lockdowns. The diversity of victims of the coronavirus’s economic impact has ranged from workers from Myanmar toiling in the Thai seafood industry, to manufacturing workers from Nepal at Malaysian medical glove factories. Overseas Filipino Workers, including many providing heroic, frontline health and other services, are being disproportionately impacted. The Asian Development Bank now projects that the coronavirus could push 160 million more into poverty across Asia.  The region’s poverty rate will increase for the first time in 20 years, adds the World Bank.  Sadly, it is Asia’s rapidly growing class of the “new COVID poor” who receive the depressing distinction of the worst year in Asia.  It should have been a year for the WHO to shine. Instead, the specialized UN health agency and its beleaguered director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia, found themselves in a no-win situation facing accusations of not holding China accountable for its less than transparent handling of the coronavirus.  Hidebound by the rules of bureaucracy and diplomacy, the WHO could say little as China delayed release of information, allowed millions to travel from Wuhan during the Chinese New Year period, and cracked down on citizen journalists and whistleblowers. In February, Chinese doctor Li Wenliang himself died from COVID-19 after seeking to warn others of a mysterious SARS-like virus early on.  Outgoing President Donald Trump said the US – the WHO’s largest donor – would leave the organization, alleging that Ghebreyesus and the WHO were beholden to China. A turnaround could be at hand with a new US administration, but it’s been a decidedly bad year for WHO and Ghebreyesus.   China President Xi Jinping’s successes at home so far in crushing COVID-19 and dissent in Hong Kong were tempered by the growing pushback abroad in 2020 against his much touted “Belt and Road Initiative.”   This grand “One Belt One Road” infrastructure scheme launched in 2013 to connect some 70 countries with a “new Silk Road” of Chinese-financed ports, railways and highways, and other projects ran into growing push back amid COVID-19 slowdowns and worries about debt owed to China. This was underscored at year-end as Australia approved new laws that would give Prime Minister Scott Morrison powers to veto or scrap agreements that state governments reach with foreign countries, including a BRI project in the state of Victoria. Many in the Philippines are likewise giving second thoughts to the strings that might be attached to China’s involvement in the Philippines’ “build build build” initiatives. A 2020 Pew Research survey fielded in 14 countries including Australia, the US and several Asian and European nations revealed that attitudes toward Xi and China have now reached new lows. At least 78% of respondents stated that they had little or no confidence Xi would do the right thing in global affairs, up from 61% in 2019. 2020 was a decidedly mixed year for Xi despite, or perhaps because of, the reality of China’s engagement abroad – from conflict on the Himalayan border with India to trade tensions and disputes over the Mekong River and the West Philippine Sea.  The United States might have Amazon and eBay, and Philippine consumers know Lazada, Shopee and Zalora, but a diversity of Asia’s e-commerce giants also found 2020 to be an emphatically good year.  E-commerce in Asia was already on the rise well before COVID-19. GoJek of Indonesia and Grab of Singapore have long had well established digital payment platforms. And with the pandemic, the pace of adoption has quickened as lockdowns drove more consumers online, from India to Japan.   Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com racked up a record $115 billion in sales on a single day. And a report from Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Company projects e-commerce in Southeast Asia to exceed $100 billion by 2025, up from $38 billion in 2019.  All this is good news across Asia for e-commerce platforms such as Tokopedia, Taobao, Shopify, Bukalapak, and Sendo. Importantly, 2020 might also herald many a good year ahead as consumers build on new digital habits, from fintech to telemedicine.  Both women won landslide reelection this year, but that’s not all that Taiwan President Tsai-Ing Wen and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have in common. These two leaders led charges against COVID-19, instituting strict lockdown measures that prevented community transmission in their countries while also avoiding the draconian practices adopted by China.  In late December, Taiwan, with a population of about 24 million, had reported just 776 cases and seven deaths. New Zealand, with a population of about 5 million, had recorded about 2125 cases and 25 deaths. Arden has also remained unruffled during a live telecast in the midst of an earthquake, and continues to lead her nation forward amid enduring climate change and terrorism worries.  And when it comes to economic numbers, Tsai and the people and businesses of Taiwan may well be a role model for all. A campaign proclaiming “Taiwan can help” has sought to turn the island’s success in battling COVID-19 into geopolitical gains. By mid-December, Taiwan’s 2020 economic growth looked to outpace much of Asia’s including that of mainland China the world’s second largest economy – for the first time in decades.   So, in this most difficult of years, Best Year in Asia goes to a dynamic duo of decisive female leaders who are showing the way to a better year ahead. – Rappler.com  Curtis S.

Does this pose a threat to poorer countries in Asia?","body":"The dominance of any country or individuals in funding the COVID-19 vaccine may pose a threat for developing countries in Asia, medical experts have warned. The world’s wealthiest nations and organizations are spending $3.3 billion in COVID-19-related research, with the United States financing 41% of the total amount, revealed a recent study. Conducted by Research Investments in Global Health (RESIN) of the University of Southampton, the study found that as of October, 75% of the global funding has been allocated to vaccine development ($2.475 billion). The US government has contributed $955 million.  The remaining $395 million comes mostly from grant awards from the US medical research center National Institutes of Health, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Leaders of the 20 biggest economies have vowed to spare no effort to supply COVID-19 drugs, tests, and vaccines affordably and fairly to “all people.” Drugmakers Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca announced the efficacy of their vaccine candidates in November.  Dependence on others for vaccine supply comes with risks. Renzo Guinto, chief medical doctor and founder of Filipino nongovernmental health and environment organization PH Lab, said recipient countries that rely on wealthier nations or groups may become “beholden to donors.” “In these times of crisis, any help is welcome, but safeguards will need to be put in place so that donors, whether governments or philanthropy, truly support health system strengthening and the achievement of national health goals,” Guinto told Eco-Business. He added that although there are intergovernmental norms to ensure that recipient countries can decide on how funds will be spent and which issues to prioritize, these mostly apply to high-income country donors, not philanthropy, which he said makes “foundations such as Gates’ really influential.” The RESIN study showed that after the US, the second biggest funder of COVID-19-research was the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global network of philanthropic and civil society organizations that develops vaccines to stop epidemics. It has received donations worth $1.1 billion from national, charitable, and private investments, including the Gates Foundation. CEPI, together with the World Health Organization (WHO) and Switzerland-based vaccine alliance GAVI, has launched Covax, a global vaccine allocation plan that pools funds from wealthier countries and nonprofits to buy and distribute future vaccines to poorer countries. In Asia, lower- to middle-income countries like Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Vietnam are among those that will be supported by Covax. “More money coming from Gates given to WHO or CEPI, which backs Covax, means that [the foundation] will continue to have a very strong say regarding important decisions shaping health policy priorities, like how and where investments will be allocated, not just for COVID-19 but in other aspects of global health,” said Guinto.  Eco-Business has contacted the Gates Foundation for comment.  Kevin Baird, director of the Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, which conducts studies on infectious diseases in Indonesia, echoed the downside of wealthy countries like the US funding the bulk of research and development as well as securing advance orders of the vaccine. “The US government stepped into that ecosystem – of academic researchers partnered with pharma entities – with massive funding aimed almost wholly at mitigating the risks being taken by the pharma partners,” Baird told Eco-Business. “There is, naturally, quid pro quo: US will be first in line for vaccines it helped finance, which spawns inequity of access.” Baird, who specializes in malaria studies, also said he feared neglect of developing Asian nations by the US-funded global health players as they tend “to be very much Afro-centric in outlook, strategy, and action.”  “Investments made by WHO, Gates and Gavi in malaria, for example, are nearly insignificant in Asia. The same biases may see neglect of the Asian nations in need of direct aid on COVID-19 vaccines access,” he said.  However, the veteran microbiologist noted how the Gates Foundation engages academics to develop vaccine technologies with “key strings attached aimed at preventing inequity,” such as demanding agreements regarding open access to data and findings, which makes profiteering on intellectual property difficult.  He said, “If anything, the Gates Foundation engagement on this problem mitigates the risk of inequity.” Gates-funded studies were previously accused by Aarata Kochi, WHO’s head of malaria research, of adopting “a uniform framework approved by the Foundation,” leading to homogeneity of thinking, and discouraging independent reviews of research proposals. In a memorandum written in 2008, Kochi said that the foundation’s money, while crucial, could have “far-reaching, largely unintended consequences.” Ian Gonzales, who heads the infectious diseases cluster at the Department of Health in Northern Mindanao in the Philippines, disagreed that there is any downside to countries like the US or individuals like Bill Gates being heavily invested in COVID-19-related funding. In fact, he said having them involved “will surely accelerate the process” of developing a viable vaccine. “The concerns that we do have once a vaccine is available is the accessibility for lower- and middle-income countries such as the Philippines. Fortunately, this has been anticipated and the Covax facility will accelerate vaccine development while ensuring equitable access for all countries,” Gonzales told Eco-Business.  Through the Covax facility, nearly two billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines will be shipped and flown next year to over 92 developing countries, including those in Asia, in a “mammoth operation,” the UN children’s agency UNICEF said. “We are mapping out commercial routes and looking into the possibility of charter flights to countries in Asia, if needed, as a result of commercial capacity limitations. UNICEF will continue to assess transport capacity needs going forward to ensure we can deliver vaccines in a quick and efficient manner,” UNICEF told Eco-Business.  The WHO reiterated that it launched Covax specifically to guard against so-called “vaccine nationalism,” which is marked by wealthy countries hoarding COVID-19 vaccines, its Philippine country office said. “WHO is working with its vaccine pillar Covax to speed up the development and manufacturing of a safe and effective vaccine and ensure that there is fair and equitable access to these vaccines for all countries, with an aim of ending the acute phase of the pandemic in 2021,” it said.  However, Geneva-based medical nongovernmental organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) urged the UN’s health agency to open up intellectual property, including patents, so that medical products can be more easily accessed, especially by low-income countries. “Instead of having enforceable mechanisms, WHO, member states and the implementing institutions continue to rely on voluntary contributions of the pharmaceutical industry, which refuses to offer non-exclusive licenses with worldwide coverage to facilitate global access,” MSF said in a statement in October. “Instead, we have witnessed the ‘business-as-usual’ practice of pharmaceutical corporations pursuing secretive and monopolistic business agreements, perpetuating inequalities and inequities in access.” It also noted how wealthy nations like the US and European Union states have already forged multibillion-dollar supply deals with drugmakers and purchased 3.8 billion doses of potential coronavirus vaccines, leaving less available for poor nations.  This is not the first time that wealthy countries have grabbed the lion’s share of vaccines and other drugs needed to fight a pandemic. In 2005, doctors from Asia called out nations like the US and UK for stockpiling antivirals which were developed to counter the H5N1 influenza or bird flu pandemic. – Rappler.com This story was originally published on Eco-Business and republished with permission."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/gilas-pilipinas/games-results-thailand-philippines-fiba-asia-cup-qualifiers-november-30-2020/","title":"Gilas Pilipinas sweeps Thailand to grab lead in FIBA qualifiers","date":"Nov 30, 2020 10:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Brothers Javi and Juan Gomez de Liaño show the way as Gilas Pilipinas reasserts its mastery over Thailand","body":"Gilas Pilipinas issued another blowout win after thwarting Thailand, 93-69, to sweep the second window of the FIBA Asia Cup 2021 Qualifiers in Manama, Bahrain on Monday, November 30. Brothers Javi and Juan Gomez de Liaño linked up for 33 points as the Philippines reasserted its mastery over Thailand to grab the solo lead in Group A with a 3-0 record.  Javi Gomez de Liaño turned out to be a model of efficiency after finishing with 19 points on a 7-of-8 shooting from the field, while Juan Gomez de Liaño scattered 14 points, 4 rebounds, and 4 assists.  Thailand gained momentum after cutting its deficit to 14 points, 50-64, in the third quarter before the Gomez de Liaños combined for 7 points in an 11-2 run the Philippines erected for a 75-52 lead going into the last frame.  All of Gilas Pilipinas’ wins have been lopsided so far after it crushed Indonesia by 30 points in the first window and annihilated Thailand by 32 points in their first encounter.  “The lead we had in the first game was big. We were concerned that we might take this game for granted,” said Philippines head coach Jong Uichico. “We really harped on executing the offense and defense.”  Dwight Ramos churned out 13 points and 5 rebounds, while Matt Nieto chalked up 12 points and 2 assists before leaving the court in the third quarter due to a sprained ankle.  Not making the cut in the first game against Thailand, Calvin Oftana impressed in his Gilas Pilipinas debut with 9 points – all coming in the second period – on top of 4 rebounds, 4 assists, and 1 steal. Isaac Go and Justine Baltazar formed a formidable frontline in the win and combined for 11 points, 21 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 steals.  Chanatip Jakrawan did most of the heavy lifting for Thailand with 34 points, 12 rebounds, and 2 steals, but his monster game proved not enough for his team to clinch its first win. Thailand remained at last place in Group A with a 0-4 card, going winless in 3 games in the second window.

Aaron Black did not shy away from the spotlight in his first PBA playoff game as he came up big in a 78-71 win Meralco pulled off against San Miguel to stay alive in the Philippine Cup quarterfinals. The No. 18 overall pick unloaded 11 of his 14 points in the final quarter, none bigger than his three-pointer with two minutes remaining that kept San Miguel at bay.  Off a kick out pass from Chris Newsome, Black buried his third triple of the period from the left corner for a 76-67 lead as Meralco forced a rubber match against the twice-to-beat San Miguel.  “Like I’ve always said, Aaron has a lot of improvement ahead of him. He really has to work on his game, but he does have confidence,” Meralco head coach Norman Black said about his son.  “Sometimes too much, but he does have confidence to shoot the basketball,” the older Black said in jest.  The younger Black said the win is a major morale boost, especially since Meralco proved San Miguel, the winner of the last 5 All-Filipino crowns, is still vulnerable. If anything, now is the best time for teams to dethrone San Miguel, which is missing reigning six-time MVP June Mar Fajardo and star Terrence Romeo.  “It is a confidence booster for us,” Black said. “I think they won the last 5 championships so they’re a tough team.”  The former Ateneo Blue Eagle, though, knows the job is far from over, knowing San Miguel has the championship pedigree to bounce back.   “We just said this is only halftime.

The 25-year-old Davis surprised Santa Cruz with a left uppercut that snapped the champion’s head back and sent him crumbling to the canvas late in the sixth round at the Alamodome Arena. Hit by a punch he never saw coming, Santa Cruz landed flat on his back under the padding in the ring corner and remained that way for about a minute while doctors attended to him. He was eventually able to sit up and was even smiling once he shook off the cobwebs. American Davis improved to 24-0 with 23 knockouts by registering the defining win of his up-and-coming career and handed the four-division champion Santa Cruz his first knockout. “I’m going to continue to show people all over the world that I’m the best. I don’t have to call anybody else out. I’m the top dog. Just line them up, and I’ll knock them out one by one,” said Davis. The 32-year-old Santa Cruz of Mexico dropped to 37-2-1 with 19 KOs. He was trying to win a title fight in his fifth weight class. Despite the coronavirus pandemic in the US, organizers allowed about 10,000 spectators into the arena with masks and social distancing rules in place. The fight pitted the knockout power of Davis against the endurance and dominating pressure style of Santa Cruz, but the latter never got the chance to wear Davis down in the closing rounds. The fight began with a solid first round in which the two exchanged punches at the center of the ring. Davis fell to the canvas but it was not because of a knockdown. His right leg got tangled up with Santa Cruz’s leg and he tripped.  Santa Cruz also suffered a small cut on the bridge of his nose in the opening round but his corner did a good job of repairing it. In the second round, Davis’ temper got the best of him after he got frustrated during a clinch. Davis used both arms to throw Santa Cruz to the ground prompting a verbal scolding from the referee. Santa Cruz was looking more comfortable in the sixth and willing to exchange with Davis. But he got careless late in the round and that was all Davis needed to counter a punch and land the brutal shot that put the champion down. “There was nowhere he could have went. The rope was right there,” Davis said. Davis’ manager, Floyd Mayweather, said Davis can now pick and choose his opponents. “Tank is the top dog,” Mayweather said. “I’m putting him in position to do what I did. Fight who he wants, when we want. He’s the top dog.” Davis extended his six-year knockout streak to 15 straight bouts. He has a 96 percent knockout ratio. He vacated the WBA super featherweight crown to move up to the lightweight ranks last December, stopping Cuban Yuriorkis Gamboa in the 12th round. Santa Cruz, who was taken to the hospital for a checkup, captured his WBA title last November with a unanimous decision victory over American Miguel Flores. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-cashless-payments-feature/","title":"Grab shifts to cashless payments with new feature","date":"Oct 28, 2020 2:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines is also open to venturing into the motorcycle taxi business again 'if given a chance'","body":"Grab Philippines on Wednesday, October 28, announced that it has started rolling out a new feature to strengthen its adoption of cashless payments.

Previously, users could only top up with select drivers. Now, the update will fully integrate the feature into the platform. All users will have the update by mid-November, according to Grab. The move is seen to minimize cash transactions – a requirement set by transport regulators given the pandemic. Under the initial run, users will be able to top up with their drivers in the following services: Grab Philippines head of transport and shared services Ronald Roda said the feature will be expanded to other services in the coming months. Users who have yet to set up the ride-hailing firm’s virtual wallet GrabPay will be asked to do so. The national government’s coronavirus task force recently allowed motorcycle taxis to resume operations, pending guidelines from transport agencies. Asked whether Grab would consider venturing into the service again, Roda answered that they could “if given a chance.” “I think it would be easy [to return]. We have 70,000 two-wheel drivers which would make it easy for us to convert if needed,” he added. In mid-2016, Grab used to offer motorcycle hailing services, but this was discontinued as the antiquated law banned two-wheelers from being hired. In 2019, Angkas motorcycle drivers were allowed to offer rides under the Department of Transportation-led pilot study.

Users have harshly criticized the company for this move and will have to purchase these accessories separately, if needed. While some see it as cost-cutting, or a way for Apple to profit further by forcing customers to buy the products separately, the technology giant said the goal was to reduce its carbon footprint. This is the first time a major smartphone manufacturer has released a mobile without a charger. Earlier this year, reports emerged of Samsung considering a similar move, but it has yet to follow through. But even if abandoning chargers is a way for Apple to save money, the action could have a significant, positive impact on the environment. Australians, on average, buy a new mobile phone every 18-24 months. In Australia, there are about 23 million phones sitting unused – and therefore likely a similar number of accompanying chargers. Just as single-use shopping bags contribute to plastic waste, unused and discarded electronic appliances contribute to electronic waste (e-waste). Just over a decade ago, Australia started to ban single-use plastic bags, starting with South Australia. Today, every state and territory in Australia has enforced the ban except New South Wales – which intends to do so by the end of 2021. Since South Australia implemented its ban in 2008, state government estimates suggest it has avoided 8,000 kg of marine litter each year – and abated more than 4,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The benefits for the environment have been clear. So, why are we so hesitant to do the same for e-waste? E-waste includes different forms of discarded electric and electronic appliances that are no longer of value to their owners. This can include mobile phones, televisions, computers, chargers, keyboards, printers and earphones. Currently there are about 4.78 billion mobile phone users globally (61.2% of the world’s population). And mobile phone chargers alone generate more than 51,000 tonnes of e-waste per year. On this basis, the environment would greatly benefit if more users reused phone chargers and if tech companies encouraged a shift to standardized charging that works across different mobile phone brands. This would eventually lead to a reduction in the manufacturing of chargers and, potentially, less exploitation of natural resources. Citing an increase in e-waste and consumer frustration with multiple chargers, the European Parliament has been pushing for standardized chargers for mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers, smart cameras, wearable electronics and other small or medium-sized electronic devices. This would negate the need for users to buy different chargers for various devices. Of course, there’s no doubt phone companies want people to regularly buy new phones. Apple themselves have been accused of building a feature into phones that slows them down as they get older. Apple responded by saying this was simply to keep devices running as their batteries became worn down. But even if this is the case, Apple’s decision to ship phones without chargers would still reduce the use of precious materials. A smaller product box would let Apple fit up to 70% more products onto shipping pallets – reducing carbon emissions from shipping. However, it remains to be seen exactly how much this would assist in Apple’s environmental goals, especially if many consumers end up buying a charger separately anyway. Apple equates its recent “climate conscious” changes to the iPhone 12 with removing 450,000 cars from the road annually. The company has a target of becoming carbon-neutral by 2030. It’s worth considering whether Apple’s main incentive is simply to cut costs, or perhaps push people towards its own wireless charging devices. These concerns are not without merit. Apple is one of the richest companies in the world, with most of its market capital made with hardware sales. Without a shift to a standardized plug-in charger, a wireless charging boom could be an environmental disaster (even though it’s perhaps inevitable due to its convenience). Wireless charging consumes around 47% more power than a regular cable. This may be a concern, as the sustainability advantages of not including a charger could come alongside increased energy consumption. Currently, the Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) sector is responsible for about 2% of the world’s energy consumption. Perhaps one solution to the dilemma is device trade-in services, which many companies already offer, including Apple and Samsung. Apple gives customers a discount on a new device if they trade in their older model, instead of throwing it out.

Vera Cruz takes over the ride-hailing giant effective Thursday. She was the managing director of Seawood Resources before joining Grab in October. Seawood is the parent company of Strong Oak, which had acquired shares in listed Alliance Select Foods International in 2014. Vera Cruz was a board member of the latter. Vera Cruz also worked with management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, investments firm CLSA Exchange Capital, and oil giant Shell. She acquired her undergraduate degree in business economics from the University of the Philippines. She pursued a masteral degree in business administration, focusing on finance, at the London Business School. Grab said Vera Cruz will focus on “creating deeper synergies” among its wide array of services. “I look forward to working with the team to leverage Grab’s technology and innovation to help Filipino communities safely and sustainably recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Vera Cruz.  Grab entered the Philippine market in 2013 as GrabTaxi – the first foreign destination for the Singapore-based start-up. Now, Grab operates in 18 Philippine cities for its ride-hailing, food and package delivery, and financial services, among others. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/grab-driver-arrested-assaulted-by-cop-taguig-october-2020/","title":"Female Grab driver arrested, assaulted by cop in Taguig","date":"Oct 7, 2020 7:13 PM PHT","snippet":"(4TH UPDATE) Grab driver Florence Norial is arrested and assaulted by a police officer after she asked him to move his car that blocked a mall driveway","body":"A female Grab driver was arrested and hit with a car door by a policeman in civilian clothes after she asked him to move his stalled vehicle blocking the driveway of a mall in Taguig City Tuesday evening, October 6. Grab driver Florence Norial, 26, was detained from around 7:40 pm on Tuesday evening up to as late as Wednesday afternoon after  she was accused of direct assault, alarm and scandal, and disobedience to authority from the encounter. This developed after Florence asked a driver to move his vehicle which was blocking the exit driveway of Grace Mall in Taguig City. At that time, she just picked up her Grab passenger from the mall. It turned out the driver of the vehicle blocking the passage was a certain Captain Ronald Saquilayan “Help pls! Nasa…police station po ako ngayon. Gusto po ako ikulong. Nag pick up ako pasahero sa Starbucks, ngayon kahit anong pakiusap ko s [pulis] na nasa harap ay ayaw umalis,”  Florence said in a Facebook status on Tuesday 8:41 pm, before she was detained. (Help please. I am at a police statioon now. They want to jail me. I picked up a passenger at Starbucks, and whatever pleaded  I made to ask the police to move, he still didn’t want to leave.) Mirza Miguel Shahzad – Florence’s boyfriend who spoke and stayed with her before she was locked away – denied the allegations of the police, providing an hour-by-hour account of the events to Rappler in an email.  Narrating Florence’s and his experience on Tuesday evening, Miguel said that the policeman was first to hit Florence. He said that Florence only acted on self-defense, and that the charges against her were fabricated, with the help of other personnel of the Taguig City Police. In a text message to Rappler, Taguig police chief Colonel Celso Rodriguez said Saquilayan was not assigned in their area, but was detailed with the Pateros police. He did not confirm whether they would launch a probe into the incident.  Meanwhile, Pateros police chief Colonel Ramchrisen Haveria Jr confirmed in a phone interview with Rappler, that Saquilayan was assigned with them.  Still,  Haveria said Taguig police should investigate the incident as it happened under their territorial responsibility. In a text message to Rappler, Grab Philippines spokesperson Nicka Hosaka said they were “already investigating the matter” and have “reached out to the family of the driver.” At around 7 pm on Tuesday evening, October 6, Florence was taking a passenger to the Starbucks branch in Grace Mall.  They stopped at the  driveway of the mall because a stalled dark grey Ford Ranger blocked the passage. Florence flashed her headlights and honked her horn, but the vehicle did not move. She walked over to the stalled vehicle and knocked on the driver’s door. Still, she was ignored. Florence asked the assistance of the guard nearby, and they knocked on the Ranger’s door once more.  This time the door swung open “suddenly and forcefully,” Miguel said, knocking Florence down to the bushes beside the driveway and injuring her. On impulse and in self-defense, Florence stood up and slapped the driver. The driver then said he was a police officer and arrested Florence.  The man who arrested Florence was wearing a printed black shirt and camouflage pants. He hastily arrested her without reading her rights. “He then forced her to the walls outside of Starbucks to cuff her as he asked his daughter (who was inside the Ford Ranger) to get his handcuffs inside the said vehicle,” Miguel said. In her last Facebook status before her arrest, Florence attached a video of her argument with the driver of the stalled vehicle. In the video, the man said “I am police Captain Ronald Saquilayan,” and said he was arresting Florence “for hurting me, for hitting me.”  Aside from the vague reason for the arrest, the police officer did not read her rights which is the standard protocol."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/football/preview-2020-english-premier-league/","title":"PREVIEW: Can Liverpool repeat or is the Premier League crown up for grabs?","date":"Sep 12, 2020 6:19 PM PHT","snippet":"Check out how the English Premier League teams stack up this 2020-2021 season","body":"Defending champion Liverpool continues to be the team to beat as the new Premier League season kicks off on Saturday, September 12.  Newly promoted Fulham takes on the up-and-coming Arsenal at the Craven Cottage for the season opening game at 7:30 pm, Philippine time. (READ: English Premier League games to air on Philippine TV) With renewed hopes and fresh expectations for each club, how will the league stack up this season?  There have been doubts on whether the Reds can repeat their incredible 19/20 season. The club’s form suffered a bit of a dip after it secured the league title. So far, Liverpool also hasn’t signed quality players to improve its squad depth. They have been linked with Bayern Munich’s Thiago, but nothing has materialized yet in that regard.  But with Virgil van Dijk, Sadio Mane, and Mohamed Salah leading the way, Liverpool displayed world-beating form when motivation struck. If it enters the 20/21 season with the same vigor that it did last season, the Reds will repeat as Premier League champions. City remains the most stacked team in the league, but based on last season, the club can be prone to mental lapses. It lost 9 games in the league including one to the relegated Norwich City.  Nonetheless, if Pep Guardiola’s squad shows the same motivation as in the 17/18 season, City should cruise to the Premier League based off talent alone.  Kevin de Bruyne is one of the world’s best players that will be leading the way for City. Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus upped their goal scoring, while Phil Foden emerged as one of the top young talents in the world. The Chelsea attack will be stacked next season thanks to Christian Pulisic’s arrival as a bonafide star and new signings Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech, and Timo Werner.  However, the Blues’ defense and goalkeeping remains a huge question mark and will ultimately prevent them from legitimately challenging for the title. If Chelsea manages to open the coffers once more to fortify the backline and replace the underwhelming Kepa in goal, it can manage to make the Premier League a three-horse race this season. Bruno Fernandes was godsend for the Red Devils last season. After acquiring Fernandes from Sporting in the January transfer window, United didn’t lose a single game in the league.  United also got 32 out of a possible 42 points, making a late charge for the third spot. A full season of Fernandes leading the attack alongside Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial – who scored a combined 34 goals in the league – will be a terrifying sight for opposing defenders. United must sign another defender to cement their spot in the top 4, but as it is, its attack is enough to carry them. In 2019, the Gunners suffered their worst Premier League season since 1995. However, under manager Mikel Arteta, the club is on the rise which culminated with a FA Cup trophy.  The presence of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored 22 goals last season in the league, will assure the Gunners’ attack while young defenders William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães and the emergence of the 19-year-old Bukayo Saka will give Arsenal fans hope for the future.  For now, without a new midfield signing, Arsenal is still a piece away from the top 4. Based on Jose Mourinho’s second-season stints with his former clubs, he either overachieved or delivered a trophy.  Will he do the same with the Spurs, who last lifted a trophy in the 2008 League Cup? Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min might be the most terrifying strike partnership in the league, but their midfield will be a question mark especially with Dele Alli’s struggles last season and club record signing Tanguy Ndombele’s fitness issues.  It’s fair to expect Spurs to finish 6th once again. The club is aging and it’s one Harry Kane injury away from dropping to mid-table. Everton had a successful transfer window, revamping its entire midfield with the acquisitions of Allan, Abdoulaye Doucouré, and James Rodríguez.  Rodríguez has worked with manager Carlo Ancelotti in Real Madrid, making it the ideal situation for the Colombian to revive his career as the Toffees’ primary creative outlet in the midfield. The partnership of Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin up top will be expected as the pair scored 13 goals apiece last season. There is also potential for improvement given the available boost from the midfield.  Everton might be a central defender away from solidifying its bid for a Europa League spot.  The loss of Matt Doherty to direct rivals Tottenham Hotspur is a huge loss for Wolves. Nonetheless, Wolves will still have one of the league’s best midfields in Joao Moutinho and Ruben Neves, while Diogo Jota and Raul Jimenez spearhead the attack. Adama Traore will continue to run wild in the Wolves’ right flank and his continued improvement will dictate how far they go this season – whether it be mid-table mediocrity or a spot in the Europa league after losing out this past season. The Foxes sat in second or third place for most of last season, but ended up finishing 5th place and missing a Champions League spot.  The loss of Ben Chilwell to Chelsea is a huge blow. But Jamie Vardy, last year’s Golden Boot winner with 23 goals, James Maddison, and Wilfred Ndidi remain. Manager Brendan Rodgers’ squad will still have enough quality to compete for European spot. Sheffield United was in contention for the Europa League spots for most of the year before it tailed off after the COVID-19 restart and finished 9th, which is considered successful first campaign back in the top flight. Chris Wilder was able to coach the Premiership’s fourth-most stifling defense but the lack of attacking punch will prove to be the Blades’ undoing yet again this upcoming season. Manager Ralph Hasenhüttl turned things around for the seemingly relegation-bound Saints last season with help from the star turn of Danny Ings, who scored 22 goals in the league. Ings’ rise as a proven goalscorer ensures that his club is comfortably mid-table with the potential to rise as a top-half team. Under manager Sean Dyche, Burnley has become a mid-table mainstay and unless they become absolutely ravaged by injuries, this season should prove to be more of the same After 16 years of toiling away from the first division of English football, Leeds is finally back in the Premiership. Leeds has the potential to be this year version of Sheffield United – a ragtag crew of hard-working players coached by one of the most brilliant minds in football in Marcelo Bielsa. Acquiring Callum Wilson was a necessary move to cover for Joelinton who had a nightmare of a season. The Brazilian, who acquired for €44.00 million, only scored two goals last season in the Premier League. Wilson, who scored 14 goals in the 18/19 Premier League season with Bournemouth, will complement wingers Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almiron perfectly in attack. The signing of Eberechi Eze from Queens Park Rangers and the acquisition of Michy Batshuayi on loan from Chelsea to flank Wilfried Zaha will supply Palace with a jolt of creativity and quality in attack. After posting the league’s second most-inept attack last season with only 31 goals, Palace’s solid acquisitions supplies it with just enough goals to supplement a solid, if uninspiring, defense. Graham Potter’s squad is made up of hard-working, gritty players as Brighton continues to look like one of the most physical teams in the Prem. The addition of experienced midfielder Adam Lallana and the continued emergence of last year’s additions Neil Maupay and Leandro Trossard will help clinch Brighton’s safety for the fourth straight season.  Villa will be in the middle of yet another relegation battle this season.  Nonetheless, it has the quality to stay up by the slimmest of margins with the addition of Ollie Watkins from Brentford and the expected signing of goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez from Arsenal. Jack Grealish remains with the club to pull the strings in midfield as Villa looks toward an extended run in the Premier League.  The controversy around the club’s sale of talented youngster Diangana could prove to be a disaster to the squad morale. Even captain Mark Noble voiced out his displeasure with the club after the sale of the 19-year-old Congolese winger.  Discontent with how the club is being run may lead to a slow start from which West Ham couldn’t recover. Bringing in an experienced keeper in the World Cup-winning Alphonse Areola was a shrewd move to secure the team in between the sticks.  However, the fate of this side will be no different from their 18/19 Premier League campaign unless manager Scott Parker somehow fortifies a defense that saw the club leak the most goals in its last season in the top flight. Bringing back Matheus Pereira on a permanent transfer and staging the transfer coup of Grady Diangana from West Ham were good moves from West Brom.  Pereira, in particular, notched 20 assists last season for the club and his creativity will be instrumental in its bid to stay in the Prem. However, coming straight from the second division, West Brom just hasn’t done enough in the market to bolster the squad to avoid relegation. – Jedd Pagaduan/Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-extends-ride-hailing-operating-hours/","title":"Grab extends ride-hailing operating hours","date":"Sep 2, 2020 1:30 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing giant extends the operating hours for GrabCar and GrabTaxi","body":"Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story said the operating hours were being shortened.

A revolutionary government is commonly associated with collapsing all branches of government and throwing out the Constitution to build a new a system as seen fit by the revolution’s leader. The Philippines has had two actual revolutionary governments so far: one under Emilio Aguinaldo, and another when dictator Ferdinand Marcos was ousted. (READ: LOOK BACK: When did the Philippines have a revolutionary government?) In almost every administration since Marcos, opposition groups have called for the ouster of their respective governments, but it was during former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s time that groups came up with concrete models of a revolutionary government. Under the Duterte administration, experts are confused by renewed calls for a revolutionary government as it is the President’s supporters who are calling for it – even as the revolution’s supposed “leader” Duterte is already the country’s incumbent leader. Duterte himself had threatened to declare one in 2017, and then retracted the threat. There were some calls again in 2018 and 2019. Duterte disowns the current calls, made by an organization that campaigned for him in 2016. Vice President Leni Robredo and several law enforcement officials have thumbed down the idea, too. What gave rise to calls for a revolutionary government in the past? Here’s a review of those. When former president Joseph “Erap” Estrada was ousted from office in 2001, the Supreme Court (SC) had to decide whether or not Arroyo’s presidency was constitutional. Estrada’s supporters called it a revolutionary government. The SC ultimately declared legal Arroyo’s government and the manner in which she was swept to office through People Power. Public sentiment toward the Arroyo government, however, changed overtime. Over 300 junior officers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) mounted the Oakwood mutiny in 2003. Lieutenant Senior Grade Antonio Trillanes IV of the Philippine Navy told reporters it was “not a coup d’etat, we are not attempting to grab power, we are just trying to express our grievances against this government.” In June 2005, the “Hello Garci” scandal erupted. Arroyo was accused of coordinating with then-elections commissioner Virgilio Garcillano to tamper with the 2004 election results. This was when talks of a revolutionary government really took off. There were around 10 oust-Arroyo camps that supported a third EDSA-type uprising, which would lead to the setting up of a “revolutionary council,” where civilians would be the dominant members. Retired army general Fortunato Abat and television evangelist Eddie Villanueva were some of the individuals who came up with models of a revolutionary government, should the country succeed in ousting Arroyo. Abat’s version would have a revolutionary council, headed by a commander-in-chief chosen by the military and police. The council would focus on maintaining peace and order. There would also be a revolutionary government headed by a chief executive officer to be chosen by civil society groups. The CEO would focus on instituting reforms. Under this revolutionary government, citizens’ concerns would be grouped into security, governance, and political sectors – each with a body that would report to the transitional government council. This model was essentially a military junta with a government program that would curtail some basic human rights, like the right to strike. It was supported by a Program for National Salvation espousing “authoritative governance.” It entailed drafting a new constitution as well. Villanueva’s model of a revolutionary government would have been established through a “bloodless revolution” backed by the military and the police as “protectors of the people.” The people in power would focus on putting “corrupt officials” in jail and establishing “authentic democracy.” Even then-San Juan mayor Jose Victor Ejercito, son of the ousted president Estrada, backed proposals for a possible revolutionary government after Arroyo. Ejercito proposed that there would be a council with 9 to 15 members who would represent major sectors: business, workers, farmers, youth, and political parties. Ejercito told reporters that his father should be part of the council because he still enjoyed popular support. He suggested other opposition leaders, like Senator Panfilo Lacson and Villanueva, be included in the council. For a time, former Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin was also considered to become part of the revolutionary council, regardless of which model would be adopted. Sin, however, died on June 21, 2005, within the same month the scandal emerged and before the oust-Arroyo rallies intensified. On July 8, 2005, 10 appointed government officials known as the “Hyatt 10” resigned from their posts to signal their withdrawal of support for Arroyo. In 2007, Arroyo faced another ouster plot when members of the military occupied the Manila Peninsula hotel in Makati. Led by Trillanes and Brigadier General Danilo Lim, the soldiers held a press conference calling on Arroyo to step down. This time, they were clear in their demand for a takeover. “We make this faithful step of removing Mrs Macapagal Arroyo from the presidency, and undertake the formation of a new government,” said Lim. Trillanes, Lim, and some officers eventually surrendered to end the 6-hour siege, while others fled from authorities. Arroyo was able to finish her term. Some individuals, and even President Duterte himself, have been behind several – actually yearly – calls for a revolutionary government since 2017. In August 2017, Duterte said it would take a revolutionary government for the Philippines to “really go up,” but it wouldn’t happen in his watch. Two months later on October 13, the President took a step back and warned that he would declare one once he sensed that a destabilization plot was afoot to replace him. Duterte supporters rallied in Mendiola on November 30, 2017, in support of a revolutionary government. They demanded the following: The demonstrators “granted” Duterte the powers to declare a revolutionary government to be able to rewrite the Constitution and effect a shift to a federal system of government. Critics said this would instill a dictatorship and concentrate power with Duterte. In September 2018, Interior Undersecretary Epimaco Densing reportedly called on Duterte during a public forum to declare a revolutionary government to hasten the country’s transition to a federal system. Densing was spotted in the 2017 Mendiola rally. He was the main guest of a citizens’ group calling itself Mula sa Masa Duterte Movement (MMDM). The next day, Department of the Interior and Local Government Secretary Eduardo Año disowned the stance, and said it was Densing’s opinion. In April 2019, Duterte, outraged at criticisms of his order to review all government contracts, warned he would suspend the writ of habeas corpus and declare a “revolutionary war.” “Pahirapan mo ako, I will declare a revolutionary war until the end of my term, pasensiyahan tayo,” he said. (If you give me a hard time, I will declare a revolutionary war until the end of my term. Live with it.) Vice President Leni Robredo slammed it as an “irresponsible” way of responding to criticism. In December of the same year, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), Cordillera People’s Liberation Army, led a new call for Duterte to declare a revolutionary government. MNLF founder Nur Misuari is a staunch supporter of Duterte’s federalism proposal, which remains pending in Congress. With a revolutionary government, Duterte could pursue federalism without the scrutiny of lawmakers. Legal scholars and critics point out that Duterte need not change the current system to fix persistent problems. Instead, he could invoke emergency powers, which are less prone to abuse.  The possibility of a revolutionary government surfaced again in August 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, as confirmed cases neared 200,000. Hundreds of Duterte supporters gathered in Pampanga to make fresh calls. Supporters wanted a revolutionary government that “shall reign over our country and people, only up to June 30, 2022” and asked for the adoption of a new constitution. Malacañang rejected the calls. Lawyers denounced the claim as unconstitutional while Robredo called it a “big joke.” Robredo, a lawyer herself, said that a call to throw out the Constitution is in itself illegal. University of the Philippines constitutional and political law professor John Molo also said the calls can be seen as inciting to sedition – now an even more sensitive topic under the newly signed Anti-Terrorism Law of 2020. The proponents of the new calls for a revolutionary government could be in danger of violating a law the President himself put priority on in cracking down against terrorism and rebellion. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/trump-grabs-spotlight-reclusive-biden-leads-polls/","title":"Trump grabs spotlight but reclusive Biden leads polls","date":"Aug 16, 2020 11:05 AM PHT","snippet":"History professor Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted the results of every US presidential election since 1984. His 2020 forecast? It's Joe Biden.","body":"Despite being gaffe-prone, getting up in years, and barely heading out on the campaign trail, Democrat Joe Biden is leading in the polls as the coronavirus epidemic and economic crisis make the November presidential election a referendum on Donald Trump. The COVID-19 outbreak has stripped Trump of his beloved campaign rallies but he has made the most of his White House pulpit to remain in the public eye. The 77-year-old Biden, on the other hand, has held few campaign events, spending most of his time since mid-March at home in Wilmington, Delaware.    Biden’s sparse public schedule has minimized the risks of his catching the virus while at the same time reducing his chances of making any faux pas. And if the polls are any indication, the Democratic candidate’s low-key style is paying off. The election website Real Clear Politics has Biden with a 7.7-point lead over Trump nationally.   Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University, has correctly predicted the results of every US presidential election since 1984, including Trump’s upset 2016 victory. His 2020 forecast? Biden, president Barack Obama’s two-term vice president, will win the November 3 vote. “This has nothing to do with Joe Biden,” Lichtman said in an interview with Agence France-Presse. “It’s not dependent on Donald Trump’s personality either. It’s based on the record.” The professor bases his predictions on what he calls the 13 “Keys to the White House.” Among them: How strong is the US economy? Is there social unrest? Is the president an incumbent? Is the president charismatic? Is his opponent? Of this last “key,” Lichtman says “Biden doesn’t fit that bill.”  “He’s a very empathetic, sincere man, but he’s not inspirational,” he said. In late 2019, Lichtman had Trump in good shape to win reelection. “What has happened since is he made the colossal mistake of thinking he can talk his way out of the crises that hit the country, the pandemic, the cries for social justice, the economic downturn,” Lichtman said. “That doesn’t work. And the result is a failed presidency.” With more than 169,000 deaths and over 5.3 million COVID-19 cases, the United States is the worst-hit country in the world with an economy on its knees. The killing of George Floyd, an African-American man, by a white police officer, triggered a summer of nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality. While Trump’s handling of the virus outbreak and the protests has been widely criticized, Biden has been climbing in the polls. The former vice president has been able to largely sit back and watch events unfold, with the Trump campaign accusing him of “hiding” in his Wilmington basement. “By his almost reclusive campaign he has maintained the spotlight on President Trump,” said Christopher Arterton, professor emeritus of political management at George Washington University. And Trump’s management of the crises facing the country has pushed many independent voters “from undecided to, ‘I’m not going to vote for him,'” Arterton said. Despite Biden’s lead in the polls, neither professor is ready to say he has the election locked up, not in these uncertain times and with a candidate as unpredictable as Trump. “He will do anything, he has no scruples,” Lichtman, an avowed Democrat, said of the Republican president. Trump, 74, has suggested that Biden is senile and called him a puppet of the “radical left” who would somehow “hurt God.” There are also three debates scheduled between the two men in September and October which could be the occasion for fireworks. With Trump largely unable to expand his voter base, the real estate tycoon has been accused of trying to suppress the Democratic vote. Lichtman said this could pose dangers for Democratic hopes of regaining the White House. “My big worries about this election are two things that have nothing to do with the keys,” he said. “One is voter suppression. Trump and his enablers are going to make it difficult for people to vote, particularly to vote by mail in a pandemic,” Lichtman said. “And number two, Russian intervention. How effective is their intervention going to be? Because we know Donald Trump not only won’t do anything to stop it, he’ll welcome it again. “Those are two wild cards. No system can take that into account.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/asia-new-normal-curbing-press-freedom-keith-richburg/","title":"Asia’s new normal: Curbing press freedom","date":"Aug 10, 2020 6:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Old authoritarian states are reverting to type. As is often the case in the region, the more things change, the more they stay the same.","body":"This article was originally published on Asialink, Australia’s leading center for creative engagement with Asia. By almost every measure, press freedom in East Asia has suffered a depressing erosion lately. Professional journalists and citizen bloggers have been jailed or slapped with costly defamation suits. Media outlets have had their operating licenses threatened or revoked. Cybersecurity and fake news laws have given autocrats a new cudgel to crack down on reporting they dislike.  Journalists and bloggers trying to provide information about the coronavirus pandemic have been threatened and jailed. And countries are increasingly weaponizing the visa process to keep out or kick out prying foreign correspondents. But as dramatic as this rollback of press freedom has been,\nin East Asia – particularly Southeast Asia­ – this is really just a reversion\nto the mean. For decades, this region has been inhospitable terrain for\nthe press. Independent journalists have long been viewed with suspicion or\noutright hostility. Local journalists for many decades have been straitjacketed with a range of restrictions and governmental “red lines” – topics off-limits to coverage – with many reporters choosing to exercise self-censorship to avoid transgressions. Much of the Asian media was state-owned, meaning they could only report the official government line. For the relatively compact corps of foreign correspondents traversing the region, covering East Asia meant navigating a patchwork of visa requirements and work permits, internal travel restrictions, rejections, revocations and, occasionally, expulsions.  I know; for two years, from 1987 until 1989, I was banned from Indonesia for a single line in an article that went against the Suharto regime’s historical narrative of how it took power. I was blacklisted from Myanmar for years after interviewing Aung San Suu Kyi in 1989. In the 1980s and ‘90s, Myanmar and Laos remained among the least covered countries in the world by the foreign press because of their stinginess in granting visas to journalists.  Other countries like Vietnam and Cambodia only allowed in a large number of foreign reporters for grandiose staged events. Reporters on individual trips were assigned “guides” to monitor their movements. Some forward-looking guides were actually helpful, and would turn a blind eye if you slipped away from your assigned hotel to interview a dissident who was officially off limits to see. But they were the exceptions. The media environment slowly started to change as more and more countries became inspired by the 1986 People Power revolution in the Philippines that toppled the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, and by democratic openings in South Korea and Taiwan.  But the larger impetus was the 1997 Asian economic crisis that collapsed living standards across Asia and forced a new democratic reckoning – reformasi in Indonesia, and a new “people’s constitution” in Thailand that promised to limit the role of the military and the old corrupt provincial elite. Some argued that the democratizing trend in East Asia at the\nturn of the century was “an inevitability,” in the words of Douglas Paal,\npresident of the Asia Pacific Policy Center in Washington, in 1997. It was the\nresult of a more educated and affluent middle class, globalisation, the growth\nof information technology, and the pressure of foreign aid donors. “More and more Asians (are) now choosing their own leaders, throwing out old ones, forming labor unions and advocacy groups outside of government control and publicly clamoring for more democratic rights,” The Washington Post wrote in a December, 1997 article. “Just as democracy swept through Latin America and the former Communist-run states of Eastern Europe at the end of the Cold War, East Asia, too, is in the midst of what many here are calling a slow but steady move toward more pluralism and openness.” I recognize those words because I wrote them. It seemed then an accurate reflection of the times. The democratic optimism was swiftly followed by the explosion of the internet in East Asia. Social media, new online media outlets, and citizen journalists began challenging the state-run media monopoly on information, giving a voice to the voiceless. The trend even spread to China. In 2009, when I landed in Beijing as a correspondent for The Washington Post, China was in the midst of a still-new, largely unregulated online revolution. Citizen journalists, micro bloggers, and online activists were exposing official corruption, highlighting problems like food safety, child kidnapping, and illegal land grabs. They were holding the Communist authorities accountable. And, for the first time, ordinary people had a way to talk back to – and criticize – their leaders. “China’s bloggers are taking risks and pushing for change, one click at a time,” was the headline of a piece I wrote in 2012 analyzing the impact of this new online activism. In addition, Chinese traditional media outlets like Caixin magazine and Southern Weekly in Guangzhou were pushing the boundaries with hard-hitting investigative reporting. But when Xi Jinping ascended to power in late 2012, he set about reining in the online space. New regulations and restrictions were imposed.  Journalists were told that their job was to conform to the party line and follow the “correct political direction.” The anonymity that allowed free speech to flourish online was crushed with new “real name” registration rules. Internet celebrities with large followings, the so-called “Big V’s”, were harassed and some arrested. Bloggers and citizen journalists were jailed. The once freewheeling internet conversation on Weibo, or Chinese Twitter, soon halted. A new national security law imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong on 1 July this year now threatens to stifle the local media in the former British colony, or at the very least create a climate of fear that will likely lead to more self-censorship. The new law calls for more supervision of the media, gives the police unlimited surveillance powers, and could force journalists to turn over their notes and data during national security investigations. (READ: Hong Kong police raid pro-democracy newspaper after owner’s arrest) China’s crackdown on the internet was actually a harbinger\nof the ossifying of nascent democratic trends elsewhere in the region. Where in\nthe late ‘90s and early 2000’s, democracy seemed on an irreversible march\nacross East Asia, the past few years have seen a return to old-style\nauthoritarianism. And a key casualty has been the region’s newfound press\nfreedoms. Indonesia, after the fall of the Suharto “New Order” regime in 1998, saw a flourishing of the local press, and a relaxation of the visa restrictions and blacklists that saw me banned for two years.  But now under President Joko Widodo, the visa is again being weaponized. American journalist, Philip Jacobson, who exposed environmental damage and corruption, was arrested and deported supposedly for violating the terms of his visa. Journalists have been barred from reporting on Papua. Islamic groups threaten to have reporters jailed under the country’s strict laws against blasphemy. An independent media did flourish in the Philippines for a time after the fall of Marcos. But a gun-heavy place long known for violence against journalists, it holds the record for the biggest mass killing of media workers in history – 32 of them – at Maguindanao, a southern province, in 2009. Beyond the bloodshed, the law has proved an effective weapon against the press under the authoritarian President Rodrigo Duterte. Maria Ressa, the founder of the scrappy online investigative news site Rappler, was convicted of cyber libel and faces seven years in prison, and she still is grappling with multiple tax charges, in what is widely seen as official retribution for the site’s critical reporting on Duterte. (LIST: Cases against Maria Ressa, Rappler directors, staff since 2018) One of the Philippines’ largest and most respected television networks, ABS-CBN, had its broadcasting license revoked, in a case also considered punishment for its reporting on the thin-skinned president. Vietnam and Laos, the two unabashedly Communist holdouts, continue to arrest bloggers and journalists. Myanmar appeared a bright spot, following the country’s transition from years of military dictatorship that culminated in free parliamentary elections in 2015. New media outlets flourished during the transition. But Myanmar reverted back to its darker past as journalists were jailed under draconian “state secrets” laws, including two Reuters reporters imprisoned for more than 500 days for covering the military’s persecution of the Rohingya minority in Rakhine state. Thailand also saw a reversion to coups and a military-dominated regime, after a brief dalliance with democracy. Journalists have been jailed under the country’s sweeping cybersecurity law, and the media mutes any criticism of the Thai king because of strict lèse-majesté laws that can lead to a 15-year prison sentence. Strict criminal defamation laws also are used to harass reporters. Cambodia has always been inhospitable to journalists, although there was a brief flourishing of the press after the end of the civil war and the establishment of a quasi-democracy in the 1990s. Newly established outlets like the Phnom Penh Post and the Cambodia Daily provided critical, in-depth coverage. But Prime Minister Hun Sen, who uses his own Facebook page to deride what he considers fake news, has forced the shutdown of dozens of radio stations, the closure of the Cambodia Daily, and the sale of the Phnom Penh Post to a friendly Malaysian businessman. Malaysia was deemed to have turned a corner after the May 2018 election that ended the decades-long rule of the nativist United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and restored nonagenarian Mahathir Mohamed to power. But Malaysia also has backslid, with Steven Gan, the editor-in-chief of the feisty new digital site Malaysiakini, facing contempt of court charges because of reader comments on the site that criticized the judiciary. Separately, Malaysian police investigated journalists from the South China Morning Post and Al Jazeera, for reporting on the plight of migrant workers during the COVID-19 lockdown. Reporters Without Borders ranks 180 countries on its 2020 Press Freedom Index, and in the Asia-Pacific region, only New Zealand ranks in the top ten. Australia comes in at 26, and the next Asian countries are South Korea and Taiwan, at 42 and 43 respectively.  The 10 countries of Southeast Asia only begin to appear at number 136, with the Philippines, and ends with Vietnam at 175 and China at 177, above only Eritrea, Turkmenistan and North Korea. An independent and unshackled press, able to work unimpeded\nand without fear, is a pillar of democratic society, and what is clear is that\nas democracy has receded in Asia, so too has press freedom. For a while, there\nwas the belief that Asia was entering a new more democratic era, and that the\ninternet would become a catalyst for more openness and freedom. It seems Asia’s supposed move toward democracy was largely ephemeral. Old authoritarian states are reverting to type. As is often the case in the region, the more things change, the more they stay the same. – Rappler.com  Keith B.

Brown scored 20 points, Tatum added 18 and Kemba Walker added 17 for the Celtics (46-23), who pulled within 3.5 games of second-place Toronto and 3 ahead of fourth-place Miami. “We’re getting there,” Tatum said. “I don’t want to put a cap on it, say where our ceiling is, but we’re improving every day and we don’t want to stop.” The Celtics, who boasted 7 double-figure scorers, never trailed against the NBA’s second-best defensive squad, jumping ahead 52-37 at halftime and outscoring the Raptors 39-20 in the 3rd quarter. “I don’t think it’s a surprise when your offense is dialed in like that,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Fred VanVleet led Toronto with only 13 points, but the Celtics and Raptors could face each other in the second round of the playoffs and both sides know it could be much different. “They are a good team,” Tatum said. “We’ll probably see them again.” The Brooklyn Nets and Orlando Magic clinched the last two berths in the East playoffs in different fashions. Brooklyn, led by 22 points from Caris LeVert and 21 from Joe Harris, routed Sacramento 119-106. The Nets (33-36) ensured ninth-place Washington could not pull within 4 games to force a play-in series under NBA restart rules. Orlando (32-38) had a chance to win and seal a berth but the Philadelphia 76ers rallied in the second half to beat the Magic, 108-101. Instead, the Magic reached the playoffs when Washington lost to New Orleans, 118-107, leaving the Wizards (24-45) the only winless bubble team and too far back to threaten Orlando. Cameroonian star Joel Embiid had 23 points and 13 rebounds for the 76ers while Tobias Harris added 23 points and 15 rebounds, Al Horford scored 21 and reserve Alec Burks contributed 22. The Magic began the 4th quarter with a 3-for-17 shooting slump from the floor and the 76ers, missing Australian star Ben Simmons due to a left knee injury, went on a 9-1 run over 4:30 for a 97-87 edge to seal it. Sixers coach Brett Brown liked Embiid boosting his game in the second half. “I loved his physical approach. The team needs that and feeds off that,” he said. “There was a physicality we didn’t show much of in the first half.” The Memphis Grizzlies, clinging to 8h in the Western Conference, snapped a four-game restart losing skid by routing Oklahoma City, 121-92. “We’ve learned from it and we’re able to come out and get a win tonight,” Grizzlies rookie star Ja Morant said. “We learned to play 48 minutes of basketball and just be disciplined, trust our teammates, and play hard.” Memphis guard Dillon Brooks scored a game-high 22 points while Morant and Jonas Valanciunas each had 19 points. Oklahoma City, without New Zealand center Steven Adams due to a left leg injury, led by as many as 18 points in the first half but a 70-41 Memphis run produced a 95-78 lead entering the 4th quarter. The Grizzlies, 33-37, finish season games by facing the East’s 3 top teams – Toronto, Boston and NBA wins leader Milwaukee. The Thunder fell to 6th in the West at 42-26, a half-game behind Utah. San Antonio guard Derrick White scored 24 points while Austrian seven-footer Jakob Poeltl added 19 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Spurs over Utah 119-111. The Spurs, seeking a playoff berth for a record 23rd consecutive season, improved to 30-38, one game behind ninth-place Portland and a play-in spot with 3 games remaining. Jordan Clarkson came off the bench to lead the Jazz (43-26) with 24 points. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/tiktok-grab-could-extend-undermine-us-online-dominance/","title":"TikTok grab could extend – or undermine – US online dominance","date":"Aug 6, 2020 2:08 PM PHT","snippet":"Analysts say a tie-up of TikTok with Microsoft may have unintended negative consequences for US firms and the open internet","body":"A tie-up of TikTok with Microsoft could extend American dominance of the online and social media world. But it may have some unintended, negative consequences too for US firms and the open internet. The deal being negotiated with the administration of President Donald Trump would carve out parts of the popular video app for Microsoft, which would gain a foothold in the fast-growing, youth-focused social media environment and join the ranks of rivals like Facebook. Such a deal “would strengthen American preeminence in technology by moving a major consumer product from Chinese ownership,” said Darrell West, director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution.  “But it also could encourage data nationalism by fueling calls in many nations for local control over internet platforms and data storage within their own national borders.” Other analysts said the deal could have far-reaching effects for the idea of an open internet, a longstanding position of Washington in contrast with that of China and other authoritarian regimes which restrict online content. “It would cross a rubicon in terms of internet governance,” said Graham Webster, editor of the DigiChina Project at the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center. “This would result in the US appearing to support the longstanding Chinese position, which is that if they don’t like the way another country’s companies operate, they can ban or seize them. That would be a huge step.” Microsoft said it has been in talks with TikTok parent firm ByteDance to acquire TikTok’s operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and address Washington’s concerns about data security in light of claims that the social platform could become an espionage tool. Trump said he is likely to approve such a deal, and set a mid-September deadline after which he would ban TikTok in the United States. Any deal would give Microsoft a large chunk of the estimated billion-user TikTok base and technology which has helped make the app wildly popular with young smartphone users. The talks come against a backdrop of growing dominance in much of the world of US-based Big Tech firms in social media, online search and advertising, cloud computing and other sectors which have become more important during the coronavirus pandemic. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said the US may be justified in its move because of China’s limits on US firms operating in that country. “China has been imposing these rules on us for the last 25 years,” he said. “If you are an American company setting up in China you need a 49% local owner and you need to give up intellectual property. A Chinese firm in US doesn’t need a US owner sponsor, you just open up shop. The US wants symmetric trade rules.” Susan Aaronson, a professor and head of the Digital Trade and Data Governance hub at George Washington University, said any effort to carve up TikTok could face major hurdles and lead to negative consequences. “They can’t divide up the app, no such thing has ever been done,” Aaronson said, adding that there has been no clarity on how a sale would affect TikTok in dozens of countries. Aaronson said Trump’s “bullying” of TikTok and ByteDance could encourage other countries to take similar actions, possibly against American firms which dominate the non-Chinese internet ecosystem. “The whole thesis of the internet is data should flow freely across borders,” Aaronson said. “If you’re bullying and acting as a nationalist the internet gets more divided.” Webster said the large US tech firms could face consequences from what might be seen as an “expropriation” of TikTok. “It could be extremely costly if one of these (US) firms is forced to spin off part of its operations,” he said. More fundamentally, Webster said a forced TikTok sale would represent a step away from globalization which has benefited the Silicon Valley giants. “The US position has been that companies should be able to do business across borders, and that openness is beneficial to US companies,” he said. The divesting of TikTok “might set in motion a pattern of localization of online services” which the US and its companies have opposed, he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-resumes-services-cebu-august-2020/","title":"Grab resumes services in Cebu after 5 months offline","date":"Aug 3, 2020 7:27 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab will waive their cut of drivers' earnings for the first two weeks of operation","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines – After 5 months off the road, Grab resumes services in Cebu City and Talisay City, the company announced on Monday, August 3.  “As Cebu City reopens its economy, Grab is one with the city in protecting the lives and livelihoods of the Cebuanos,” Grab said in a press statement.

The Wednesday, July 15, vote was the first parliamentary election since the Social Democrats added “North” to the Balkan country’s name last year – a move that ended a decades-old dispute with Greece but was highly controversial at home. The historic accord ushered the country into NATO and opened the door to future EU membership. But critics are still bitter about conceding a part of their identity to appease Athens, which was blocking the EU path because it claimed exclusive rights to the name Macedonia for its own neighboring region. Lacking an outright majority with some 36% of the vote, the center-left Social Democrats will now face tough coalition talks that could drag on for weeks before a government is formed. That could mean a leadership void at a time when coronavirus infections are surging and the country’s already weak economy is headed towards a pandemic-triggered recession. According to projections by the state election commission, the Social Democrats are in line for 46 seats in the 120-member assembly, followed by 44 from their right-wing rivals VMRO-DPMNE, though the numbers are still subject to change. If Social Democrat leader and former prime minister Zoran Zaev fails to muster the necessary alliances, VMRO-DPMNE would be allowed to try. The party is formally pro-EU but has been highly critical of the name deal, lambasting it as “treason” and appealing to nationalists in a country that has faced identity battles with neighbors since emerging from former Yugoslavia in 1991. “Our path to progress is confirmed,” Zaev said in a victory speech after midnight Wednesday.  “The citizens went out and voted for a clear future, for unity and solidarity, for economic patriotism, for law and order,” the 45-year-old said. At opposition headquarters meanwhile, VMRO-DPMNE secretary general Igor Janusev insisted the vote still showed that “people want change.” Despite the first-place finish, the Social Democrats fared slightly worse than in the last poll in 2016, when they ultimately ended VMRO-DPMNE’s nearly decade-long reign, a period marked by repression and corruption under now self-exiled former strongman Nikola Gruevski. There is a perception that beyond the progress with the EU talks, the Social Democrats have “not delivered on some of the key promises, including justice reforms,” said Elena Stavrevska, a political scientist at the London School of Economics. Low wages, high unemployment and widespread corruption have also been gnawing away at public faith in politics for years. “We have had enough of promises, now it is time for progress,” said 70-year-old Dimitar Sumkovski, a voter in the capital Skopje. The elections were held to replace a caretaker government that took over after Zaev stepped down 6 months ago following the EU’s initial failure to open accession talks – a promise Brussels had made in exchange for the name change and other reforms. The bloc later gave the green light in March, although Skopje is still waiting for a date to start formal negotiations. Analysts predicted “difficult” coalition talks ahead.  “We are going into a period of hard party negotiations,” said political analyst Nikola Spasov, warning of instability ahead. The top options for junior partners are parties representing the ethnic Albanian minority, who make up around a quarter of the two million population. The Democratic Union for Integrity (DUI) was ranked third with some 15 seats followed by another rival Albanian camp with 12, according to the election commission. DUI, the traditional kingmaker, has this year demanded that its candidate be named prime minister in exchange for any alliance. Zaev – whose camp is already allied with a smaller Albanian party – has previously shot down the proposal as “blackmail.” With nearly 400 deaths from COVID-19, the landlocked country has the highest per capita fatality rate in the Western Balkans, according to official data. On Wednesday, masks were mandatory at polling stations, which closed later than normal to allow for more social distancing.  Those infected with the virus were able to cast ballots earlier in the week, as were the elderly and infirm. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/goodrap/264290-how-grab-making-things-need-miss-within-reach/","title":"How Grab is making the things we need (and miss) just within reach","date":"Jun 20, 2020 12:03 PM PHT","snippet":"Meet some of the people whose “everyday wishes” were granted during the general community quarantine","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Before the pandemic, we seldom gave a second thought to our routine. Grabbing our daily caffeine fix. Eating in our favorite restaurants. Commuting to work. But now that we continue to spend our days devoid of normalcy despite the easing of quarantine rules, many are missing everyday things no matter how mundane they seem.   Grab, Southeast Asia’s leading everyday app, understands that adapting to this new reality may be challenging for most of us. So, to bring comfort and delight to Filipinos in these trying times, they’re helping us re-experience the things that we miss about our normal lives through the #SagotKita project. Through a crowdsourcing social post published last June 6, Grab randomly chose 3 lucky people and granted their everyday wishes. Rose Tapang-Feliciano, finding comfort in hakaw and her husband  Rose was busy preparing to move out of her housing unit inside the UP Campus before the pandemic struck. “I opted for early retirement as a faculty member of the UP College of Mass Communication effective January 2020,” she said.  At first, she didn’t mind the lockdown and being quarantined at home since she was preoccupied with sorting and packing. The reality of the enhanced community quarantine only hit her when she realized she and her husband couldn’t move their things out. “We were indeed locked in with no freedom of movement – us and our stuff!” When she saw Rappler’s post last June 6, she was at first dubious. But then she thought, “katuwaan kung baga” so she wrote her answer – visiting her 90-year-old mother in Baguio monthly and eating yang chow rice, sweet and sour pork, and hakaw with her husband at HapChan.  Two days after, she received a message from Grab. She was so surprised that she checked the Facebook page of the person who messaged her, thinking it might be a prank. “But it was kinda funny because just an hour before I got the message from Grab, I had just ordered wonton noodles and siopao from HapChan for our snacks, which my husband and I agreed would already be our dinner,” Rose said. “Then the message came! It’s a good thing that what I wished for was different from what I ordered for our merienda. As an afterthought, I jokingly told my husband, ‘Sana dinagdagan ko pa yung wish ko!’ Totoo pala ang news/promo na ito’ (I should have wished for more. This news/promo is true)”.  Analyn Tenedero, providing milk for her child  Analyn Tenedoro has 7 children. With her meager income from selling fruits in the streets and her husband out of job because of the community quarantine, she’s thankful to Grab for granting her wish.   “Wala na po kasi kaming pambili ng gatas dahil sa mahal na presyo. Pero yun lang po ang nirerekomenda ng doctor ng heart center (We can’t afford to buy it because it’s expensive. But we have no choice because it’s the only milk recommended by my child’s doctor at the heart center), she said.   She was so excited to receive the milk for her child that they waited outside as soon as she was informed that GrabExpress is on its way. “Maraming-maraming salamat po dahil pinagbigyan niyo ang wish ko (Thank you so much for granting my wish),” she said.  James Velasco, hustling with the help of his wife It’s not just them that Grab has been trying to help adapt to the new reality. They’ve also been granting the wishes of their driver-partners and providing relief as they continue to work amid the health crisis. James is a part-time GrabExpress rider and volunteer messenger for AcessiWheels, a PWD transportation service. Ever since the community quarantine started, his wife, Mean, had to scrimp on their budget. So even though his worn-out pair of shoes for work already needed replacing, it had to wait because they had to prioritize their household expenses.   This is why James was so surprised when Mean suddenly gave him a new pair of high cut shoes. “Huli ko na po nalaman eh. Nung natanggap ko na, saka niya lang sinabi kung saan galing (I only knew where the shoes came from when she gave it to me),” he said.  Through GrabPay, Grab was able to grant her wish for a new pair of shoes to help protect her husband’s prosthetic leg. This opportunity, Mean said, came at a perfect time because it served as a belated birthday gift and advanced Father’s day gift for James.   To show their commitment to being every Filipino’s partner in life, Grab continues to provide various services to help the public perform personal and business transactions while still observing proper health measures through GrabPay, GrabExpress, GrabMart, and GrabFood.  Aside from granting wishes for things Filipinos miss, Grab is also giving over 100 deals for us to enjoy from June 8 until July 5: As Grab celebrates its 8th anniversary this year, they want to assure us that they got our backs. “Si Grab muna ang bahala.”  – Rappler.com  Grab assures Filipinos that they have a partner in threading this new normal.

That was in full display in the inaugural FIBA Esports Open as Team Pilipinas ripped Indonesia to pieces by a combined 61 points in the first two games of their best-of-five series on Friday, June 19.  Point guard Aljon “Shintarou” Cruzin shone the brightest for the Philippines after posting 22 points, 7 assists, and 3 rebounds in the 56-29 Game 1 win and 23 points and 4 rebounds in the 64-30 Game 2 triumph. Cruzin ran roughshod over Indonesia, catching his defenders off guard with his nifty dribble moves to either attack the basket or shoot an open three-pointer. His best play of Day 1 came at the end of Game 1 after he pulled off a double crossover and slammed home a ferocious dunk over two Indonesia big men.       Team Pilipinas struggled early in Game 2 and fell to a 9-12 deficit but managed to turn the tides late in the first half behind the defense of small forward Custer “Aguila” Galas, a former NBA 2K Asia Tournament champion. Creating an avatar that resembled four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallance, Galas served as the defensive anchor for the Philippines as he finished with 17 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals.  Going into the final quarter of Game 2, Team Pilipinas already built an insurmountable 42-18 lead en route to the 34-point victory.  “From the start, the order for us was shoot to kill, from the first quarter to the fourth quarter,” team captain Philippe “Izzo” Alcaraz Herrero IV, who had 3 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 steals in Game 2, said in Filipino.  Power forward Clark “Clark” Banzon had 11 points, 4 assists, 3 rebounds, and 3 steals in Game 2, while shooting guard Rial “Rial” Polog Jr added 10 points, 4 assists, and 4 steals in the win.  The games were played in the ProAm mode of NBA 2K with five-minute quarters. Team Pilipinas will play Indonesia for Games 3 and 4 on Saturday, June 20. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/263992-grab-job-cuts-june-2020/","title":"Grab to cut 360 jobs due to coronavirus impact on business","date":"Jun 16, 2020 6:29 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab CEO Anthony Tan explains 'the pandemic will likely result in a prolonged recession and we have to prepare for what may be a long recovery period'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing company Grab announced it would be cutting 360 jobs, or just under 5% of its workforce due to “the stark impact of COVID-19 on businesses globally, ours included.” Grab CEO Anthony Tan said in a blog post on Tuesday, June 16, that “the pandemic will likely result in a prolonged recession and we have to prepare for what may be a long recovery period.” “Over the past few months, we reviewed all costs, cut back on discretionary spending, and implemented pay cuts for senior management. In spite of all this, we recognize that we still have to become leaner as an organization in order to tackle the challenges of the post-pandemic economy,” he added. Tan explained the measure was done in line with other initiatives – such as shutting down some non-core projects and right-sizing teams – to reduce the number of jobs cut. To save more jobs, Grab also refocused its efforts on redeploying Grabbers “to meet the increased customer demand for deliveries.” (READ: Grab expands grocery delivery service GrabMart) “We were able to save many jobs through this redeployment of resources and it helped limit the scope of the reduction exercise to just under 5%,” he said.

The Korean LPGA Championship – featuring 3 of the world’s top 10 women players – grabbed global attention, with broadcasting rights sold to countries including the US, Canada and Australia. Normally overlooked outside South Korea, the tournament is the first high-level women’s golf event to be played since the US-based LPGA suspended its season in February.  Park Hyun-kyung prevailed at Lakewood Country Club in Yangju, scoring her first victory since turning pro in 2018 to claim $180,000 of the $2.5 million purse.   She shot a final-round five-under-par 67 to finish 17 under for the tournament – a shot ahead of Bae Seon-woo (68) and third-round leader Lim Hee-Jeong (71). “The moment I had always dreamt of finally has come true,” a tearful Park told cable channel SBS Golf.  World No. 3 and double-major winner Park Sung-hyun missed the cut, 6th-ranked Kim Sei-young finished two under for the tournament for joint 46th, while world No. 10 Lee Jeong-eun finished 15th at nine under. To avoid the risk of coronavirus infection, players were advised to keep 2 meters (6 feet) apart on the course and minimize physical contact, while touching the pin without gloves was prohibited.   Players also had to wear masks before and after their rounds, but could choose whether or not to do so during play – with most deciding against. The 20-year-old champion was congratulated by her mask-wearing peers with elbow-bumps, and held up the trophy at the prize-giving ceremony while also wearing a mask.  South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the disease outside mainland China but brought it under control with a widespread “trace, test and treat” program. Professional football and baseball both resumed this month – albeit behind closed doors. Only 4 LPGA Tour events have been completed this year – the last in Adelaide in February – but the tour has outlined plans to resume in mid-July in Michigan.

He earned a few hundreds selling fish after a contact tapped him as a reseller in his community. It was lower than what Noli used to get in the construction site, yes, but it beats going to bed hungry at night. This gave him and his wife, Josie*, a routine during the dragging weeks since President Rodrigo Duterte placed Luzon and neighboring areas under lockdown.  They both woke up early, with Josie preparing breakfast while Noli readied himself while waiting for the day’s chestful of fish to be delivered. He usually waited right in front of their house, a few feet away from the front door.  On April 5, just like any other day, the couple proceeded with their routine. Little did they know that this time, their lives would be changed.  Noli was arrested by alleged police a little past 9 am that day. He was told he was not wearing a mask and was considered a tambay, a loiterer. Josie saw them forcefully grab her husband, a frail man in his late 30s, by his arm.  “Nakiusap naman na walang ginagawa iyong asawa ko, hinihintay lang iyong paninda niya, ilang hakbang lang iyong mula sa pintuan namin,” she told Rappler. “Pero hindi pinakinggan, huhulihin pa rin daw nila.” (I was begging them that he wasn’t doing anything wrong, he was just waiting for the delivery of fish that he was going to sell a few steps from our house. But they didn’t listen, they said they would still arrest him.)  Josie went to the detention place the following day to beg for his release. But no amount of begging sufficed. Instead, she recalled being told the key to her husband’s freedom was P2,000.  Josie knew they didn’t have that money. Determined to help Noli, she borrowed from a “5-6” lender, even if she had no idea how to repay the loan. “Kumagat ako kasi sa kailangan na kailangan ko po mailabas ang asawa ko kasi iyong takot namin,” she said. “Natanim sa isip ko na baka mangyari sa kanya ‘yung mga nangyayari sa iba.”  (I had no choice because I really needed to get my husband out of that place because we were afraid. It was already planted in my head that what happened to others could happen to them.) Josie had every reason to worry for Noli’s welfare inside. She saw in the news what happened to those detained, be it in her own city or in other local government units. On April 9, her husband was finally released.  Noli spent a total of 4 days detained, an ordeal that greatly affected him, according to his wife.  She said he’s now traumatized and refuses to go out. He ceased selling fish, further decreasing the family’s budget for necessities during the lockdown. The sound of heavy steps outside their home rattles Noli, Josie said. The trips to the community water station become tense, with Noli constantly looking over his shoulder for any sign of the police.  “Nakakapanghina, nakakaawa, mapapaisip ka bakit sila ganyan?” Josie said. “Puwede naman nila tiketan lang, bakit kailangang hulihin? Hindi naman sila kriminal, naghahanap-buhay lang naman.”  (It has left us drained, pitiful, we can’t help but wonder why they are that way. They could have just issued violators a ticket instead of detaining them. They are not criminals. They are just looking for a way to earn a living.)   All vulnerable Incidents of abuse like what Noli experienced cuts across class lines, as the PNP and the government have vowed a stringent enforcement of lockdown rules in all communities. On April 20, 4 cops stormed the high-end Pacific Plaza Towers (PPT) condominium complex in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City, threatening guards with arrest if they were not allowed in, and then accosting residents who did not wear face masks and allegedly did not practice physical distancing in common areas. They carried guns without warrants. Two days later, a Quezon City cop shot dead a schizophrenic and traumatized former soldier, Winston Ragos, for allegedly threatening the life of cops by attempting to pull something inside his sling bag. Cops believe it was a gun, but witnesses and relatives said it was just a water bottle.  On April 26, a Spanish citizen staying in Makati City, Javier Salvador Parra, was tackled to the ground by a cop arresting him after his house help did not wear a face mask while watering their house plants. Just a day later, Quezon City local officials mauled and dragged a fish vendor named Michael Rubuia for failing to wear a face mask and not bringing a quarantine pass while selling outdoors.  Based on the events so far, the poor are still most vulnerable to overzealous cops. The incidents in the upscale areas were both the result of local officials calling the cops in. In Taguig, Mayor Lino Cayetano called the police to enter PPT. In Makati, the barangay captain, Rosana Hwang, asked cops to patrol inside Dasmariñas village.  The victims in less developed areas were all, in the language of cops, “chanced upon” in checkpoints and patrols. The incidents are also not unique to the coronavirus epicenter Metro Manila, as there have been reported cases of abuse in the provinces, too. In Mexico, Pampanga, 3 LGBTQ+ people were ordered by a barangay captain to kiss each other and perform a “sexy” dance in front of a minor on April 5, as a way of punishing them for violating curfew. Intensifying the shame, the barangay captain, Christopher Bombing Punzalan, broadcast the punishment on his Facebook account and read out their names to viewers. There is no law that prescribes any of the punishments Punzalan gave the alleged violators. On April 19, former Anakpawis representative Ariel Casilao and several others who were on their way to deliver relief goods were detained in Norzagaray, Bulacan on their way to deliver relief goods.  They said cops did not explain why they were arrested, and why their donations were taken and turned over to local officials.

Not all have been arrested. Most of the incidents led to enforcers warning violators — a total of 104,073. Some 9,209 have been fined, while 38,817 have been arrested. Graphing the day-to-day data shows that most violations were recorded at the onset of the lockdown: 8,205 violations were recorded on March 17. Of that number 1,163 were arrested. Majority were still only warned, as they comprised 6,657 incidents. On March 28, arrests shot up to 2,650, surpassing warnings that dropped to 2,153 from 3,132 the previous day.  The spike in arrests came 3 days after President Rodrigo Duterte signed the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act of 2020, which became a new national basis for filing cases against violators.  Prior to its signing, cops had to wait for local government units to pass ordinances that penalize quarantine violators before they could make arrests. Since then, the number of violators recorded rose and fell between 2,200 to 3,300 a day. The last peak of the recorded violators reached 4,130 on April 15.  On April 24, warnings dropped to zero. The steep decline began on April 22, a day after the PNP national headquarters said police would no longer issue warnings. In the same days, arrests rose slightly from 778 to 1,098. Police have done more arrests than issued warnings and collected fines ever since. With such rising apprehensions and arrests, victims of abuse in the hands of police and military have turned to organizations such as the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) for help.  Since the lockdown began on March 15, the CHR has been on the receiving end of complaints through its hotlines, emails, and social media accounts.  As of April 29, the CHR has received 368 requests for assistance and complaints, coming mostly from the National Capital Region, Central Luzon, and Calabarzon.  Its investigators and lawyers are still deployed to the field to probe into these complaints, majority of which are related to “alleged torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment and punishment; accounts of illegal arrests and/or detentions, as well as requests for assistance with regards relief goods or the government emergency subsidy.” “The number of violations arising from policies related to the lockdown may be attributed to the lack of or unclear guidelines to implement them as well as overzealousness in applying the quarantine,” CHR said. Human rights sidelined Several groups have called out the government for its lack of a human rights-based approach in addressing the pandemic. On the other hand, there are existing discourses by the administration on how much authority can be exercised during a crisis. This is where the challenge arises from, according to CHR, when the concept of human rights continues to be “largely misunderstood and underappreciated” by those in power. “The way human rights have been regarded, or disregarded, has an effect on how we see and treat people and, in a way, shapes policies and their implementation,” the commission said. Citizens should follow and respect rules set during the lockdown, CHR said, but violators should not be treated inhumanely. Law enforcers should “equally exhibit respect and practice maximum tolerance.” But can a public health emergency erase one’s rights? Some necessary measures may lead to certain restrictions, but the United Nations said that these should meet the requirements of “legality, necessity and proportionality, and be non-discriminatory.”  Specifically, UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned authorities that emergency powers should be used only to address the pandemic “nothing more, nothing less.” Going beyond may be disastrous. Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates (PAHRA) chairperson Nymia Simbulan, meanwhile, believes that the role of the military and police in the coronavirus pandemic should not have been this big.  The policies and public statements of the administration, including authorities turning a blind eye to human rights violations, are reminiscent of the government’s violent anti-illegal drug campaign. “The state’s handling of this public health crisis did not veer away from the way it handled the illegal drug problem in the country,” Simbulan said. “It’s actually a duplication or a replication of the very violent strategy of the state.” These factors, she said, only showed the government’s disregard of a human rights-based approach to the coronavirus pandemic, something that many groups have urged since the beginning of the crisis. Take for example the constant use of the rhetoric of war, according to Simbulan, which only justifies the blatant show of force in the form of deployment of police and military in areas where they are not normally seen. “They’re making themselves highly visible to the people to the point that it’s already normal to be seeing men in uniform with high-powered guns roaming around the community,” Simbulan said. “It reinforces the role of state violence as a key tool and instrument in addressing the problem,” she added.  The value of upholding human rights should not be lost on the government, CHR said, as authorities should always remember that “the protection of our human rights is the very reason why we fight against the COVID-19.”  Drug war blueprint? Under quarantine, the Philippine National Police uses the same operational procedures as when it deals with criminals, but with a different goal in mind. “The purpose of the quarantine is to restrict movement of the people who could be carriers of the virus,” Joint Task Force COVID Shield chief Police Lieutenant General Guillermo Eleazar told Rappler in an interview on April 14. They continue to follow the rules imposed by their operational manual that they have been using in the controversial anti-drug campaign Oplan Double Barrel and checkpoint operations. They follow the same rules of engagement: that cops should only apply “necessary and reasonable force to overcome resistance put up by the offender; subdue the clear and imminent danger posed by him; or to justify the force/act under the principles of self-defense, defense of relative, or defense of stranger.” This has taken on a new meaning under the Duterte administration, specifically since the beginning of the anti-drug campaign, where cops have been advised to “neutralize” suspects who threaten their lives. This could mean disabling the suspects, or in less ideal situations, killing them. Duterte took this further by ordering the police to “shoot dead” unruly violators, particularly those who threaten a cop’s life. Three weeks later, Winston Ragos was killed in Quezon City. The issue of trespassing without warrants has also repeatedly cropped up in the enforcement of quarantine rules in the Dasmariñas Village and PPT incidents. No less than retired Supreme Court associate justice Antonio Carpio said the police’s actions possibly violated the right to be secure in one’s home. Police argue that they were invited into PPT and Dasmariñas Village. The arguments on the violation of domicile harks back to the same legal arguments undertaken by the Supreme Court in 2017 on whether cops can just knock on the doors of people they suspect of committing crime and then investigate.  The scrutiny of the drug war has led to a renewal of policy in the drug campaign, including the requirement of human rights officers in operations to prevent incidents of abuse. This development has not been replicated for quarantine law enforcement. For law enforcement under quarantine, the police follow the guidelines of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), which has been criticized for giving vague, piecemeal guidelines, and local government units that pass their own ordinances to match their own pandemic problems. A source told Rappler that the PNP has submitted clearer “protocols” for policemen for the IATF to pass as a resolution. Eleazar, meanwhile, said they have no problem with the set-up as they only follow the policies of the national government, and local cops should know what their local officials have passed into law in their jurisdictions. Changed lives  The human rights violations reported during the lockdown, and the possible lack of accountability as warned by groups, stem from a culture of impunity that has dominated the country since the violent drug war began in 2016. The police force roaming the streets and looking over citizens in different local government units, after all, are the same ones at the helm of Duterte’s flagship program that has taken thousands of lives. They, too, are changing a lot of lives in the pandemic.  It’s been almost a month since the unfortunate incident involving cops and Josie’s husband Noli. Their lives, already upended by the coronavirus pandemic, faces renewed hardship. Josie, taking over the reins in the household, now goes out every morning to find any chance of earning money to put food on their table.  But what used to be straightforward travel to and from their home has become more complicated, with Josie going through alleys just to avoid checkpoints. She said she’d rather walk a longer distance instead of passing by police or even village watchmen.  The sight of them transports Josie back to one month ago, she said, haunted by the shouts of Noli, the stern voices of the men who arrested him, and her own frantic cries. – Rappler.com *Names of interviewees have been changed for their protection TOP PHOTO:  ON ALERT.

Just wanted to check in on how you guys are doing, though I have a pretty good idea of what you’re going through. Let me guess…    Tired and dejected after lining up at supermarkets for 8 hours only to find most shelves gutted? Paranoid that the slightest lapse in physical distancing will lead your senior citizen parents to an overburdened emergency room – and to their death? Waking up in a cold sweat at night, the terror of whole months of possible unemployment looming over you, its nefarious cousin Hunger waiting in the shadows, claws out and fangs bared? (READ: ‘A mess’: Coronavirus economic impact on Philippines worse than projected) That’s how most of us have been feeling. And I know that’s how you’ve been feeling too, because it’s not like your fate has ever been disentangled from ours. You are Filipino citizens too, and have always been. Whatever fate befalls us befalls you too, except that for the longest time, it was fairly easy for you to believe that your actions would never end up biting you back.   But that’s the thing: given the nature of your transgressions, of course there would be serious consequences soon enough. You play around with democracy in a country sorely in need of good leaders, and you think it’s not going to affect you in a major way? What did you think would happen? That you’d orchestrate the election of malicious power-grabbers and not be beholden to their incompetence? For people who got paid millions for that job, your lack of foresight is embarrassing. (READ: Chief disinformation architects in the PH: Not exactly who you think) I’ll never forget that tidbit in Cabanes and Ong’s study where one of you, when asked how she could even sleep at night given how unethical her job was, related the work to being like Game of Thrones’ Olenna Tyrell – a powerful matriarch moving the pieces around and manipulating the playing field.  Well, Olenna’s dead.   Thanks partly to your decision to use your skills for disinformation, choosing to be architects of entire networks of paid liars and bullies, we now have government officials who are barely doing anything to stem this deadly pandemic. We have a President who has all but gone AWOL despite having over P200 billion to use for this crisis. We have a health secretary who finds it far more urgent to kiss ass than save lives. We have a senator inconsiderate and self-centered enough to actually walk around a hospital knowing full well that he could be COVID-positive and not admit that this was probably the dumbest, most dangerous thing anyone in public office has ever done in decades.   This hot mess – that’s not just on them. There’s blood on your hands, too. They wouldn’t be in power if it weren’t for you.  The very least you can feel about all of this is a huge and crushing regret, and a conviction never to take on the job of chief disinformation architect ever again. Hopefully, it has finally occurred to you what your fun little Game of Thrones role play can do, and that you can manage to mine out that tiny speck of dignity you have left buried within you and try to right your wrongs however way you can.   This is just a naïve hope on my end, I know, but there isn’t much else I can do from the prison of my own home.  It gets pretty maddening being stuck here, knowing this isn’t going to end anytime soon.

Amid the coronavirus outbreak and the Metro Manila lockdown starting Sunday, March 15, these hardworking delivery riders are still committed to bringing restaurants’ meals straight to your doorstep, just with several safety measures in tow now – and as they should. Although ordering from home is what’s safer and more convenient at the moment, remember that ordering online also puts delivery riders and service providers at risk for exposure. Don’t forget to show your appreciation for their unwavering service, and limit your deliveries! FoodPanda’s precautions On Friday, March 13, FoodPanda sent out an email to their customers, informing them that they have “gone the extra mile” to ensure the health of both their riders and customers.  FoodPanda riders with any “slightest sign of illness” are advised to self-quarantine until all symptoms disappear. If a rider has traveled to at least one country on the “black list of travel destinations,” they are immediately placed on a 14-day quarantine.  FoodPanda has also implemented “hygiene practices” in all rider hubs, which include mandatory temperature checks twice a day for employees and regular checks for riders.  Working-from-home arrangements and conference calls are also in place for the office employees. A split team arrangement is also enforced to reduce person-to-person contact, and all business-travel trips will be suspended until at least the end of March. Sterilization of rider bags at the end of every shift are also strictly enforced. Riders are briefed to keep hand sanitizers with them at all times, and to wash their hands every two hours and after each time they handle food. They are also reminded of social distancing guidelines while in public transport. FoodPanda also encourages customers to switch to online payment instead to “keep unnecessary interactions to a minimum.” GrabFood’s safety measures Grab Philippines’ food arm GrabFood also posted a list of safety guidelines on their website to “ensure the health and safety” of their partners and their customers. Firstly, riders are asked to do a mandatory “self-check” of COVID-19 symptoms, which include “fever, cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath.” If any are present, Grab riders are tasked to go offline and head to a hospital. If cleared of COVID-19, the disease brought by the novel coronavirus, a medical certificate is needed to prove that they are “fit for work.”  If any rider turns out to be a DOH-announced confirmed COVID-19 case, Grab will help provide compensation and medical assistance, as well as to those under DOH-mandated quarantine.  Grab reminds their riders to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, and have hand alcohol with them at all times. They must also spray the inside and outside of their delivery bag with disinfectant spray after every delivery, and practice “contactless delivery” –  leaving the customer’s order on top of the delivery bag, in front of their door, or at the building’s reception, move away 6 feet, and then wait for the customer to get their order.  Grab also encourages GrabPay, their cashless payment system, as much as possible. If cash is the only way, customers are advised to place it an envelope and leave it for the rider to pick up. Grab delivery-partners must have regular temperature checks, and are advised to strengthen their immune system, avoid touching their faces, use a face mask, and cover their nose and mouth when they sneeze or cough. – Rappler.com Order your favorite 8 Cuts Burger now with this GrabFood promo.

Lucia outclassed their respective foes to punch their second win in the 2020 Philippine SuperLiga Grand Prix tournament on Saturday, March 7 at FilOil Flying V Centre in San Juan City. The Blaze Spikers continued to ride on a strong start to their title defense campaign as they swept Chery Tiggo, 25-17, 25-22, 25-21. The reigning queens banked on import Katherine Bell, who unloaded 19 out of her 20 points from attacks while Ces Molina scored 15 points and had 5 of her squad’s 7 aces. Petron mainstay Aiza Maizo-Pontillas had 9 points as Remy Palma tallied 5 markers.   Coming from a strong performance in the opening set, the Blaze Spikers ended up knotted with Chery Tiggo at 18 in the 2nd frame before they unloaded 5 straight unanswered points, capped off by back-to-back kills from Molina. Although the Crossovers momentarily held a slim 11-8 separation in the 3rd set, the Blaze Spikers quickly trimmed their deficit and Bell later delivered one from the backrow to give Petron the upperhand, 19-16, before Aiza Maizo-Pontillas provided the finishing touches. Tatjana Bokan, who scored 33 points in Cherry Tiggo’s debut win against Marinerang Filipina, carried the offensive load with 21 points.   F2 Logistics edges Cignal Despite the absence of head coach Ramil de Jesus and veteran Aby Maraño, tournament favorite F2 Logistics still got their second win of the conference over Cignal, 25-23, 25-23, 22-25, 25-15. Import Lindsay Stalzer led the scoring for the Cargo Movers with 26 points while Fil-Hawaiian spiker Kalei Mau added 19 markers to topple Cignal, which fielded veteran skipper Jovelyn Gonzaga as starting libero. The Cargo Movers asserted their dominance from the get-go as they used a 4-0 run capped off by Stalzer’s attack to extend their lead 19-12 in the 1st set.  Cignal fought back and cut the lead to just one, 21-20, but Mau and Stalzer neutralized the late surge fueled by Simon to secure the set. The HD Spikers gave the Cargo Movers another scare in the 2nd set, where they evened the score at 23. But a costly service error from May Luna cut off Cignal’s momentum as Baron sent back Liannes Castaneda Simon’s attack to avert a total collapse.  Tides turned in the 3rd set as the HD Spikers got the lead, 17-14, all thanks to their Cuban import and the additional firepower brought by Fiola Ceballos.  Mau, however, led F2’s fightback and scored 3 straight points to give the lead back to their side 18-17. Cignal held their ground and halted Stalzer’s late comeback efforts to survive another set.  The Cargo Movers quickly shrugged off their 3rd set mishaps and pulled away in the 4th as Alex Cabanos extended their lead to double-digits, 21-11, after back-to-back  service aces. Simon fired 26 markers while Ceballos added 10 points for Cignal, which missed the service of starting libero Jheck Dionela.   Tubino, Sta. Lucia outclass Marinerang Filipina Sta Lucia leaned on Royse Tubino’s scoring barrage to spoil Hana Cutura and the Marinerang Filipina in 4 sets, 25-19, 21-25, 30-28, 25-20. The Realtors neutralized the 29-point performance of Lady Skippers import Hana Cutura as veteran skipper Tubino fired 24 points while import Sheinah Joseph and MJ Phillips chipped in 19 and 15 points, respectively, for the Realtors to remain unbeaten after two games. The Lady Skippers used an 8-0 run to get back in the game and trimmed Realtors’ lead to just one, 20-19, before Tubino sparked a counter 5-0 rally to avert a meltdown in the opening set. Sta Lucia found itself clinging on a slim 21-19 lead in the 2nd frame after MJ Phillips hammered down a kill.  Judith Abil, though, came through the clutch for Marinerang Filipina and scored 3 of the last 6 points to snatch away the set from the Realtors.  The error-laden 3rd set went back and forth as Tubino and Cutura exchanged bombs late, but the veteran hitter of Sta Lucia found some help from Philips and Joseph to put the extended set in their control. Both squads tightly tangled in the 4th before Tubino and Joseph paired up once again to give the Realtors a comfortable 23-17 advantage, just enough to later deal the Lady Skippers a 0-2 start in the conference. The former University of the East standout Abil added 11 points for Marinerang Filipina. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/tech-and-innovation/252919-grab-food-aim-help-filipinos-thrive-digital-economy/","title":"Grab for Good: Grab Philippines aims to help Filipinos thrive in the  digital economy","date":"Feb 28, 2020 11:47 AM PHT","snippet":"We sat down with Grab Philippines’ executives to talk about their mission to improve lives through tech","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab’s journey began with an ambition – to provide a safer transportation option for Filipino commuters. A few years after launching their transport services in the Philippines, they saw an even bigger opportunity to improve people’s lives. From “GrabTaxi”, they went with just “Grab” to complement their renewed ambition –  to be an everyday, everything app.  Today, whether you’re referring to how you’ll get home or where you’ll get food (Mag ga-grab lang ako), the word “Grab” has become synonymous with convenience. RJ Cabaluna, Grab Philippines’ country marketing head, said that he’d describe 2019 as a year that GrabFood and GrabPay have grown so much.  GrabFood just celebrated their 1st anniversary last November yet with the milestones that they’ve achieved, having been recognized by a global market research firm as the most used food delivery platform in the Philippines, it’s as if they’ve been in the playing field long enough to know what makes every Pinoy tick.  This inspired GrabFood Philippines Head EJ dela Vega and his team to amp up their efforts to provide more economic opportunities for Filipinos. Now, they’re in more than 37 areas in the Philippines including Laguna, Pampanga, Metro Cebu, Bacolod, and Iloilo. This means that Grab currently has more than 10,000 merchant-partners that range from luxury restaurants, fast-food chains, down to mom-and-pop stores and Makati’s famous Jolly Jeeps.   24 Chicken, one of the recognized breakthrough merchants at Grab’s first Golden Lunchbox Awards credits GrabFood for their increased revenue. “When GrabFood was introduced to us, our sales doubled or sometimes even tripled. From 1 branch, we now have around 10 branches in two years because of GrabFood. We weren’t expecting an influx of customers but with Grab, we now serve more customers than before,” said Jeff Uy and Jeff Sy, owners of 24 Chicken.  2019 is also the year Grab launched Grab for Good, a social impact program that aims to empower MSMEs and promote financial inclusion.  In a report they released last September,  9 million people in Southeast Asia are now using the platform to earn an income and grow their businesses. Alicia Laqi, owner of Sisig sa Rada, one of the Jolly Jeeps in Makati, said that GrabFood has helped her increase her revenue by allowing her to reach more people. “While the queue for my food already reaches far beyond a normal line, my revenues rose sharply because of the addition of GrabFood. It helped complement my already popular small stall and allowed me to earn more without adding a new branch,” she said.  Aside from providing jobs and helping microentrepreneurs expand their businesses, they’ve also started offering loans to driver-partners and MSMEs to help them grow their businesses or get them through emergency expenses.  Another innovation GrabFood is also proud of is the launch of GrabKitchen. GrabKitchen offers customers an on-demand delivery and in-store dining experience through a self-order kiosk. They offer users in a particular city a variety of food selections in one kitchen.  They opened a branch in Glorietta 2 and partnered with the following merchants: Omakase, Mister Kabab, 24 Chicken, Recovery Food, Frank and Dean, and CoCo Fresh Tea and Juice.  GrabKitchen helps MSMEs reach more clients without incurring additional costs. While cloud kitchens are usually delivery-only in nature, Grab Philippines added the dine-in experience knowing that Filipinos love to eat together and share their food.  Grab Philippines is also making waves through GrabPay. Now that customers can pay for their GrabFood deliveries, shopping items and groceries, bills and utilities, and more using the platform’s cashless payment method – the GrabPay wallet, more Filipinos are now ditching cash for a hassle-free transaction. For Jonathan Bates, head of GrabPay, this is their way of helping reduce the number of unbanked Filipinos or those who don’t have their own bank accounts.  Building on the idea of Grab being no longer just about transport, Bates, says that their goal in 2020 is to bring the convenience of cashless to as many Filipinos as possible. Thanks to their partnership with SM Investments Corporation (SMIC) and other partners, it has begun. Today, GrabPay can now be used to pay for GrabFood deliveries from over 10,000 restaurant partners, more than 5000  shopping, grocery and food outlets nationwide such as SM Stores, Starbucks and more, and pay for bills and utilities. Bates plans to make this platform available in cities outside the metro and eventually make Grab a 100% cashless app.  While Grab Philippines’ ambition has evolved, their passion to make an impact on communities remains the same.  With their expansion, Brian Cu, Grab Philippines president, recognizes the important role they play in addressing socio-economic challenges. May it be about championing financial literacy, giving safer transportation or offering additional income streams, he vows to help more Filipinos both living inside and outside Metro Manila thrive this 2020. For Cu, everyone can grow with Grab.   Cu and the rest of the executives of Grab Philippines are dedicated towards creating an impact by leveling the playing field and improving the quality of life for everyone. – Rappler.com   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/251019-npc-suspends-grab-selfie-audio-video-recording-systems/","title":"NPC suspends Grab’s selfie, audio, video recording systems","date":"Feb 5, 2020 11:05 AM PHT","snippet":"The National Privacy Commission says Grab 'did not sufficiently identify and assess the risks posed by these systems on the rights and freedoms' of its passengers","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The National Privacy Commission (NPC)  has suspended Grab Philippines’ selfie verification and pilot test of in-vehicle audio and video recording, saying this “may endanger the privacy rights” of the company’s passengers. The NPC said in a statement on Tuesday, February 5, that it “has issued a Cease and Desist Order (CDO) to Grab Philippines, Inc. (Grab PH) after finding deficiencies in complying with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (DPA) for three personal data processing systems, which may endanger the privacy rights of the riding public.” The systems: Grab earlier installed passenger verification via selfie as a security measure. If a passenger is unable to take a selfie, their identity may be verified by adding a credit/debit card. On January 13, Grab rolled out in-car audio and video recording as a measure to assist in incident prevention and dispute resolution. The pilot program was meant to run for 2 to 6 weeks with over 180 GrabCar vehicles, half of which are equipped with in-car cameras and half with audio-recording systems. According to Grab, passengers who booked cars involved in this pilot test would be notified in advance through GrabChat, and could opt to cancel the booking without penalty. The audio and video recordings would be encrypted and stored in Grab’s database for 7 days and 10 hours, respectively, only accessible by authorized Grab representatives in the event of an incident needing investigation.   Early reactions: On January 12, Grab user Ana Sanchez posted on Facebook that the GrabCar she was riding was equipped with audio recording, even without her explicit consent. She only noticed the sign 5 minutes into the ride.  “I did not stop the car midway, I just kept [quiet], in general, throughout the ride because I was uncomfortable at the thought of being recorded,” she told Rappler. {source} <iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmirensanchez%2Fposts%2F10158085234801204&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”669″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true” allow=”encrypted-media”></iframe> {/source} Sanchez reported her experience to the NPC for further investigation. According to Grab, no recording happened in this case since the pilot program started on January 13, and that the driver made the mistake of putting up the notice ahead of the pilot.  On January 14, the NPC announced that it had called on Grab to address the privacy concerns relating to the launch of their in-car audio and video recording systems. It issued a Notice of Deficiencies to Grab on January 31 after it “found several deficiencies” in the 3 systems. The deficiencies:  The NPC said on Wednesday that Grab “did not sufficiently identify and assess the risks posed by these systems on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.” “Only the risks faced by the company were taken into account” in its Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), the NPC said. The NPC notice also said that “the video recording system will also enable Grab employees to monitor the situation live from the Grab Office and take photos of what is happening inside the vehicle, once the driver prompts the office through an emergency button.” The NPC noted that the public was not informed about the collection and release mechanisms of the 3 systems – that these would be released upon request to police authorities in the event of a dispute, conflict, or complaint – through Grab’s privacy notice and privacy policy. The NPC noted that Grab “also failed to mention its legal basis in processing the collected data.” “The documents submitted to the NPC were also found to be insufficient to establish whether the company’s data processing was proportional to its intended purpose; whether the benefits of the processing outweigh the risks involved; nor whether the processing was the best among considered alternatives to achieve the underlying purpose,” it said. Moreover, the NPC found that the option to withdraw consent was not sufficiently communicated to passengers through GrabChat. “It was also unclear if and hor data processing will be affected upon such withdrawal of consent,” the NPC added. What happens next: Grab is required to comply with remedial measures within 15 days, as directed by the NPC. The suspension of the systems would be in place until the company addresses the deficiencies. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/250038-grabfood-expansion-iloilo-city/","title":"GrabFood expands to Iloilo","date":"Jan 23, 2020 4:46 PM PHT","snippet":"The GrabFood expansion to Iloilo comes right on time for the city's Dinagyang Festival","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Iloilo City is the newest addition to the GrabFood network.

The fare is cheap. It would only take a total of P25 for her to travel from her office in Urdaneta Village in Makati City to her home in San Juan City – but that’s the case only if she’s willing to spend more than an hour stuck in EDSA and another 30-minute jeepney ride to their house. She’s not. “Alam mo [ang] traffic sa Makati, hindi uubra ang normal commute. Sayang oras mo,” Impat told Rappler. (You how the traffic is in Makati. Your normal commute won’t do. Your time is wasted.) As a new mom, Impat started using the pioneer motorcycle taxi app Angkas to book trips, even if that meant a higher fare. By booking a motorcycle taxi, her commute time is now down to 30 minutes. “Before kasi umuuwi ako ng San Juan or Antipolo, super traffic ‘pag rush hour. And being a mom, gusto ko mabilis makauwi sa baby ko for quality time, kahit ‘yung pamasahe is P25, if naka-Angkas ako, P150 to P170 depende sa surge,” Impat said. (Before, whenever I go home to San Juan or Antipolo, traffic is heavy during rush hour. And being a mom, I want to get home immediately to spend quality time with my baby, even if that increases fare from just P25 to, if I would choose Angkas, around P150 to P170, depending on the surge rate.) Ana Lubiano, 25, is another regular user of motorcycle taxis. She found it as a cheaper option than other ride-hailing services such as Grab. “Kaya talaga ako gumagamit ng Angkas is to beat traffic, lalo na ‘pag nakikita ko na malala na ‘yung traffic. Mase-save ka talaga ‘nya para hindi ka ma-late, kasi nga motor. So p’wedeng sumingit-singit, hindi katulad if naka-4 wheels, ka stuck ka na – stress ka pa talaga – sa traffic,” Lubiano said. (The reason why I’m using apps like Angkas is to beat traffic, especially when I see that traffic congestion is bad. It will really save you so that you won’t be late because you’re using a motorcycle. Motorcycles can cut in between vehicles, unlike 4-wheeled cars that can get you stuck – and stressed – in traffic.) Whenever she finds it hard to book a ride on Angkas, which is usually the case now since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) imposed a 10,000-rider cap per firm, Lubiano would “book” habal-habal on Facebook. “‘Pag mahirap mag-book and walang available na Angkas within the area, no choice na kundi ‘yung sa FB group or mga Habal sa daan,” Lubiano said. (When it’s hard to book and there’s no available Angkas within the area, I don’t have a choice but book on Facebook or hail one on the streets.) Mobility as service The prospects of a “dignified commute” in Metro Manila seem bleak in the short term, as the population growth rate continues to accelerate to a point that is beyond the current public transportation’s capacity. According to a report by Bloomberg, driving a kilometer in Metro Manila has worsened in 2019. In September 2019, data from navigation app Waze showed that it took an average of 5 minutes per kilometer to travel around Metro Manila, longer than the April record of 3.8 minutes per kilometer. The population outlook for Metro Manila is not seen to decrease in the coming years either, as a United Nation report in 2018 showed that the metropolis is projected to have an annual increase of 1.9% in the next decade. Because of heavier traffic in cities, “mobility as a service” has been on the rise to provide an alternative mode of transportation that is faster than current options, according to a 2017 report by United Kingdom-based financial consultancy firm Deloitte. “Mobility as a service” is a model taken on by ride-hailing apps Grab and Uber, and the new motorcycle taxi firms JoyRide and MoveIt, along with Angkas. While more Filipino commuters shift to motorcycle taxis as their preferred mode of transportation because of its ability to “beat traffic,” the motorcycle-hailing industry may hit a dead-end, pending the passage of a law that would allow its permanent operations. The long and winding road to legalization As early as 2017, the government led the crackdown on motorcycle-hailing services of Angkas because it is illegal. (READ: Angkas-like: Motorcycle taxis in Southeast Asia hit bumpy road toward gov’t recognition)   But even then, underground habal-habal operations were already widespread, it’s just that Angkas was able to train the bikers to drive more safely. Romeo Maglunsod, who used to be a habal-habal driver before joining Angkas, said this in one of the public consultation hearings at the LTFRB in 2017. The point is to regulate instead of turning a blind eye, Maglunsod said. Under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, which was enacted 55 years ago, motorcycles can only be registered as private or government vehicles. Therefore, it can’t be used by its owners to carry passengers and be paid for it. In the 17th Congress, bills amending the Land Transportation and Traffic Code was tackled by the House of Representatives and the Senate. House lawmakers passed their version of the bill in February 2019, but it remained pending under the Senate committee on public services, which Senator Grace Poe headed. In one of the Senate hearings in 2019, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto urged the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to just issue a department order to allow motorcycle taxis to operate, just like what it did with Grab and Uber (when the latter was still here). Arguing that legislation is the way to go, the DOTr started the 6-month pilot run, which was extended by 3 months to March 23, 2020. The point of this pilot implementation is to “collect” data that may be used by lawmakers when crafting the bill. However, on Monday, January 20, the inter-agency technical working group overseeing the test run terminated it – more than two months earlier than end of the extension period. The announcement was made just as Senate committee on public services was about to start its hearing on the matter. Proposals In the 18th Congress, there are at least 4 bills in the Senate and 14 bills in the House of Representatives seeking to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. All of these carry more or less the same language: {source} <blockquote style=”border-left: 5px solid #FFD700;“> Section 7. Registration Classification. Every motor vehicle shall be registered under one of the following prescribed classifications: (a) XXX (b) XXX (c) XXX … (j) XXX and (k) motorcycles-for-hire. </blockquote> {/source} At the Senate, Poe, Recto, and senators Juan Edgardo Angara and Imee Marcos have filed separate proposals to legalize motorcycle taxis. Poe and Recto propose that motorcycles-for-hire must be less than 1,000 kilograms in weight, can travel more than 50 kilometers per hour, and has an engine capacity of 125 cubic centimeters. In the proposals of Poe, Angara, and Marcos, government regulators would be mandated to ensure the roadworthiness of motorcycle taxis before registration. No modification shall be made apart from the luggage carrier at the back, a saddlebag, a foot peg, and appropriate speed limiter and monitoring devices. In Poe’s bill, there is a section on fare setting, specifically saying that LTFRB should “determine, prescribe, approve, and periodically review and adjust” reasonable fares for the operation of motorcycle taxi services. Meanwhile, Marcos, in her proposal, “urges” local government units (LGUs) to issue guidelines for the operations of motorcycle taxis in their jurisdictions. She also proposed that the Land Transportation Office require insurance for passengers and cargo. Similar measures have been filed by Muntilupa Representative Ruffy Biazon, Batangas 6th District Representative Vilma Santos-Recto, Quezon City 2nd District Representative Pecious Castelo, and Quezon City 5th District Representative Alfred Vargas. Meanwhile, majority of the bills in the House of Representatives include the proposal for motorcycles-for-hire to only be allowed “for a limited period, with limited number of units and in specific routes only,” which should be determined by the DOTr and the LTFRB, in coordination with LGUs. At least 11 congressmen argue that the transportation department should give priority to higher-capacity vehicles or mass transit sytems. This specific measures have been separately filed by Makati City Representative Romulo Peña Jr, Ilocos Norte 2nd District Representative Angelo Barba, Kabayan Representative Ron Salo, South Cotabato 2nd District Representative Ferdinand Hernandez, Cagayan de Oro City 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez, Bohol 1st District Representative Edgar Chatto, Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Luis Villafuerte, Cebu City 1st District Representative Raul del Mar, the late LPGMA Representative Rodolfo Albano III, and Isabela 1st District Representative Antonio Albano, and Quezon City 6th District Representative Tyrone Agabas. Instead of adding another classification specific to motorcycles-for-hire, Makati City 2nd District Representative Luis Campos’ bill proposes to amend Section 7 (c) of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code to allow the registration of motorcycles “either as private or public utility vehicle.” ‘It’s needed’ As traffic congestion worsens, Impat and Lubiano said it’s even more important for lawmakers to pass a bill that would allow commuters like them to have options to beat traffic, save their time, and use it somewhere else. “[Motorcycle taxis like] Angkas helps commuters to beat the traffic, especially in Metro Manila. I can say, they can be considered as part of the solution,” Lubiano told Rappler in a mix of English and Filipino. “Regulations lang din [kailangan] kasi sa super traffic ngayon. Heaven-sent ‘yung may option ka na mas mapabilis ‘yung travel time mo, given na ‘pag rush hour talagang almost two hours ang b’yahe na ‘pag sa Angkas 30 minutes mo lang makukuha,” Impat said. (Authorities only need to regulate them. Because of the heavy traffic nowadays, it’s heaven-sent to have an option that would make your travel faster, especially during rush hour when you would have to spent almost two hours, but which an Angkas ride can shorten to 30 minutes.) Public Works Secretary Mark Villar says some road projects will be done by 2020, removing private car volume along main roads. But in terms of public commute, majority of big-ticket railway projects are set to be in partial operations only by the end of the Duterte administration or in 2022. However, if commuters are to escape horrors of current state of public transportation between now and 2022, lawmakers will need to make motorcyle taxis stay on the streets – legally. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/248735-angkas-like-motorcycle-taxis-southeast-asia-bumpy-road-government-recognition/","title":"Angkas-like: Motorcycle taxis in Southeast Asia hit bumpy road toward gov’t recognition","date":"Jan 10, 2020 11:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Like Angkas in the Philippines, app-based services in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia want their governments to recognize motorcycles as official modes of transportation","body":" MANILA, Philippines – With its launch in 2016, motorcycle taxi service Angkas offered an alternative method of transportation so commuters could glide through Metro Manila and Cebu traffic at the tap of a button. The app-based ride-hailing service was bound to become popular in cities where commuters spend hours in traffic jam every day. Under Philippine laws, however, Angkas’ status remains illegal. Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code provides that motorcycles can only be private or government vehicles. Private vehicles cannot be used for hire, while government vehicles can only be used in fulfilling government functions. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) With 9 pending bills in Congress seeking to recognize motorcycle taxis, the technical working group (TWG) set strict and specific guidelines on Angkas’ operations during the pilot run to ensure commuters’ safety. While Angkas maintained a 99.997% safety rate, new players JoyRide and Move It have yet to show similar statistics. (READ: Metro commuting in 2019: The shortcomings of the motorcycle taxi pilot run) In neighboring countries of Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, motorcycle taxis started as an informal sector and evolved into ride-hailing apps-based service that received government attention and regulation. This is how Angkas-like services operate in other Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia Ojeks, or motorcycle taxis, existed in Indonesia for many years prior to the rise of ride-hailing apps. Similar to the Philippines’ habal-habal system, ojeks were an informal means for moving people around the city. Commuters would look for an ojek shelter or hail for them wherever they could find them. Some lucky commuters developed rapport with drivers to service them regularly. Indonesia’s ride-hailing startup Gojek traces its roots back to 2010 as a motorcycle ride-hailing call center, where the company would match calling customers with ojeks.  The practice was in a gray area – no existing legal framework or regulation, but still done. For a while, the government was silent on ojeks, with no impetus to go after them since it was understood that they provided a necessary service in a city always snarled by traffic. In 2015, the Gojek app was launched as it began to expand its services beyond motorcycle taxis. Grab entered the picture in 2012. The two apps generated wide popularity as millions in investments poured in. When the apps came, the ojek system had somewhat been formalized, and that’s when the government stepped in. The Indonesian Ministry of Transportation announced in January 2019 that they had begun working to regulate fares. They understood that the mere presence of these motorcycle services needed regulation even without official government recognition. The 2009 Traffic and Land Transportation Law does not recognize two-wheeled vehicles as a public transport mode. A petition by 54 drivers to amend the law was junked by the Constitutional Court in 2018. The ministry released an ojek regulation in March 2019, with provisions on standard fares and customer safety. A ministry officer said  they would arrange meetings with Gojek and Grab to discuss minimum fares. The regulation requires drivers to wear uniforms, have valid drivers’ licenses, have adequate knowledge of street routes, and follow traffic rules. Ride-hailing companies are also required to have an emergency button and accident compensation. There are also procedures for hiring and suspending drivers. The ride-hailing companies still receive complaints and protests over their services, but there reportedly has not been much noise with regards to the government’s regulation. Thailand Ride-hailing companies have been operating in Thailand for several years. Among them is Get, a unit of Indonesia’s Gojek, that offers motorcycle taxi rides. Thailand deals with an unregulated market. An earlier form of motorcycle taxi service was called motosai, where drivers were managed by an informal operator that would provide their uniforms for a fee.  In 2014, the military government attempted to regulate the business by making the drivers buy their uniforms directly from the Thai Department of Transport. The arrival of similar services by Uber and Grab later on threatened this arrangement. Thailand suspended motorcycle taxi services from Uber and Grab in 2016, with reports saying at least 66 drivers from the companies were arrested. The actions were done on claims they “broke local rules” and were “clashing with registered transport companies.” The crackdown came 3 months after Uber launched its motorcycle taxi service in Bangkok. The Transport Ministry announced in September 2019 that it was drafting guidelines to regulate ride-hailing companies.  Currently, police reportedly stop and fine drivers for improper registration. Reports of violence among motor taxi drivers have come about amid the arrival of ride-hailing apps. “We have to look at what is possible within the law to give choice to the public – not increase competition with taxis in the system,” Transport Ministry Deputy Permanent Secretary Jirut Wisarnjit told Reuters. The regulatory framework is targeted for finalization by March 2020. Malaysia Local startup Dego Ride was the first of its kind in Malaysia, starting motorcycle taxi operations in the country in late 2016. The government quickly declared it illegal in January 2017 due to safety concerns.  Malaysian political coalition Pakatan Harapan’s Transport Minister Anthony Loke upheld the decision in September 2018, saying high motorcycle accident rates were enough reason to not legalize the services. Taxi company founder Shamsubahrin Ismail also brought up cultural factors that may show motor taxis to be problematic, asking if women passengers hugging riders would be acceptable. In August 2019, Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq lobbied with the Malaysian Cabinet to approve legalizing the service. Saddiq arranged for Loke, Gojek founder Nadiem Makarim, and the Prime Minister himself to be at the meeting. Malaysia’s The Star reported that Saddiq pitched to create youth employment through motorcycle taxi services, in line with a Pakatan election promise of creating one million job opportunities.  The Malaysian Cabinet then allowed the introduction of motorcycle taxi services in the country, subject to viability studies and legal provisions. Saddiq later met with Dego Ride after excluding the homegrown startup from the previous meeting and ensuring that the Cabinet’s approval would be applicable to all motorcycle taxi apps, not just Gojek. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/248768-game-results-trail-blazers-raptors-january-7-2020/","title":"Vintage Melo grabs winner as Blazers stun Raptors","date":"Jan 8, 2020 12:02 PM PHT","snippet":"Carmelo Anthony knocks in the game-clincher as the Trail Blazers rally from a double-digit deficit against the defending champions","body":"   LOS ANGELES, USA – Carmelo Anthony rolled back the years with 28 points and a last-gasp winner as the Portland Trail Blazers upset the Toronto Raptors, 101-99, in the NBA on Tuesday, January 7 (Wednesday, January 8, Philippine time).

There are some that will get below a peso, there are others who will get over a hundred pesos,” Cu said Grab Philippines said that there were 3.2 million riders from February to May 2019, the time period covered by the penalties. Miguel Aguila, lead legal counsel of Grab Philippnines, said that the amount each rider will get will be “proportionate” to the amount that they spent during that time period.  “If you are a rider [who] spent P1,000, you should get 10 times more than a rider who just paid for P100. So as much as possible we want it to be proportionate,” Aguila said in a mix of Filipino and English. The PCC had ordered Grab to refund P5.05 million to its riders as the company had breached its pricing commitments to the government agency. Grab  had said that it looked forward to paying its passengers, and will announce the mechanics at least 5 days before the refund. Cu said on Friday that the payment will be sourced from the company’s contingency funds. He also emphasized that drivers will not be affected by the fines. Cu also maintained that there was “no overcharging,” saying that the company was compliant with the fare matrix of the LTFRB. “Walang overcharging na nangyari (No overcharging happened). So even if we disclose to consumers how we charge, which we do in the receipt, sang-ayon naman ‘to sa fare matrix ng [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board] (It is compliant with the fare matrix of the LTFRB),” Cu said. Cu cited “uncontrollable factors” such as booking demand, traffic conditions and the supply of transport network vehicle services, that kept them from maintaining the fare range imposed by the PCC. The refund procedures have yet to be announced. The guidelines will be available in Grab’s mobile app and social media platforms 5 days before the refund. Aguila said the refund could be released by December. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/profiles-and-advocacies/245227-grabfood-celebrates-first-anniversary-growth-merchant-partners/","title":"GrabFood celebrates first anniversary in PH by highlighting growth of merchant-partners","date":"Nov 19, 2019 2:44 PM PHT","snippet":"For Grabfood, success isn't measured by numbers alone. It’s equally important to consider the impact it has brought to the lives of their fellow Filipinos.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In celebration of their first anniversary in the Philippines, GrabFood invited the press at the Zuellig building in Makati last November 14 to share exciting trends, goals, and growth of their merchant-partners.  Since launching GrabFood in November 2018, they were able to reach 35 locations nationwide with major partners such as McDonald’s, KFC, Pizza Hut, Bon Chon, The Max’s Group, and Jollibee Food Corporation. They also became a trusted food delivery service for small and medium enterprises like Jollijeeps.  In a market survey conducted by Kantar, a global market research firm, 76% of Filipino consumers said that GrabFood is their most often used food delivery platform.  These milestones have inspired the team behind this food delivery service to amp up their efforts to help more Filipinos.  “At Grab, we recognize that success isn’t measured by numbers alone, but by the impact it has brought to the lives of our fellow Filipinos,” said EJ Dela Vega, GrabFood Philippines Head. So, they held their first Golden Lunchbox Award last October, a recognition given to GrabFood’s consumers, merchant-partners, and delivery partners with the most outstanding performance and breakthrough growth.  “At the end of the day, we are fueled by our mission to elevate the lives of Filipinos and empower them to grow with Grab,” said Dela Vega.  Breakthrough merchants Sisig sa Rada, a micro enterprise owned by Alicia Laqi has already reached more than P2 million in sales from GrabFood delivery alone. “While the queue for my food already reaches far beyond a normal line, my revenues rose sharply because of the addition of GrabFood. It helped complement my already popular, small stall and allowed me to earn more without adding a new branch,” she said.  24 Chicken, a Korean fried chicken joint has tripled its sales, allowing it to expand to 8 branches as demand for its tasty food grew rapidly after they partnered with GrabFood for delivery services. “We weren’t expecting an influx of customers, but with Grab we now serve more customers than before,” owner Jeff Sy said.   Another merchant success story is that of Empanada Nation which saw its business grow by as much as 5x and is now targeting to end 2019 with 11 branches after GrabFood helped them drive new demand for their products.  Kanto Freestyle, a restaurant that offers eaters with lutong-bahay meals found that GrabFood is an integral part of their business plan because of the value that it drives for the company. “Before, whenever we plan to open a new branch to expand, we usually just look into the viability of the community, but now, we are looking at who we’ll reach through the delivery service. It changed our decision-making in expansion,” said Paul Cruz, marketing and social media manager for Kanto Freestyle.   It’s not just the merchants who have benefitted from GrabFood’s services. Albert Orea, who was awarded Top GrabFood Delivery-Partner said that GrabFood changed his life. “Dati po akong fish dealer. Ang kinikita ko po sa pagtitinda, P2000, P1500. Pero mas malaki pa yung pautang kaya hindi po namin lagi na-re-remit yung pera sa pagtitinda ng isda,” he said. Now that he’s with Grab, he’s now capable of sending his children to private schools. “Naging healthy rin po ako. Ang pangangatawan ko po laging handa mag rides para sa mga customers (I became healthy. My body’s always ready to drive for my customers).”  GrabFood aims to continue the growth of the food delivery industry in the Philippines by expanding in at least 10 more cities. They’ll also start introducing the option to deliver via bicycle and a runner on foot.  “GrabFood commits to the growth of the food delivery industry in the Philippines. The impact we’ve created to our community of consumers, delivery partners, and merchant partners have inspired us to grow and serve them more,” Dela Vega said. – Rappler.com  To celebrate their first anniversary, GrabFood is holding their biggest online feast called ‘One Big Handaan’. They’ll be giving away free supply of GrabFood vouchers for a year, daily merchant deals, happy hour offers, and a special P1 delivery from November 15 to December 6.     "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/245181-philippine-competition-commission-orders-grab-refund-riders/","title":"Antitrust body orders Grab to refund P5M to riders","date":"Nov 18, 2019 1:05 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The new disgorgement mechanism will require Grab to refund any excess fares to riders through their GrabPay accounts","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) ordered Grab Philippines to refund an amount of P5.05 million to its riders for breaches in its pricing commitments. In a press conference on Monday, November 18, the PCC said that, during the period of February to May 2019, Grab exceeded the allowable deviation from before its merger with Uber. This means that the increase of Grab fares from before its acquisition of Uber to its current operations exceeded by more than 22%, under its old set of voluntary pricing commitments to the PCC. This violation incurred a P5.05-million penalty. The PCC amended its conditions so that Grab will refund the penalty to its riders instead of paying it to the antitrust authority. In the new round of monitoring, a 22.5% allowable fare deviation has been imposed on Grab. Riders can check if Grab is breaching its pricing commitments by comparing what they were paying before March 2018 to the fares they are paying now, checking if the increase is more than 22.5%. Should Grab breach this deviation, the company will have to pay P2 million to the PCC as well as refund any penalties to riders within 30 days. According to PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan, riders will directly be given a rebate through their individual GrabPay accounts.  For the current P5.05-million penalty, Grab can file a motion for reconsideration within 15 days, and the PCC will be allowed 30 days to submit a final resolution. After this period, Grab is required to refund the amount to its riders within 60 days. This measure is in line with a newly-approved disgorgement mechanism that will take effect on the second year of PCC’s monitoring of Grab operations, to prevent the company from having a “virtual monopoly” on the ride-hailing market. PCC Commissioner Amabelle Asuncion reiterated that only the recipient of the penalty payment has changed, not the formula for computing the penalties. In a statement, Grab said it “looked forward” to paying the passengers who took Grab rides during February to May 2019. Further, the company maintained it complies with the fare matrix imposed by the Land Transportation Regulatory and Franchising Board (LTFRB). Grab will announce the payment mechanics to the riders at least 5 days prior to paying. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/announcements/244969-grabfood-food-sale-feast-2019/","title":"GrabFood celebrates 1st anniversary in the Philippines with ‘One Big Handaan’ – the biggest online feast of 2019","date":"Nov 15, 2019 11:09 AM PHT","snippet":"Promos include P1 delivery, 40% discounts, P111 vouchers, special merchant deals, and flash sales","body":" [Editor’s note: GrabFood is giving away exciting promos to celebrate their first anniversary in the Philippines today.

For the top executives of Rustan’s Beauty, it was a question of how soon. The brand’s hero product, after all, is one that’s essential to any Filipino who’s into makeup because the kilay, truly, is life. On Tuesday, November 12, the brand officially opened its first permanent kiosk in the Philippines on the ground floor of the Rustan’s department store in Makati. In case you didn’t already know, Anastasia Beverly Hills is a cosmetics brand founded by Anastasia Soare. First renowned for its brow products, the “prosumer” line has since expanded to complexion and lip products.  While the brand has long been available to Philippine consumers through e-commerce platforms, the Rustan’s Makati kiosk is the first permanent physical spot where both loyal users and curious beauty mavers can swatch and even try on their products.  Here’s what you can expect to see at the first Anastasia kiosk in the Philippines:   TOP PICK: All the eyeshadow palettes. While their brow products are what first grabbed their loyal clients’ attention, their eyeshadow formula has certainly not disappointed. The Soft Glam or the Modern Renaissance palettes (P2950) are perfect for those who are just starting out or aren’t so daring when it comes to eye looks. Warm browns, golds, and peaches abound in Soft Glam while pinks and peaches are king in the Modern Renaissance palette.   If you’re in for something a little more dramatic, go for the colorful Norvina palette or the vampy Sultry palette.  So far, only the Soft Glam, Modern Renaissance, and Norvina palettes are in stock, but we’re told the Sultry palette and another collaboration palette will be in stock before the year ends. A little goes a very, very long way for ABH eyeshadow – don’t dig in too hard or you’ll get kick-up (a beauty blogger term for when the powder gets everywhere after you tap it with a brush) or deposit way too much pigment on the lid. Their shadows are very pigmented and blend easily as long as you use them with a light hand.  All palettes retail for P2950.  If you’re more into customizing your own eyeshadow palette, individual eyeshadows sell for P800 each. You also purchase a plastic palette (P595) to house your custom mix.  ABH also has a waterproof creme color in jet matte (P1,200), eye primers (P1200 and P1050), waterproof liner (P1200), and a liquid liner (P1250).   Snatched and more. Listen, we all want that defined face, but not everyone is gifted with a jawline that can cut through steel or cheekbones that bring you closer to heaven. Thankfully, we’ve got contour and higlight powders to fix that.  Anastasia sells an all-in-one powder contour kit (P2800) that contains 3 higlighter and 3 contour shades. If you already know what your shades are, you can pick between the powder bronzer (P2000) or the stick contour (P1800). Is highlight not enough?  Glow from as far away as the next kanto with their highlighting products. The glow kit (P2800), which comes in 3 variants, contain well-milled pressed powder highlighters that’ll make sure the spotlight is on your high points. If liquid highlight is more your jam, there’s the liquid glow (P1800), which also comes in 3 shades.  If you’re looking for a new blush shade (because who isn’t), there are 3 shades of blush trios (P2100) to choose from.  ALL ABOUT THE BASE. Base products are a relatively new addition to the ABH lineup and luckily, you can swatch and test all you can at the kiosk.   You can pick from 16 shades of the Luminous Foundation (P2800) to see which shades match you the best. Store clerks can help you figure out your undertones as well. Finally, seal your look with loose setting powders (P2500) and the dewy set setting spray (P1750). If the foundation isn’t glowy enough, start with the hydrating oil (P3300) as your base.  LIP PICKS. The beauty of a kiosk for, well, beauty products is that you can play around with a product before handing over your precious, hard-earned cash in the name of the beauty gods. You also chance upon products you never thought you’d like. In my case, it was the liquid lipstick (P1400). You barely need a swipe for coverage that doesn’t cake, crase, or crack. The wand also makes application a breeze even without lip liner.   Their lipglosses (P1150) are also a treat – they’re creamy and sticky enough to make sure they don’t disappear right after application but not too sticky to make them a hassle to use. ABH also has matte lipsticks (P1200) and a lip primer (P1150). I’d recommend any lip balm prior to using their liquid lipsticks or matte lipsticks – just make sure you wipe it off before you put on a lip primer.  TOP PICK: Brow-wows. You can never really go wrong when it comes to any of their brow products. Anastasia, after all, first shot to fame for her “Golden Ratio Eyebrow Shaping Method” which have led to the brows of many Hollywood bigshots.   Here’s the list of all the brow products currently available at the kiosk in Rustan’s Makati:  Brow Gel (clear) – P1550Tinted Brow Gel – P1550Dipbrow Gel – P1150 Dipbrow Pomade – P1300Brow Wiz – P1550 Brow Definer – P1650 Perfect Brow Pencil – P1650 Brow Powder Duo – P1650 Brow Pro Palette – P5450 Highlighting Duo Pencil – P1650 Pro Pencil – P1250 Brow Primer – P1500Brow Stencils – P1400Tweezers – P1950 Scissors – P1550 ABH, admittedly, isn’t cheap so here are a few tips if you don’t know which products to pick. If you’re into the dramatic brow, the classic dipbrow is a must-have. Apply heavily for brows that will not, do not, and cannot budge, or use a light hand for a barely-there coverage. If you’re skilled enough, you can apply these in hair-like strokes and everyone will think you had microblading done.  If your brow is already in tip-top shape, go for the dipbrow gel, the tinted brow gel, or the clear brow gel. The first option gives the most coverage (and color) while the latter two will help you get the most natural kind of brow.  Of course, there’s no sleeping on the brow wiz, ABH’s most popular brow product. The thin tip – among the first of its kind in the beauty world – guarantee hair-like strokes even for the most basic of users. If you want a more fool-proof application, the brow definer is the way to go.  Pros (and semi-pros) would love playing around with the brow pro palette – the shade combinations are limitless.  ABH also sells an angled brush (P1300) for its brow products, but based on experience, any angled brush with a tip narrow and stiff enough works just as well. Rustan’s also has plans of opening ABH kiosks in other locations soon. – Rappler.com Ready for some serious makeup shopping?

The Spaniard pulled out of last week’s Paris Masters at the semi-final stage and is nursing an abdominal strain as he gears up for his first match on Monday, November 11.  Nadal, who has never won the ATP Finals despite his trophy-laden career, dethroned Djokovic from the top of the rankings this week. The 33-year-old said he was happy to be in London after being forced to pull out of Paris but admitted he was not serving at full tilt. “I need to see how things evolve every single day,” he said. “I have good hopes to be 100% ready for Monday.” The Spanish top seed said he had only started practicing his serving on Thursday, November 7 and it had been “very slow”. “For me the main goal is to be healthy for Monday more than to have a huge amount of services,” he added. Nadal, who won the French Open and US Open this year, said he had been happy with his form before his injury. “I’m confident that I can be very competitive but of course it’s a tournament that you will face the top guys from the beginning so you need to be 100% ready. “I really hope that I will be able to serve every single day better.” Nadal’s opponents in the Andre Agassi group are Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev. His first match is on Monday against defending champion Zverev. The Bjorn Bjorg group features Djokovic, Roger Federer, Dominic Thiem and Matteo Berrettini.

The 16-time Grand Slam champion captured his fifth Paris Masters title on Sunday, November 4, with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Denis Shapovalov, but will be usurped by the injured Rafael Nadal at the top of the rankings on Monday. Nadal said he will fight until it is “impossible” to be fit for the start of the season-ending championships on November 10. If the Spaniard does not play or fails to win a round-robin match at the Finals, Djokovic must claim two group-stage victories and make the final to pass him. Djokovic would also be sure of the year-end top ranking should he win the tournament and Nadal does not reach the semifinals. “There’s always a chance that I win all my matches in London, that I play well. I have done it in the past, and I like playing there,” said the 32-year-old, who has won 5 ATP Finals titles. “But it’s [an] extremely difficult task considering who my opponents are going to be.” “You’re playing [a] top 10 player every single match. So that’s a big task on my end that I have to focus on.” “And as a consequence, of course, if I manage to get the year-end No. 1, that would be fantastic.” Djokovic is bidding to equal Pete Sampras’ record of finishing 6 years as the world’s best player, while Nadal is looking to achieve the feat for the fifth time. “It is a motivation and a goal every day,” said Djokovic. “It is a goal that I have as a professional tennis player to win as many Grand Slams as possible and also to be No. 1 worldwide for as long as possible.” The 33-year-old Nadal could have ended the race for top spot by winning the Paris title, but he withdrew before his semifinal against Shapovalov with an abdominal muscle strain. Djokovic not slowing down Djokovic has enjoyed yet another fantastic season, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon among his 5 titles. That looked a long way off when his comeback from a long-standing elbow injury suffered a setback last year with a shock French Open quarterfinal defeat by Italian Marco Cecchinato. But he has since added 5 major titles, having also claimed the 2018 Wimbledon and US Open crowns. Djokovic – who is closing in on Nadal, who has 19, and Federer, with 20, on the all-time list of Grand Slam titles – says he is hoping to play on for as many years as possible. “I would like to play tennis for a long time. I don’t know how long that is going to be, but I wish to really play pretty long.” “So hopefully you’ll be seeing me around for many more years.” Djokovic’s victory on Sunday delivered his 34th Masters title and his 77th on the ATP Tour in total. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/243400-singapore-restaurant-grab-a-crab-machine-sparks-uproar/","title":"Singapore restaurant ‘grab-a-crab’ machine sparks uproar","date":"Oct 25, 2019 6:27 PM PHT","snippet":"House of Seafood's promotional stunt lets customers use an arcade-style claw machine to catch live crabs to be cooked on the spot","body":" SINGAPORE, Singapore – A Singapore restaurant Thursday, October 24 suspended a bizarre promotional stunt where customers use an arcade-style machine with a mechanical claw to catch live crabs after it sparked uproar online. A video of the pink machine, containing the creatures and emblazoned with a picture of a smiling red crab under the phrase “Come and catch me”, went viral after being posted this week. Similar to machines where people pick up soft toys, the game sees customers pay Sg$5 ($3.7) to use a joystick to move the claw over the creatures before lowering it to try to grab one. If successful, the customer can have the Sri Lankan crab cooked on the spot free of charge, choose to take it home, or leave it at the House of Seafood restaurant to eat another time. But internet users condemned the game as cruel after the specially produced video promoting it went online. “This is too much,” Joseph Soh wrote on Facebook. “Why are you making their remaining life even more difficult… Absolutely disgusting.” The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said the machine “causes unnecessary harm to the animals and it also encourages people to see animals as nothing more than objects to play with”. “Crabs are living creatures, not toys,” it added. The government’s Animal and Veterinary Service said it was alerted to the case and was investigating. House of Seafood chief executive Francis Ng told AFP the promotion, which began this month, had been suspended after the outcry – but added he was surprised at the reaction. “People think I torture them but we don’t have any intention of doing that,” he said. “The crabs are not being hurt.” The claw is covered with plastic and the area inside is cushioned to prevent injury if the creatures are dropped, added Ng, who also posted an apology on the restaurant chain’s Facebook page. Ng said a similar promotion at two restaurants he operates in China was a success. He plans to meet with Singapore authorities and will cease using the machine permanently if ordered. Restaurants across Asia often keep live seafood in tanks for diners to pick out for their meals. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/241691-malaysia-threatens-grab-multimillion-dollar-fine/","title":"Malaysia threatens Grab with $21-million fine","date":"Oct 3, 2019 5:05 PM PHT","snippet":"The Malaysia Competition Commission proposes fining Grab almost 87 million ringgit ($21 million) for preventing its drivers from providing advertising services for the company's competitors","body":" KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – Malaysia’s competition watchdog on Thursday, October 3, threatened to hit Grab with a $21-million fine for practices that allegedly reduce competition, the latest problem for the ride-hailing giant. Grab is the biggest ride-hailing firm in Southeast Asia, and has strengthened its hold on the market since buying US rival Uber’s operations in the region last year.  But the Singapore-headquartered firm has come under scrutiny from regulators in several countries due to concerns about its dominant position.  The Malaysia Competition Commission proposed fining Grab almost 87 million ringgit ($21 million) for preventing its drivers from providing advertising services for the company’s competitors. This had the effect of “distorting competition” by creating barriers to Grab’s rivals, it said. “It is important that barriers to entry for new players remain low, and for existing players to have the ability to grow and compete on merits to ensure that competition can remain healthy,” said Iskandar Ismail, the watchdog’s chief executive. In addition, a daily penalty of 15,000 ringgit will be imposed should Grab fail to take action to address the competition concerns. Grab has 30 days to respond to the watchdog, after which a final decision will be made. The company said they had complied fully with competition laws and were “surprised” by the proposed fine. “We believe that it is common practice for businesses to decide upon the availability and type of third-party advertising on their respective platforms,” a Grab statement said. Last year, Singapore fined Grab and Uber $9.5 million for breaking competition rules when they merged. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/241573-ltfrb-surprised-crash-victim-did-not-receive-aid-from-grab/","title":"Grab crash victim: I have not received any financial aid","date":"Oct 2, 2019 4:46 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Grab denies this allegation, showing a check for around P166,000, which it issued and was received by the victim's uncle","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Three years after riding a Grab taxi that was involved in a collision – claiming the life of her best friend and severely injuring her – Karen Graneta said she had not received a single peso of financial assistance from the ride-hailing company. Graneta narrated the events of that ill-fated day during the Senate committee for public services hearing on Wednesday, October 2, regarding the Philippine Day of Remembrance for Road Crash Victims, Survivors, and Families. Grab denied this allegation two days later, showing the media on Friday, October 4, a photo of the check they issued to help with Graneta’s expenses.  At the Senate hearing Wednesday, Graneta said the accident occurred on September 27, 2016 at Nagtahan (now Mabini) bridge when 3 trucks collided with the Grab taxi that she and her best friend were riding in. They were trapped inside the car for almost an hour, leading to the death of her best friend. Meanwhile, Graneta was hospitalized for 6 months, undergoing 4 operations in the first 5 months. Graneta said she had aspent more than P3 million for her medical expenses. All throughout her ordeal she never received any financial assistance from Grab. “Talagang nagpapakahirap po kaming maghanap kasi syempre hindi naman po kami ganun kayaman para magkaroon ng ganyan kalaking amount (We’re really struggling because we don’t have that kind of money),” she said. ‘We were told assistance was extended’ Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chairman Martin Delgra III was surprised by this revelation, saying they were told that assistance was extended after the crash. “I’ll have to take it up with Grab as to what happened with this incident,” he said. Delgra said they followed protocol after the accident and told Grab to assist the victim immediately regardless of who was at fault. He added that they issued a show-cause order to Grab because even if the taxi driver was not at fault, it was still a public utility vehicle that has obligations to its passengers. As per LTFRB regulations, a passenger is entitled to an insurance coverage of P100,000 for injuries.  Senator Grace Poe said she would also follow up with Grab regarding the incident. The committee on public services, which Poe heads, is lobbying for the creation of  a National Transportation Safety Board that would probe crash incidents.  On Friday, October 4, Grab denied Graneta’s allegation, saying their representative personally visited Graneta’s family to know how they could be of assistance and that they had issued a check worth around P166,000 to Graneta’s uncle, Roel Capuno. Graneta on Monday, October 7, refuted this, saying the money her family received came from an organization of taxi drivers, but she refused to give anymore details, as advised by her lawyers.  The ride-hailing company provided a picture of the check that was received by Capuno on behalf of Graneta. The account name indicated “MyTaxi.ph Inc,” the company of Grab.  The demand for damages based on the quasi-delict case filed by Graneta against Grab 3 years ago is pending in court. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/241132-grab-partners-with-microsoft-digital-literacy-initiative/","title":"Grab partners with Microsoft for digital literacy initiative","date":"Sep 26, 2019 5:52 PM PHT","snippet":"The partnership is meant to upskill millions of Southeast Asians for the new digital economy","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Grab on Tuesday, September 24, announced a regional partnership with Microsoft for an initiative that looks to equip people and businesses from Southeast Asian countries with the needed digital skills to thrive in fast-growing economies and pursue careers in technology.  The flagship initiative was launched under the ride hailing company’s new social impact program called Grab for Good. “One of the challenges we see in Asia Pacific is the democratisation of education. We believe education should be accessible to everyone, specifically, tech and digital literacy,” said Andrea Della Mattea, president of Microsoft Asia Pacific. “This encourages ingenuity, computational thinking, and problem solving skills, all of which are key to the future.” Grab claims that over 6.6 million workers across the 6 major Southeast Asian countries are going to require reskilling by 2028. Approximately 41% of that number reportedly lack relevant IT skills that new jobs will demand. To narrow the digital skills gap, Grab and Microsoft are combining their resources and ecosystems to fulfill their shared vision to make the economic opportunities in technology accessible for people in Southeast Asia. They aim to train a total of 20,000 people in the region by 2025. There are 3 ways the partnership plans to achieve this. One is by partnering with select universities across the region to train students with technical skills that are in demand by industry. Microsoft will provide the learning materials, curriculum, and certifications, as well as Azure for Education, a platform that provides students access to developer tools for applications; while Grab will facilitate learning experiences such as hackathons and internships. Grab has yet to announce which schools they partnered with. Another way is by providing Grab driver partners access to Microsoft’s Digital Literacy certification program, which has basic courses covering topics such as computer basics, using the Internet, and productivity software. The driver can be awarded a Microsoft certification for free upon completion of the course. These will all be available in the driver’s Grab app. Grab and Microsoft will also help drivers interested in pursuing a career in tech by letting them enroll in a practicum-based curriculum developed by the nonprofit organization Generation: You Employed, or receive certification in Microsoft proprietary courses. Those who will graduate will have opportunities to work for Grab and Microsoft partner companies in technology-related roles. “If the private sector actively creates programs for local communities, technology can be within reach for many, and the learning of new skills can immediately improve the livelihoods for many more people in Southeast Asia,” said Anthony Tan, CEO of Grab. Meanwhile, Grab plans to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro-entrepreneurs running mom-and-pop shops by digitizing their business and having them integrate the platform’s services so they can reach a bigger market. They also plan to provide them economic access through loans and lending services that can give them the capital they need to scale their business In the Philippines, Grab will start with Jollijeep mobile food stalls by offering them access to GrabFood food delivery and GrabPay cashless payments to help them grow and compete with newer restaurants. The project is expected to kick off within the year and will be expanded to other traditional and home businesses moving forward. The other flagship initiative that was announced is called “Break the Silence”. It looks to champion inclusivity by offering differently-abled people such as those who are deaf and the hearing-impaired an opportunity to earn their own income by becoming a Grab driver partner. At the event, Grab announced they will expand the initiative to Indonesia and Singapore and enhance it in countries where it’s already running – like Thailand and Malaysia. The company currently has over 500 deaf driver partners on the platform and plans to double this number over the coming year. The initiative currently cannot work in the Philippines as the Land Transportation Office does not issue professional driver’s licenses to people who are deaf or have other disabilities. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/238874-grab-new-in-app-feature-safety-center/","title":"Grab doubles down on safety through new in-app ‘Safety Center’","date":"Aug 29, 2019 8:36 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing platform invests at least $20 million to work on safety for its users","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines wants to bring its safety incidents down to zero through a newly-launched in-app Safety Center announced on Thursday, August 29. The Safety Center is a centralized access point that contains all of the app’s safety features. Through this button, passengers will be able to share their ride details, report safety concerns, ask for emergency assistance, and review safety information.  After reporting a safety issue, the passenger will receive a digital response within 30 minutes, and a resolution period of two to six hours. When immediate action is needed in transit, passengers could also be connected to proper authorities. Grab has already partnered with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and the Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group for crime prevention and accident response. Grab Philippines President Brian Cu said that the safety center is a continuation of their Safety Everyday Tech Roadmap which was initiated in 2018. It wasn’t brought about by any uptick in criminality. Rather, it was a move to strengthen their safety proposition.  “We went back to our roots and said ‘why did we launch Grab?’ It was safety, convenience, speed. So convenience we sort of solved, speed we fixed the algorithm, safety… was part of the process, but it wasn’t part of the business that we really invested in as much as we did in fixing the algorithms, fixing the speed,” he said. They decided to put in ‘real budget’ for safety development. Cu said they have invested at least $20 million on engineering support, feature development, and insurance to improve the app’s safety. Aside from this new feature, Cu said they are also looking for more women drivers. This is to increase the likelihood of matching women passengers to women drivers so harassment incidents can be reduced. Cu also clarified that drivers go through gender sensitivity training when they get onboarded.  “We take safety very seriously, from onboarding partners all the way up to while they’re in the app. So it’s a bunch of retraining on safe driving, retraining on gender sensitivity, even retraining with partners such as the Highway Patrol Group and even with some health partners as well,” added country marketing head RJ Cabaluna. The Safety Center feature will be fully integrated and available in the app on Friday, August 30. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/238743-grab-investment-vietnam-august-2019/","title":"Grab to invest $500 million in Vietnam","date":"Aug 28, 2019 2:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Ride-hailing firm Grab is making a fresh investment in Vietnam for new services and expansion of existing offerings","body":" SINGAPORE – Ride-hailing giant Grab said on Wednesday, August 28, it will invest $500 million over 5 years in Vietnam, the company’s latest expansion in a key Southeast Asian market.  The Singapore-based firm has grown rapidly since it ended a bruising battle with Uber last year by buying its US rival’s ride-hailing and food operations in the region. Grab, which operates in 8 Southeast Asian countries, has already invested more than $200 million in Vietnam since entering the market in 2014.  The fresh investment will be used for new services in areas such as financial technology and logistics, as well as expanding existing transport, food, and payment offerings. With a population of around 100 million, Vietnam is among the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia. Last month Grab said it would invest $2 billion in Indonesia over the next 5 years, as it seeks to take on local ride-hailing giant GoJek, with some of the money coming from Japan’s SoftBank Group. Grab has received investments of more than $4.5 billion over the past year, with Toyota, Hyundai, and Microsoft among the other firms providing support.

And we’re starting with the SMEs,” said Brian Cu, Grab Philippines president. “SMEs are considered the backbone of Asian economies, making up 99.6% of businesses in the country. Yet, they contribute only a fraction of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP).”   Cu also shared that Grab aims to put at least 1000 more SMEs on the map to allow businesses to be discoverable in-app. Some of the enterprises featured at the fair were Aysees Sisig, Nathaniel’s buko pandan, Ate Rica’s bacsilog, La Paz Batchoy of Liezl’s, Empanada Nation, Bulalugaw, Uncle Moe’s Shawarma, and Cow Wow’s sausages. “We wanted to bring Ilocano dishes in Manila because there’s a lot of Ilocanos here and we saw its potential. People no longer have to travel to Ilocos. Their empanada now is just one Grab away,” said Ellice Chew, owner of Empanada Nation.  Asked how Grab has helped them build their business, Chew said that they were able to reach more people through GrabFood. Meanwhile, Ate Rica’s bacsilog franchisee, Gregory Chen, shared how he decided to promote Filipino classic silog dishes.  “Lagi ko siya kinakain noong college. Nag stick siya even until graduation.

And it’s particularly difficult if you’re doing something for work or school.   Hunger hinders you from giving a project your all. It’s scientifically proven that when your tummy is satisfied, you’re less stressed, better able to concentrate, less prone to mistakes, and more productive. When you’re busy doing things you love, you need food that can power you up to do your best.  You need to listen to your body’s cues – it’s important for your interpersonal relationships and psychological and mental health too.  Late-night munchies are about to become a thing of the past, however. GrabFood recently announced that it would now be operating 24/7.   “With our expanded operations, GrabFood has become a more reliable partner for hungry eaters in the Philippines, catering to a wide variety of palates through its extensive restaurant choices,” says GrabFood country head EJ dela Vega.   GrabFood has expanded exponentially in the past year, with 62% choosing GrabFood as their most used app for online food delivery. The data also saw an increasing trend of late-night orders.  Now, customers in at least 20 areas, including Manila, Makati, Quezon City, Pasig, Pasay, Paranaque, Las Pinas, Marikina, Muntinlupa, San Juan, Caloocan, Valenzuela, Mandaluyong, Malabon, Pateros, Navotas, Taguig, Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu, and Mandaue can enjoy GrabFood services even during the wee hours of the morning.  With the launch of its 24/7 operations, Filipinos have access to over 1,000 restaurants any time of the day, whether they’re looking for budget-friendly comfort food or finer dining options. Customers have a variety of merchants to choose from, including favorites such as McDonald’s, KFC, BonChon, Bully Buffalo Wing Bar, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Mister Kabab, and Ersao. And they haven’t forgotten milk tea! You can get your fix from Chatime and Happy Lemon any time you want.   But don’t starve your wallet while filling your tummy.

Clearer policies on no-shows are also in the works. “I actually think of Metro Manila as a city that never sleeps. We have very booming industries, such as the BPO industry. A lot of Filipinos no longer live in 9-5 lifestyles. And hunger can happen to anyone, anytime.

Loid Herrera: Being his own boss and finding a second family  Twenty-five-year-old Loid Herrera supports his two young kids by working full-time as a GrabFood rider.  Loid previously worked odd jobs in the food industry but enjoys working as a rider more. “Kung minimum earner lang, hindi ko masusuportahan yung dalawang anak ko (If I were a minimum earner, I wouldn’t be able to support my kids),” he says. He now calls himself his own boss. He also found a second family in his fellow riders, with whom he would go on outings during days off. No job is without its difficulties, though. Loid runs into customers who would talk to him rudely, make him wait outside in the heat or rain, or cancel orders after he had already bought the food. For cancelled orders to be reimbursed, he would have to bring them to Grab’s office in Makati.  And that’s the least of a GrabFood rider’s problems. They’re also vulnerable to accidents. Once, while on his way to deliver milk tea, Loid got hit by an ambulance. He messaged fellow riders, who immediately came to his rescue and went with him to file a blotter. Aside from having to take a break from work for over a week, he also had to borrow money to buy a new bike. Thanks to Grab’s gift of P20,000 and groceries, he and his family were able to pull through.  “Thankful kami sa Grab sa ginawa niyang system. Malaking tulong talaga siya sa taong ayaw ng amo pero walang pagpuhunan ng negosyo (We’re thankful that Grab created this system. It’s helpful for those who want to be independent but don’t have the capital for business),” Loid says. Jayson Osita: Working his way through college  At just 21, recent college graduate Jayson is already helping his parents out financially.  Back when he was a college freshman, Jayson saw his parents struggling with money. He decided to withdraw from the private college he was attending. But rather than totally quit schooling, he transferred to a public college and started working. “Sabi ko kay mama, mag-wowork ako. Ayaw pa nga nila nung una, kasi ayaw nila akong makitang naihirapan. Sabi ko, ‘Kaya ko yun, Ma.’” (I told my mother I was going to start working. My parents intially didn’t want me to do it, because they don’t like seeing me struggle. I just said, “I can do it, Ma.”) He started as an all-around crew member of a fast food chain, but he wasn’t earning enough. Besides, the inflexible schedule made it difficult to juggle school and work. Jayson then decided to try working for GrabFood. Right after his last class at 3pm, he’d already go on his way to deliver his first order. “Nakakatulong na po ako kay mama. Nakakaraos din po sa bayaran ng tuition,” he says. (I’m able to help my mother out. I can also pay for my tuition.) His father, who works as a cook, serves as his inspiration. Jayson dreams of setting up his own food-related business once he saves up enough money. He recognizes the importance of education in pursuing this goal, which is why he took up entrepreneurship in college. Working as a rider also changed Jayson’s life in small, poignant ways – he’s now able to try the delicious food he used to only be able to deliver.  Jayson’s definitely a family guy. And he found another family in his co-riders. “Kahit walang booking, nagsasayawan, nagtatawanan,” he says. (While waiting for bookings, we’re all laughing and dancing together.) Alfredo Clemente, Jr.: Breaking limits for PWDs  Alfredo has never let being a PWD get in the way of a job. He previously sold french fries in the streets of Batasan. When his wife got pregnant, he decided to try working for a food delivery service. In February, however, they lost the child, who was born prematurely. Shortly after, the company he was working for suspended its operations.  Fortunately, GrabFood reached out to him and other displaced riders. Alfredo now works as a full-time rider to support his wife and to save up for a better future.  He’s earning a lot more than he used to, but has bigger dreams in mind. “Lahat kasi gusto nilang ma-change yung life nila. Ayoko kasing kung anong ginagawa ko, yun yung ginagawa ko sa pagtanda. Kaya kailangan mag-prepare ka para sa future.” (Everyone wants their lives to change. I don’t want to be doing this my entire life. That’s why you have to prepare for the future.) This is why he sticks to the job – despite the risks that come with late-night deliveries and the profit lost when customers keep him waiting. In the future, Alfredo also wants to help others like him. “Masakit yung ikaw yung nagmamakaawa para tanggapin ka. Plano ko for the future kung papalarin, gusto ko magtayo ng ganito. Para ako naman yung magbibigay ng opportunity sa iba.” (Begging for others to accept you is painful. In the future, if I’m lucky enough, I want to build something like this. So I can be the one to give opportunities to other people.) Not just delivery bots The next time you message your GrabFood rider, remember that on the other side of the app is an actual person, and not just an icon on your phone screen.  Ordering GrabFood today?

Claiming to be the first in the country, Hakoot developer Efren Jamolod Jr. – a Dapitanon working as software architect in Linköping, Sweden – said he, together with his brother Jesrome – a software engineer in Cebu City – developed two applications for the system, one for the garbage collectors and the other for the residents and establishments. “Through their cellphones, residents and establishments can in real time inform garbage collection management (of) the volume and kind of garbage they want to dispose,” Efren said.  He added the city’s solid waste management receives feedback and input, enabling them to efficiently manage the routes of their garbage trucks, effectively dispatch garbage trucks and crew, and decide whether there is a need to send garbage trucks for another round. Efren added Hakoot enables residents and establishments to monitor through their cellphones the location and direction of garbage trucks. An existing ordinance provides that garbage should be taken out to the streets only when garbage collectors arrive.  “Hakoot enables residents to know when to take out their garbage, unlike the present set up wherein residents and establishments have to watch out the whole day for the garbage truck that sometimes doesn’t come,” he said.  Efren also stressed that the maximum effectiveness of Hakoot remains dependent on solid waste management infrastructure – having enough garbage trucks and collectors and the establishment of Material Recovery Facilities and the main residual containment facility.  “We have the residual containment facility, but we still have to prod each barangay leadership to establish their own material recovery facilities, and worst we don’t have garbage trucks, we just borrow two dump trucks from the Engineering Office,” Alvi Agolong, head of Dapitan’s Solid Waste Management operations, said, The problem with borrowing trucks is a borrowed truck can only be used for a single round on its route every day, “and it has to be sent back for engineering works,” Agolong said. Dapitan has only about 5  tons of garbage daily, which can be met up with 3 to 4 garbage trucks and about 32 collectors and drivers.  At present, Agolong admitted they can hardly collect the city’s garbage, “particularly if the schedule is disrupted when the aging dump trucks bog down or if trucks are already full before its routes are completely covered.” Efren noted, “Frustrated residents have no one else to go to but social media.” He added, “We were troubled, annoyed with the rants of our fellow Dapitanons on uncollected garbage, that’s why I called up my brother telling him we have to do something.”  “Thus the birth of Hakoot, but we will continue on improving the software through the feedback of those in the solid waste management (department) and the residents and establishments. Hakoot has to be tailor-fit for the needs of the city,” Efren stressed.  In principle, the Jamolods and the City Government have already agreed to use Hakoot, and a memorandum of agreement will be signed this week with Mayor Rosalina G. Jalosjos, who just ordered the immediate purchase of two new garbage trucks and another two next year.  Asked why the letter “o” is used twice in Hakoot, the developers smilingly replied, “That’s how we Bisaya-speaking pronounce it.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/235793-duterte-word-replaces-constitution/","title":"[OPINION | NEWSPOINT] Duterte’s word replaces the Constitution","date":"Jul 20, 2019 11:00 AM PHT","snippet":"How did we manage to descend so low?","body":"    You can deny it to yourself all you like, but you and I and the rest of the nation have, for all intents and purposes, completed our descent into authoritarianism. When President Duterte said, on national television, that the Constitution is nothing more than toilet paper, yet provoked in us little more than sparse and momentary lip protest, he got us where he wanted us; he got us in the same situation we had found ourselves when his professed idol Ferdinand Marcos put us under martial law, in 1972. We also had refused to believe that Marcos, despite his own broad-enough insinuations, was taking us down that route.  He made his move in the dead of night, giving his targets no chance of escape from a roundup, before revealing a pre-signed proclamation installing himself as the law. The Marcos experience prompted a rewrite of the Constitution; it now provides that, before any extreme emergency, like martial law, goes into force, Congress should vet it and the Supreme Court should resolve all questions of law arising from it. But, with both institutions coopted into the regime, as evidenced by their assent to just about Duterte’s every wish, what’s the point?  Duterte got gang mates out of legal trouble (plunder mainly) or jail; on the other hand, he has taken his critics to court on implausible charges or otherwise persecuted them. He got Marcos a hero’s burial. He has so far gotten away with thousands of kills that have the hallmarks of executions in his war on drugs. For two and a half years now he has kept Mindanao, one of our 3 main islands, under martial law, supposedly because of lawlessness gone out of control. If he seems to have stopped threatening to extend the emergency to the rest of the country, the only reason would be that, with the Constitution now in the sewers, he no longer feels the need for formalities. How did we manage to descend so low?  We must have hit the point of no return when we allowed Duterte to cede control over our geopolitically strategic and resource-rich West Philippine Sea to the Chinese, who promptly took it over exclusively for themselves and proceeded to plunder it not only for fish but for corals and other endangered marine species. Betraying expansive designs, they also began to build an island on its shallows – it’s now an air base and a missile installation. Chinese mainlanders, meanwhile, have been swamping Manila to take up jobs in enterprises set up on Chinese capital (online gambling mostly) and government projects financed with odious Chinese loans, grabbing business and livelihood opportunities from Filipinos. Estimates put the number of these exploitative immigrants between 400,000 and close to a million. The immigration bureau has not released a definite count; the influx must have been too overwhelming for the bureau – and too alarming for us. At any rate, a special gesture of Filipino hospitality is extended to these interlopers; for one thing, instant visas await them at the ports.   And, flying home just now (July 17), from a second trip out of the county this year, I notice for the first time that the immigration “ARRIVAL CARD” has a Chinese translation of the instructions from the previously English-only one.  To anyone who yet doubts that Duterte cares at all, his attitude should have been revealed conclusively when he arbitrarily let off a Chinese patrol that had rammed and destroyed a Philippine fishing boat and abandoned its 22-man crew, who had been pitched overboard. It happened in the same Philippine waters that he had handed over to the Chinese, in fact in the very area designated as Exclusive Economic Zone. The Constitution explicitly prohibits the exploitation of such zones by foreigners.  Warned that, by exempting the Chinese from the prohibition, he committed an impeachable offense, he ditched the Constitution and threatened to have anyone who dared impeach him arrested. That no one has dared is a testament to the sense of dread or futility or both struck among the political opposition, whose number in the House of Representatives, where any impeachment charge should emanate, does not even approach the required one third of the membership to bring it off, the precise excuse made for the default. In fact, by and large, default it is, if not outright collaboration, that has been the attitude of the oversight institutions, including, most regrettably, the Church and the press, toward Duterte. Again, with Marcos, it was the same attitude that enabled him to rule as a dictator for 14 years. And, with Duterte as a worshipper of his memory and protector of his heirs, the Marcos dynasty, coupled now with the Dutertes, lives on. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/234890-grab-philippines-says-transport-holiday-no-effect-passenger-bookings/","title":"Grab: ‘Transport holiday’ had no effect on passenger bookings","date":"Jul 8, 2019 6:20 PM PHT","snippet":"'Passenger booking requests were served well through efforts by TNVS drivers all over Metro Manila,' says Grab Philippines","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Dominant ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines on Monday, July 8, said that the “transport holiday” staged by some transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers did not affect its operations. “Despite TNVS transport holiday initiated by some groups, we have not seen extraordinary difficulties in getting rides today. Passenger booking requests were served well through efforts by TNVS drivers all over Metro Manila,” Grab spokesperson Nicka Hosaka said. “We fully understand and respect our driver-partners and their concerns. We believe however that a dialogue with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is in order to discuss all options and solutions available to address the current issues,” Hosaka added. On Monday, ride-hailing groups held a “transport holiday” in protest of the LTFRB’s requirements for franchise application. The regulatory agency will be meeting with the concerned drivers on Tuesday, July 9, over the implementation of LTFRB Memorandum Circular (MC) 2018-005. In that 2018 memorandum circular, the LTFRB regulated hatchbacks over safety and convenience issues. MC 2018-005 gave a period of 3 years, or until 2021, for hatchbacks to be in operation to give way to repayment of car loans. Senator Grace Poe criticized the LTFRB for prematurely barring hatchback drivers from operating, and called on ride-hailing firms to reactivate their accounts. Drivers and operators also said the additional requirement on “bank conformity” and “proof of financial capacity” made it harder for them to secure a franchise, leading to their deactivation on some ride-hailing platforms. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/233243-men-in-black-international-movie-review/","title":"‘Men in Black: International’ review: An obvious money grab","date":"Jun 17, 2019 1:46 PM PHT","snippet":"'Men in Black: International' is content with being ordinary","body":" The Men in Black franchise’s humor-filled take on the government covering up the proliferation of aliens in the world was once a lucrative uniqueness. It is but inevitable that in this market, an unnecessary and patently lazy attempt to revive the franchise will happen. Bland from the get-go F. Gary Gray’s Men in Black: International is bland from the get-go. The film goes through the motions of setting the storyline, introducing Agent High T (Liam Neeson) and Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) rushing into the Eiffel Tower to supposedly stop an alien invasion. The opening abruptly ends before revealing what is touted to be a twist, giving way to another introduction of another character, Molly, a young girl who allows an adorable alien to escape without her memories being erased. Molly (Tessa Thompson) becomes obsessed with the men in black and makes it her mission to join the ranks. She eventually does and is eventually given the name Agent M. What really propelled the Men in Black franchise to complete an entire trilogy without its fans suffering from fatigue is the cleverly conceived tandem of stoic Tommy Lee Jones and bombastic Will Smith, whose rapport add further absurdity and color to its already absurd and colorful premise. Sadly, Hemsworth and Thompson’s blend of flirtatious nagging and droll jib and jabber are not enough to make this revival truly memorable. The pairing lacks the wit that made Jones and Smith work. Hemsworth and Thompson rely too much on infatuation and romantic inclination to carry with it any real and lasting humor.      Content with being ordinary Men in Black: International is content with being ordinary. Its storyline of a mole that has infiltrated the organization is sorely lacking in mystery and surprises. Its array of aliens is lacking in novelty, with only Pawny (Kumail Nanjiani), the pint-sized and hilariously servile guard, dishing out truly hilarious gags. Gone are the aliens whose intended similarities to the diverse culture that comprise America bear more than a subtle jab at the state of immigrations. Now, they’re all eyecandy, existing only to further exoticism. It is all fine.  Men in Black: International isn’t noxious entertainment. It does get repetitive. The action scenes never astound. The humor is standard fare. If anything, it is really just an unimaginative money grab, with the studios delivering plain popcorn entertainment that has just enough salt and butter to make it tolerable enough to sit through. While it incorporates current attitudes about women finally being recognized, it doesn’t really push for that agenda, making it very clear that its motive is not to correct the past but to capitalize on it.    Pales in comparison Men in Black: International is a film that won’t have people begging for a continuation. It just pales in comparison to its livelier and more ingenious predecessors. — Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/pageants/232924-review-pageant-2019/","title":"Binibining Pilipinas 2019 post-pageant review: Raise your flag, Philippines","date":"Jun 14, 2019 10:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Check out the highlights from this year's pageant","body":" The pageant world eagerly anticipates who wins in the Binibining Pilipinas beauty pageant. After all, whoever wins the right to wear the Miss Philippines sash in Miss Universe, Miss International, Miss Supranational, Miss Grand International, Miss Intercontinental, or Miss Globe is instantly a major threat to other countries. The country’s sash factor has risen considerably because of a proven track record of placements in the past decade. Two major factors have catapulted the Filipinas into the world spotlight. First, the support that the candidates receive from trainers, designers, stylists, the media, the pageant organization and the Filipino people is astonishing. Second, winning the national finals is an arduous task and competing with equally if not more hungry candidates for the same crown takes steely determination and an unwavering spirit. Pia Wurtzbach famously joined 3 times before winning the Miss Universe Philippines title. This year’s pageant showed exactly how difficult and frustrating it can be and how fulfilling it is if you are fortunate. Let’s take a quick look at the highlights of this year’s pageant. Opening number Flanked with over a dozen Philippine flags, the 40 Official 2019 Binibining Pilipinas candidates marched onto the stage in their white, sleeveless, military-inspired mini dresses with gold fringed epaulets. The audience erupted in thunderous applause as they performed the opening number to the song “Raise Your Flag.” This patriotic song was inspired by Catriona Gray’s answer in Miss Universe during an interview. (Photo recap: Binibining Pilipinas 2019 coronation night)   The choreography looked more complex than usual. It evoked a sense of power and a commanding presence of the Binibinis who were charging ahead, as if to say “we are strong, we rule the world, and look great doing it!” Pageant fans were living and the candidates had this expression of overwhelming happiness over the love from the audience.    Monumental anniversaries Bb. Pilipinas Charities Inc. (BPCI) celebrates its 56th year as the country’s leading beauty pageant. Present during the event were BPCI Chairperson Stella Marquez Araneta and her husband Mr. Jorge Araneta, and BPCI Executive Committee, Conchitina Sevilla Bernardo and  Raymond Villanueva. Fifty years ago on July 19, 1969, an 18-year-old Filipina and the 6th Bb. Pilipinas Universe by the name of Gloria Diaz won the country’s first ever Miss Universe crown. It was fitting to have her as a judge. Making a rare appearance at the pageant was Melanie Marquez, Miss International 1979. She was fabulous that night as the day she was crowned 40 years ago in Tokyo, Japan. It would have been nice to have her as a judge. A tribute to these two iconic Filipinas who have been very successful way beyond their reigns would have been quite special. Key figures in pageantry Miss Universe Organization President, Paula Shurgart and MUO Vice President for Business Development & Marketing Shawn McClain were in the audience and patiently stuck it out throughout the entire pageant like everyone else. Also present in the audience were Chavit Singson, architect Richelle Singson-Michael, and Jonas Gaffud of the Miss Universe Philippines Group. They briefly exchanged pleasantries with Mr. and Mrs. Araneta at the Coliseum. It was very nice to see this in front of all the pageant fans. They can at least see first hand that even in the world of pageantry, there is peace. Fans should not concern themselves with controversies. On the right side of the main VIP floor, there were several rows of former Bb. Pilipinas titleholders going way back from the 1970s to the present. Sometimes, I find it odd that I know more about the previous winners than someone who is actually a Binibini or aspiring to become a Binibini. I feel that there should be a special mention for these women who have paved the way. I remember in the 1980s when the former winners are asked to stand up and wave to the crowd. If it will take too long to do that during the actual airing, it can be done during one of the long breaks. Judging the judging panel This year’s 11 judges are comprised of 8 men and 3 women. Four are millennials, 5 from the entertainment industry, 2 were ambassadors and 1 was a beauty queen.   It makes me wonder if the results would have been different if the panel was comprised of more female judges and more former beauty queens. Although I am very happy with the results, I sometimes wonder if judges who don’t know the nuances of the various international pageants could actually select the right candidate for the right pageant. For instance, Miss International does not have a Question & Answer portion but a memorized speech segment. Without prejudice to any of the existing winners and merely to cite an example, someone like Vickie Rushton, who won 6 special awards and is the beauty prototype that Miss International leans towards, might be a good choice. So even with a weak Q&A, she would be a strong international candidate. But then again, much like in the Olympics, an athlete has to perform at the nationals in order to qualify. Show production This year’s production had a very Miss Universe vibe from the music to the pacing. It was fast, quick, high energy, and very exciting. The transitions were smooth (with the exception of the technical glitch) and created momentum. The runway choreography allowed sufficient airtime for the Binibinis to flirt with the camera and the audience and show off their runway skills. The stage, although beautiful, is something I would love to see improved. I think a more streamline and cleaner stage design with visuals that are more solid to create a brighter stage would show off the candidates better. Definitely a lot more lights would be appreciated. Hosts Anne Curtis-Smith and Richard Gutierrez were a perfect combination of fun and formal. Anne looked gorgeous in each and every single outfit she wore. Her down-to-earth persona is very refreshing and is a great contrast to Richard’s more formal demeanor. They give a young and classy image to the pageant.  Nicole Cordoves is the best beauty queen co-anchor because she does it well with so much ease, and she looks stunning doing it. She also has a great sense of humor about the memes that popped up following her box carrying stint.  Special awards I’ve always likened this selection process similar to a commercial casting call. The winners are the ones who would appeal to the sponsors’ demographics. So the candidate with the most mass appeal will usually get it. It was no surprise Catriona Gray swept these awards during her time. She is actually a very in demand commercial model. This year, 6 of these sponsor’s awards went to Vickie Rushton. First set of special awards  Other awards    Disrespectful fans and pageant politics There was disturbing and very noticeable behavior exhibited by some pageant fans during this season and it’s a little more pronounced than before. During the Q&A portion, it was disgraceful for rival fans of a candidate to heckle another candidate who hesitated or stopped even for just a split second. This unconscionable (rude, for those who don’t know the word) behavior is very un-Filipino and un-Christian.  People who behave this way should not claim to be pageant fans or supporters because they go against the very essence of women empowerment, of peace, and of inclusivity. In the future, candidates should also take time to help educate pageant fans on the need for kindness. They should not tolerate it or turn a blind eye. It really needs to stop. (READ: Dos and donts of being a pageant fan) I’ve also noticed that every year, pageant results become more akin to election results where the losing parties always claim fraudulent results. The only year that the results were uncontested was probably in 2018 when Catriona Gray won. Why can’t pageants be that role model by which we show grace in defeat and move on? Al Gore and Hillary Clinton won the popular vote and yet they still chose to gracefully accept defeat and move on with their lives. Having said that, let’s now look at the competition that was. The Top 25 I’ve had a chance to get to know all these women the past three months. I was going to be happy for those who were going to make it into the Top 25. But I was also trying to keep track of their progress. When the announcements were made, these were the ones who I expected and the ones who I was pleasantly surprised with.  Notable misses: What if she was there? Three outstanding, smart, very tall, articulate, and beautiful young Binibinis who were heavily favored to enter the Top 25 shockingly missed the cut. What part of the competition did they miss? If I were to make an educated guess, it would have nothing to do with the free speak or closed door interviews because they are all amazing talkers with great personalities. Or was the competition really just that close? Seeing the aftermath of the Q&A, had any or all of these 3 Binibinis made it to that round, they would have probably impacted the winners circle if they answered to their potential. Swimsuit competition This year’s swimsuit competition had a very island vibe. It allowed the Binibinis to have fun on stage and strut their stuff. Thirteen Binibinis wore one piece asymmetric royal blue swimsuits and 12 Binibinis wore two piece version of the royal blue swimsuits with asymmetric tops. Three of the crown winners were wearing one piece (Gazini, Patch, Leren) and 3 were wearing two piece (Resham, Emma, and Samantha Lo). During the swimsuit round, I feel that the following ladies had the best performances:  Evening gown competition The evening gown competition is where you can either go slow and dramatic or pick a runway tempo. Bb. Pilipinas has a penchant for the former and it worked in favor of Gazini Ganados who eventually won the Best in Long Gown. Showstopping gowns Cary Santiago’s serpentina fuschia gown with pleated wings bustier detail on Gazini Ganados hugged her curvaceous body to create a couture masterpiece. Cary does pleats like it’s nobody’s business. In 2017, he used a similar silhouette and technique on Mariel de Leon’s gown and she also won Best in Long Gown. Chico Estiva’s shimmering, silver fringe gown on Leren Mae Bautista. On paper, this gown has been done over and over. But when it is executed so perfectly and looks expensive, then it works. When Leren moved on stage, it was like molten liquid silver on her skirt dripping with every step. It was breathtaking. Rian Fernandez’s nude illusion, crystal studded gown on Kimberle Penchon. Here’s a lesson to young designers: You don’t have to reinvent the wheel to do something great. You just have to do it well on the right person. Like many, I was dreading to see another nude illusion gown on stage. But when Kimberle came out in this gown, she looked like an A-list celebrity walking down the red carpet. It was well done and she was styled appropriately.  Special mentions on gown performances: Samantha Bernardo wearing Paolo Blanco. Sam was the epitome of grace in motion. The turn that she did at the end was sensational.  Aya Abesamis wearing Renee Salud. Aya pulled out the classic ’80s evening dramatics of flowy chiffon. Younger generations seems to think that Riyo Mori of Japan in 2007 or Taliana Vargas of Colombia in 2008 owned these moves. But it is also reminiscent of her mom’s (Desiree Verdadero, Miss Universe 1984, 3rd Runner-up) evening gown in Miss Universe.  Maria Isabela Galeria wearing Mark Bumgarner. She commanded that stage without a single sequin or crystal. It was all about color, fabric, attitude and legs, legs, legs. Isabela was a stunner.  Jessica Marasigan in Bessie Besana went high society chic instead of pageant pageant with a belted bustier blush gown. She looked tall and sophisticated.  Joanna Tolledo of Caloocan in Daniel Manila and Denise Omorog of Catanduanes in Gio Lazaro Flores are also perfect examples that being clean and simple creates refreshing and stunning effects.     Top 15 This was a solid Top 15 and the judges made very good choices. Farewell to the 2018 Queens  Bb. Pilipinas Globe 2018, Michele Gumabao, Bb. Pilipinas Grand International 2018, Eva Patalinjug, and Bb. Pilipinas Supranational 2018, Jehza Huelar all came out showing why they so rightfully won their titles. They looked even more beautiful than the day they were crowned.    Bb. Pilipinas International 2018 and Miss International 2018 1st Runner-up Ahtisa Manalo, wowed the audience in this red Michael Cinco haute couture ballgown. She is still so young and her future is limitless.  The reigning Miss Intercontinental 2018 Karen Gallman, wore this white, one bedazzled sleeve, serpentina gown by Julianne Syjuco. She looked like an A-list Hollywood celebrity during a movie premiere in Cannes. Again, simple is stunning.  I was seated next to Paula Shugart during the Bb. Pilipinas finals and from the very beginning of the show, it was quite noticeable that each time Catriona’s face was flashed on screen, the entire audience cheered so loudly, much to Paula’s amusement. At one point, I told her: “It never gets old.” So when this rare gem emerged in a custom Mak Tumang flower-inspired gown after her video tribute and delivered a very passionate and touching speech, all I could say was “Catriona for President!”  When the reigning Miss Universe 2018 and the reigning Miss Intercontinental 2018 are the outgoing queens, choosing the right winners becomes even more important.    Miss Universe Philippines 2019: Gazini Christiana Ganados, 23, Talisay, Cebu Special Awards: Face of Binibini, Best in Long Gown  The Gazini gaze Gazini came out like a gorgeous, glamorous gladiator ready for a beauty battle. During the opening number, her stance was solid, her poses were strong, and you could see the determination and fight in her face. When Gazini flirted and blew a kiss to the camera and fllowed with a confident yet playful runway walk with hips swaying and hair tossing, I felt as if I was watching her in Miss Universe already. She does that switch from happy to serious and sexy so well. Both hands on the hips can look silly and amateurish on others but on Gazini, it was great. Her Filipino, Spanish, and Palestinian mix gave her a very universal type of beauty. Her mother is Filipino-Spanish and her father is Palestinian. Gazini says she has never met her father. In fact, the reason she joined pageants was to become famous in the hopes that her father might see her and recognize her. Gazini’s grandparents were also very involved in raising her. She took up nursing in order to be able to take care of them. Elderly care is very close to her heart and is her advocacy. Incidentally, the owner of CHI Haircare by Farouk System Inc., Farouk Shami, is Palestinian-American. They are one of the main sponsors of the Miss Universe Pageant. It is very seldom that we are able to crown a Filipina of Palestinian heritage. When Gazini came out in her Cary Santiago gown and straight hair, it screamed Miss Universe. Much more than her walk, I’d like to coin the term, “The GAZINI GAZE.”  Gazini’s gaze has this mysterious and hypnotic quality that enchants and charms those who look into her eyes. It is fierce yet friendly. It’s a look that can make men fall to their feet in awe of her beauty. What is also most interesting about Gazini is the contrast of her inner and outer beauty. Outwardly, she looks like a movie goddess and sex siren but she really is a simple girl with old school values who was educated in a conservative Catholic school. Her respect and love for her elders was very evident in her final Q&A, wherein she emphasized the importance of keeping the values and wisdom passed on from those who have come before us. Seeing Catriona Gray crown Gazini Ganados was a sight to behold. With Gazini’s beauty, body and personality, the promise of a back-to-back victory is something we can consider. Sure, she needs a bit of polishing in the Q&A department. But I certainly don’t think she deserves the criticism about it. When Venezuela achieved the back to back in 2008-2009, it wasn’t purely because of Q&A.   Bb. Pilipinas International 2019: Bea Patricia “Patch” Magtanong, 25, Bataan Special Awards: Binibining Megawide, Best in Swimsuit  The prima Patchie queen At the Gateway Mall Bb. Pilipinas event, there was prima facie evidence that Patch would make for a perfect Binibining Pilipinas queen. But was being a UP cum laude graduate, a bar exam passer, and having a statuesque figure compelling enough to win her a title? As I talked to her, I was drawn to her warmth and charm. I knew early on that she had major potential. However, I worried a bit for her after the Press Presentation seeing that her runway was still a work in progress. Patch proved that she’s a smart worker and a hard worker because during the finals, she worked the stage and owned it. She was more self-assured and found her stride. Having the support of a strong fan base cheering her on was a big boost as well. There was no doubt that Patch would reach the Top 15. Although I found the skirt portion of her gown a bit too stiff, Patch worked it beautifully. Her styling was on point and she was well on her way to a crown. The moment she was given a microphone, you might as well have given her a crown to go with it. Winning the Best in Swimsuit award solidified her win for one of the top crowns. I chatted with Patch shortly after she received her special award and told her that her Angelina Jolie answer was great. Everyone already knew she was smart. But what that answer did was show that she wasn’t boring. It made her more well-rounded and made her more relatable to more people. Not many people can relate to legal jargon but many can relate to Angelina Jolie. What I love about Patch is that she is open to learning. She’s very smart because she knows when to listen. Although passing the bar exams was big news, what I admire most about her is her advocacy. She hopes to be able to give legal assistance to persons of deprived liberty (PDLs) – something that a lot of people don’t understand because of a lack of compassion for inmates. That’s something that Patch possesses which is a great asset not just as a beauty queen, but as a human being. Patch will represent the country in the Miss International 2019 beauty pageant in Tokyo, Japan on November 12, 2019. She will try to capture our 7th Miss International title, which her predecessor Ahtisa Manalo came so close to winning last year.   Bb. Pilipinas Supranational 2019: Resham Ramirez Saeed, 25, Maguindanao  Resham’s time is now for Maguindanao One of the first things I noticed about Resham is how she pronounces “Maguindanao.” She makes it sound sultry, alluring, and mysterious. She was Miss Philippines Canada 2017 and is now a host and a model. Resham has a fantastic personality and the gift of gab. I knew that with the right set of judges, she could very well become the first Filipina-Pakistani Binibini queen. In a year where some Filipinos are clamoring for “pure Pinay” winners, I wanted to challenge that by having a more diverse group of winners to show more people the changing landscape of the Filipino demographic. There is no one more suited to also voice this message than Resham. She is a staunch believer in celebrating our differences, empowering women, and promoting gender equality. Resham made it to the Top Ten of the National Costume Competition wearing her “Muslim-Filipino Queen” costume with rainbow ribbons from the sarimanok’s tail representing the LGBTQ community. She showed off her excellent physique in a royal blue two-piece swimsuit and sparkled like a diamond in her silver sequined evening gown. Resham is Fierce with a capital “F” and, ironically, that was what worried me a bit for her. But I am glad that the set of judges were the type that got her personality. There was a certain group of Binibinis who I strongly felt could be winners under a particular set of judges. It seems like that was the case on this finals night. Not a stranger to the harsh, cold weather, she will be off to Poland in December for the Miss Supranational 2019 pageant. So far, only Mutya Datul, Miss Supranational 2013, has won this crown for the country.   Bb. Pilipinas Grand International 2019: Samantha Lo, 26, Cebu City  Your spirit will soar high with Miss Lo Samantha Lo is one of those Binibinis who is a bit low key during events but comes alive on stage. But this Cebuana beauty is no stranger to pageants. She joined Miss Mandaue 2017 and Binibining Cebu 2017. When I got a chance to speak to Samantha in one of the events, I realized that she was someone to look out for. She was witty, profound and far from boring. She has “It” – such an amazing personality. Her heritage is also quite an interesting mix because her father is Filipino-Chinese and her mother is Cuban-Nicaraguan. I had placed Samantha in my “Articulate Newbies” group because if everything was on point on pageant night, she would be poised to win a crown. I feel that Samantha gave the best answer of the night when asked about her best non-physical asset. This could have easily gone into the rehearsed pageant answer mode but it did not. Aside from the substance of her answer, Samantha’s delivery was flawless. It was very genuine and sincere. There was no doubt that Samantha would be getting a crown that night. This eloquence will come in very handy in Miss Grand International 2019 where the combination of her beauty, charm and intelligence might finally capture this elusive crown for the Philippines. However, I’m slightly wary of MGI’s planned host country this year, Venezuela, if only because of different travel advisories issued by countries like the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom against it. I would be curious to see if BPCI gives Samantha the go-signal.     Bb. Pilipinas Intercontinental  2019 Emma Tiglao, 24,  Pampanga Special Awards: Pitoy Moreno Best in Costume Award 2019, Miss Pizza Hut 2019, Miss Ever Bilena Advance  The comeback queen The two 2018 runners-up were expected to be the biggest comeback queens by almost all predictions, along with Emma. But as events have unfolded, Emma was the last one standing. It seems that the Bb. Pilipinas 2014 batch of semifinalist was a very persevering group. Nichole Manalo became Bb. Pilipinas Globe 2016, Laura Lehmann went on to become Miss World Philippines 2017, and Pia Wurtzbach went on to become Miss Universe 2015. Now, Emma Tiglao joins this successful list by becoming Bb. Pilipinas Intercontinental 2019. She was only 19 years old when she joined Bb. Pilipinas the first time. Emma is a model, host, and pageant veteran who has certainly polished her skills significantly. She has a smile that lights up the entire Coliseum and her stage presence can be seen and felt even from the cheaper seats. Emma has been consistent throughout the 3 months of competition. She made her presence felt from one of the first sponsor activities wherein she won the Miss Ever Bilena Advance Award. You would never catch Emma with a tired or bored look on her face. She’s a Binibini who you can always count on to have a perky mood. I think that comes from the fact that she knows how important this is to her and that she’s put in so much hard work to get to where she’s at. So she’s not going to let lack of sleep or a bit of fatigue affect her. Emma also garnered a lot of attention with her National Costume by designer Richie Sabinian. It was made with the help of the BJMP Angeles District Jail PDLs (persons of deprived liberty). Emma is very proud of her Kapampangan roots and wanted to celebrate that in various aspects of her competition. Emma faces the daunting task of a back-to-back victory at Miss Intercontinental 2019. Doubly challenging is the fact that Karen Gallman’s win is the first ever for the Philippines. With Emma’s winning personality and beauty, this too is a possibility that the Philippines can entertain.   Bb. Pilipinas Globe 2019: Leren Mae Bautista, 26, Laguna  Ready for the Globe Leren has already experienced winning a title internationally, although it was a minor one. So expectations for her were very high. Luckily for Leren, she didn’t disappoint. I’d have to say Leren’s Bb. Pilipinas journey was a slow burn. But when she got her stride, she just kept on building momentum until there was no stopping her. She has this sultry FIlipina beauty that is both sweet and sophisticated. She commands the runway and feels very at ease on stage. On finals night, her Chico Estiva silver fringe gown made Leren too hard to ignore for a crown. She delivered a Q&A that was heartfelt and sincere. Looking at Leren now, it is hard to imagine how such a stunning woman was once a child who was bullied for her looks.  Leren is a very humble, kind and sweet person. She’s the perfect role model and spokesperson for campaigns against bullying because she survived it and is now thriving.  Leren will compete in Albania and follow a successful list of Filipinas who have done very well at the Miss Globe pageant. The last time we won this pageant was in 2015 with Ann Colis.   The runners-up  Aya Abesamis, 27, Pasig City Although she didn’t end up a Binibining Pilipinas queen, I am still very happy because on her final attempt, Aya Abesamis placed. Given the age limits of pageants, she isn’t eligible to join most of the international pageants. But Aya has significantly transformed herself from last year. Samantha Bernardo, 26, Palawan Special Awards: Miss Blackwater My heart sank when Samantha Bernardo was announced as 2nd runner-up. I know how hard this young woman has worked and how much she’s grown since last year. She has been so consistent throughout the 3 months of competition and was well on her way to a crown. To end up in the same 2nd runner-up post despite all the sacrifices must be very disappointing. But in reality, although she has the same title, she is no longer that same person from last year. She has grown tremendously into a much stronger, more confident woman. For that, she is a winner. Never say never queens From this year’s batch, I truly believe that there were three Binibinis who have all the potential in the world. For as long as their dream of becoming a Binibini is far stronger than their fears, then I feel they should give it another try. Maria Isabela Galeria of Sorsogon  I did not place her in my Best Bets list because I felt she was too young and needed more pageant experience. Seeing her perform affirmed that she is a force to reckon with. If she is able to conquer her nerves and appear calmer on stage, she can stake home a major crown. She has the beauty, the body, and brains. She just has to truly believe it to achieve it.  Hannah Arnold of Masbate My gut feel is that Hannah was still too raw to join this year. She has Universe potential written all over her but needs lots of polishing and honing by the right team. She is still very young and can join the pageant in the future when she is truly ready to take it all the way.  Vickie Rushton of Negros Occidental If you look at Pia Wurtzbach’s story, she did not place at all in her second try. But sheer will power and drive got her the Miss Universe title. If it is Vickie’s desire to become a beauty queen and represent the Philippines, then she will find the strength and courage to come back next year for one last hurrah. We already know she has what it takes. Now, she just has to deliver all the way to the end and not be distracted by anything or anyone that gets in her way.  This year’s edition of Bb. Pilipinas is a triumph because the winners are representative of the #beyondbeauty slogan. They each have life stories that inspire, advocacies that motivate, spirits that uplift, and voices that empower not just women but all the people that they meet.  The effects of a Binibini are far reaching – beyond women, beyond Metro Manila, beyond our shores. That is what makes our Binibinis truly beyond beautiful. — Rappler.com Voltaire has 10 years experience in the fashion industry.

During a hearing held by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Grab Philippines president Brian Cu said that of the supposed 8,000 drivers who were told that they will be removed from the platform by Monday, June 10, only 5,000 were deactivated. “As of yesterday, there were around 5,000 drivers who were deactivated because [they don’t have] documentation. They weren’t able to submit proof that they walked through the LTFRB process in securing a provisional authority (PA) or a certificate of public convenience (CPC),” Cu told reporters in a press briefing after the hearing. The remaining 3,000 were able to submit proof to Grab that they are in the process of applying for a PA or CPC. To lawfully operate, drivers and operators need to secure a PA – the initial authorization – and then a CPC. On top of the 5,000, the ride-hailing firm also removed some 10,000 drivers from January to May this year, bringing the total deactivated units to 15,000. Cu said during the hearing that they did this to ensure that there are no “colorum” vehicles on their platform. “This is really because of a regulation that we need to comply with. We have been wanting to comply with this regulation that TNVS (transport network vehicle services) should have [a] PA or [a] CPC to operate,” Grab Philippines spokesperson Nicka Hosaka said. “But we find it difficult to enforce because we do it manually. We talked to them one by one. We reached out to them,” she added. To ensure that there will be enough drivers despite the deactivation, Cu said they will roll out a new incentive scheme. “If there will be 10 cars that drive an extra hour, then it would supplement. It covers the hours lost [due to deactivated vehicles]. Over the next few weeks, we’re trying to structure out incentives and promos to be able to do that,” he said. More cars needed In a separate statement on Tuesday, Grab urged the LTFRB “to find ways to quickly increase the number of drivers.” On Monday, the LTFRB opened 10,000 new slots for the application of a TNVS franchise. All slots were already filled up that day. “If LTRFB will allow the deactivated drivers to resume work while it processes the application of 10,000 new drivers, that would be the best win for the Filipino people,” Cu said in a statement. Grab is now left with around 40,000 drivers. Before the deactivation, it had served only 60% to 65% of the total bookings daily. Grab urged the regulatory board to maximize the 65,000-franchise cap, to be able to allocate more cars to passengers. With the deactivation of “colorum” vehicles, Cu said passengers will bear the brunt of the inconvenience. “This inconvenience will be felt even after the 10,000 new slots, as twice that number is necessary to provide the 70% allocation rate they said they (LTFRB) want to maintain,” he said. But Cu said fares will remain the same, to comply with the conditions set by the Philippine Competition Commission over the March 2018 buyout of Uber’s operations. (READ: Antitrust body OKs Grab-Uber deal, sets conditions) According to LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III, some 5,000 units out of 40,000 have CPCs.

Grab deactivated some 8,000 drivers without a certificate of public convenience (CPC), which was a requirement of the LTFRB. In a press briefing on Monday, June 10, drivers enumerated the following processes which make securing the requirements to get a CPC difficult: CPC hearing process – Drivers said Transport Netwrork Vehicle Service (TNVS) operators can only be represented by either the spouse, parents, or descendants. They said this requirement affected many operators leading to dismissals and resultingr in monetary losses. “TNVS operators affected mostly are those who work abroad, doing part time for TNVS, or not based in Metro Manila,” their statement read. Drivers appealed to the agencies to allow them to issue a special power of attorney to any person they want to represent them. Bank conformity – This document is secured from banks and allow the units to be used for public transportation. “Different banks have their own processes and fees in securing this certificate,” the drivers said. Moreover, they said that this requirement was only good for companies with a fleet of cars. In the case of TNVS, most only have one car or two. “Many operators cannot comply, some banks will ask for thousands of pesos in fees, plus an increase of monthly amortization,” the drivers said. Instead of a bank conformity, they proposed getting a commercial insurance of their choice to still protect the interest of the banks. Proof of financial capability – The LTFRB increased this requirement 233% to P50,000, from P15,000. Drivers said this is hard for many small entrepreneurs.  “Many have no savings of P50,000, and it is only now that they are able to save…. We pray for the board to recompute the amount that is fair for small businesses,” the statement read. Due to the problems cited, many TNVS operators supposedly gave up and had their cars surrendered to banks.

The LTFRB said it regularly sends a report to Grab containing the list of drivers who apply for government accreditation. “Drivers who do not apply at all for a certificate of public convenience should have already been deactivated by Grab per LTFRB order issued months ago,” the agency said. The LTFRB added that over 5,000 provisional authorities remain unclaimed by applicants. Grab recently announced it would deactivate drivers of “colorum” units who have not yet submitted any proof that they were granted provisional authority by the LTFRB.

In taking over his candidacy, Batocabe was among at least half a dozen women standing in for their slain husbands this year – a long tradition in the Philippines’ notoriously deadly politics. Dozens of people, including candidates and their supporters, routinely get killed in the fierce competition for elected posts that are a source of wealth in a nation with deep poverty. Over 18,000 seats, ranging from local councils to the upper house Senate, are up for grabs when the nation’s more than 61 million voters are called to cast ballots on Monday.  One widow styled her campaign as a quest for justice for her husband, who was murdered last year after announcing plans to run for mayor in Trece Martires, a city south of Manila. “My name is Gemma Lubigan. I will take up the fight of Vice-Mayor Alex Lubigan,” she told a cheering crowd at a recent campaign rally. A political rival, the sitting mayor of Trece Martires, was initially fingered as a suspect, but prosecutors have declined to file charges. Political widowhood reached its apogee in the Philippines in 1986, when Corazon Aquino took power after a bloodless popular revolt that toppled the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The upheaval was triggered by the 1983 assassination of her opposition leader husband Benigno Aquino at the hands of security forces loyal to Marcos, forcing her into politics. In the Philippines, widow candidates carry a powerful aura of suffering and perseverance that resonates with voters in the overwhelmingly Catholic nation, experts say. “It works especially in the Philippine context because widowhood has symbolic elements that are very much valued in politics,” said University of the Philippines political science professor Jean Franco told AFP. (READ: ‘The San Fernando Kill List Part 1: ‘I Will Kill You All‘) The Philippines also lacks a strong party system so family dynasties play a similar role, with wives called on to assume the clan’s figurehead position after a slaying. ‘I’m careful’  Some of Asia’s most powerful political families have been marked by the same phenomenon. India’s Sonia Gandhi was pushed into politics after her husband, former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, was assassinated.  Benazir Bhutto led Pakistan’s return to democracy about a decade after her father was ousted as prime minister in a coup and subsequently executed. Political analyst Franco said the rise of the Philippine widows also marks a way into the nation’s male-dominated political area. “Many of our female politicians, especially at the local level, are members of political dynasties,” she added. Before Rodel’s murder, the plan was for the Batocabes to groom their first-born son, a newly minted lawyer, to follow his father’s footsteps into politics.  But that changed after Rodel, who was an ally of President Rodrigo Duterte, was gunned down days before Christmas while handing out gifts to elderly and disabled Daraga residents.

Grab Philippines said that select vehicles will have car stickers on the initiative that would identify it as part of the campaign, as well as flyers on how to vote which will be given out by the drivers to passengers. On Election Day, Metro Manila and Cebu voters can use the promo code “ONEDESTINATION” when they head to polls to enjoy a P50 discount. “Misinformed and disenfranchised voters are one of our top challenges in the Philippines during the election,” Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said. “As Grab, our role goes beyond providing safe, seamless, and reliable services to our customers but to also cultivate a sense of community and unity among our fellow Filipinos,” he added. Comelec spokesperson James Jimenez said that they want the voters to be more informed as Election Day draw nears, so they “grabbed” this opportunity to partner with the ride-hailing firm. Jimenez said that they are eyeing to “come close” with the voter turn-out in 2016, which was at 81%.

If a driver goes “above and beyond,” Grab said there is a new “tipping feature” that allows the passenger to reward the driver with a 5-star rating. What are the new measures for passengers?  When a driver cancels, meanwhile, 30 GrabRewards Points will automatically be awarded to the passenger. In what instances will there be no fees? Grab president Brian Cu said they are aware that “sometimes, cancellations are necessary during special situations.” There will be no fees if: If a fee was charged wrongly, Grab said it will give a refund within 48 hours, if the matter is reported through the Help Center on the app. “Our intention in implementing this new policy is to create a better ride-hailing ecosystem, where both passengers and drivers practice the responsible use of the Grab platform,” Cu said. Grab remains the dominant ride-hailing company in the Philippine market, following its acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia business in March 2018. Several new firms cropped up, but they have yet to make a significant difference in the market.

And they’re aggressively competing to be adopted by both consumers and merchants. It’ll take some time before we determine who emerges on top – right now, only a portion of the population is using e-wallets. But here’s how the competition is playing out so far. The cream of the crop Among standalone apps, GCash ranks number one on both Google Play and App Store, according to data from analytics firm App Annie. Take note that Android accounts for roughly 83% of mobile operating systems in the Philippines, so you may want to pay more attention to the Google Play column. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259176/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:400px;’></iframe>{/source}   Longtime player GCash and rival PayMaya were created by the innovation units of the country’s powerful telco duopoly: Globe Telecom’s Mynt and PLDT/Smart’s Voyager Innovations, respectively. Coins.ph, founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron Hose in 2014, is a blockchain-based mobile payments startup that recently sold a majority stake to Indonesia’s ride-hailing behemoth Go-Jek. PayPal probably needs little introduction. Set up in 1998, the US firm is a pioneer that introduced the world to the idea of sending funds to anyone across the world – online. It’s also a staple secure payment method for e-commerce sites globally. Another force to contend with is GrabPay, the e-wallet embedded in the app of Grab, Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing firm. Grab tops the “Travel” and “Maps & Navigation” categories in the Philippines. App ranking is a good gauge of an app’s performance. It doesn’t just count downloads, but also factors in things like uninstalls, rating, usage, and more. However, it doesn’t give you the full picture. Other factors – such as monthly active users, transaction volume/value, competitive differentiation, financial muscle, stickiness, user acquisition costs, revenue, user experience, and so on – matter, and we’ll look into some of these later on. Same same but different First, let’s check out the compelling e-wallet models that have popped up worldwide. In emerging markets with a large unbanked population, a common model is one focused on financial inclusion. Here, an e-wallet is possibly the user’s first experience with a formal financial service, rather than a bank account. The e-wallet can perform basic functions – cash in/out, money transfers, as well as micropayments (e.g. phone credit top-ups). Then you have the ecosystem play. This e-wallet is part of an app that’s engaged in segments such as transportation, logistics, and shopping. Its users are already kind of digitally savvy, likely banked but do not necessarily qualify for credit cards. The app operator accepts cash as a mode of payment, but its e-wallet offers convenience and greater benefits. Philippine telcos kicked off their e-wallet services – GCash and Smart Money – in the 2000s with a wider financial inclusion goal. They initially offered SIM-based remittance and micro payments, making use of a vast network of agents – mostly sari-sari stores – to facilitate the transactions. This kind of remittance works this way: a customer hands a store cash, the store sends the amount via mobile phone to another store where the customer’s recipient can claim the money – also in the form of cash.  Years after introducing SIM-based e-money services, the telcos launched app versions to boost use cases and cater to the rapidly growing, digitally savvy base of smartphone owners in the country – whether they’re unbanked or banked. Coins.ph started out as a cryptocurrency exchange (buying and selling cryptocurrencies) and evolved into a suite of payments services similar to the telco apps. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/5857203A97624D1C8426325943F475E6/coins.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Meanwhile, GrabPay is part of the Grab ecosystem, which started with ride-hailing and branched out into more services, including courier and food delivery. Now, all these apps are aiming to transform into a third model: the lifestyle super app. Many e-wallet providers are eyeing this as an end-state, but few have been able to achieve it. Lifestyle super apps are ecosystems of services that have built an extensive base of active users – unbanked and banked – and have become indispensable in daily life. They’re not just used to pay online, but also in physical stores. Sitting on volumes of customer transaction data, these apps monetize that data by offering adjacent services like micro-loans. The greatest success stories can be found in China, where Tencent’s WeChat and Alibaba-backed Alipay are used by people to pay for almost everything in the country. An outlier in the local scene perhaps is PayPal, which falls under another model that hinges on payment convenience. Largely targeting the banked segment, PayPal’s early solution stored and safeguarded bank card details, enabling users to shop on websites via their PayPal accounts without giving away those sensitive details to sellers. For sellers, the US company provided a checkout system for accepting online payments. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/1ED17AD5396F4A779AD4016924D33A9F/paypal.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   In the Philippines, PayPal’s app works the same way, storing card details that users can use to pay other users or businesses with PayPal accounts. It can’t be used for payments in physical shops, but its balance can be transferred to other mobile wallets that are accepted by stores. What makes them stand out Though still a ways off, GCash seems to be leading the race to become a lifestyle super app in the Philippines. That’s thanks in part to its progressive and first-mover approach. Thinking that direct peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers are the future, for instance, GCash decided to move away from sari-sari store-facilitated remittance as soon as it launched its app in 2012. The reason was simple: how do you persuade people to go cashless and digital if you don’t eliminate – or at least try to reduce – cash and human intervention in the transactions?  {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/E8598F9B04734E54A88C95A1561035B6/g-cash.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   While some may argue the move could mean missing out on the base-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market in rural areas that’s reliant on agents for money transfers, it has allowed GCash to capture more of the urban consumers who are receptive to mobile technology and have higher-value transactions. Other moves that makes this progressive approach evident: Playing catch-up, PayMaya, which was launched in 2015, has yet to introduce such features. And its SIM-based counterpart Smart Money has maintained the biggest network of agents – 26,000 as of last count, most of which are sari-sari stores. But that’s due to the strong demand that its Smart Padala service has enjoyed from the BOP market, who are mostly located in rural areas with no stable internet connection, and still own feature phones. On the upside, this means a healthy revenue stream for Smart Money and a potential new base of users for PayMaya – if the latter successfully persuades the former’s users to migrate to the app, that is.  Nevertheless, the competition is still in its early days, and GCash and its rival camp are expected to extend well beyond their current focus segments. Moreover, both GCash and PayMaya – by virtue of being owned by the telcos – could have the strongest brand recall and consumer trust among the apps. Since Tencent, Alibaba’s chief competitor, made an investment in Voyager last year, you could say that the GCash-PayMaya battle is an extension of the war between China’s tech giants. What makes Coins.ph unique, on the other hand, is its underlying blockchain technology. What this means is it can store, transfer cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum), and convert them into pesos, helping it capture a niche. Coins.ph probably got a boost when Bitcoin prices were hitting record-highs a couple of years ago as more people got in on the action. However, the Bitcoin hype started fading as prices slumped.  While cryptocurrencies are considered volatile investments due to wild price fluctuations, blockchain has real utility for cross-border money transfer. Two reasons: it’s quick and cheap. Settlements using blockchain are instant, versus about an hour through a service like Western Union, or two to three days through banks. That’s because money transferred the traditional way goes through financial intermediaries, which are subject to strict regulation and charge fees. Blockchain keeps track of transactions using a digital ledger where entries cannot be fudged, so it eliminates intermediaries from the picture and lowers the costs (if you want to know more about blockchain, here’s a good resource). At the moment, Grab’s strength lies in ride-hailing where it has monopoly after beating Uber in Southeast Asia. On-demand transportation is a daily use case that’s hard to beat. The Singapore-based firm’s food delivery and courier features are also gaining a lot of traction among users in the region. While Grab is a frontrunner in launching financial services, including credit scoring and micro-loans, in markets like the Lion City, it’s still in the rollout phase for such services in the Philippines. This means it has to play catch-up with most of the local apps. But Grab’s regional presence also means it has economies of scale – it’s able to share costs over several markets.  {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/9E230ABABC234F329B97C2DB0CED5965/grab.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   For its part, PayPal’s global payments service has become the method of choice among individuals catering to overseas clients. Next to the US and India, the Philippines’ gig economy is ranked third in the world, with more people opting for online jobs to avoid long commutes and work flexible hours. Citing data from the Global Freelancer Survey, PayPal claims that its platform is widely used by freelancers in the Philippines (92%), Indonesia (88%), and Singapore (76%). Although domestic clients opt for bank transfers, about 76% of payments from international clients are made via PayPal, the survey notes. Here’s a comparative look at most of the finance apps’ features: {source}<iframe class=”app-features” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259205/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Here are Grab’s features in the Philippines at the moment: Increasing stickiness In theory, the more services an app has, the stickier it gets since existing users have more reasons to use it (how frictionless and efficient the services are is another story). Developing new services is also a way to add users and reduce the risks posed by regulatory changes in one sector – for example, transportation. This suggests improved long-term viability. In the same way, having a vast network of merchants who accept this mode of payment is critical to accelerate usage.  The ease of cashing in is important, otherwise there’s really no incentive for people to fund their e-wallets. Here are ways to add funds to the different e-wallets: {source}<iframe class=”to-cashin” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263579/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The ability to convert e-wallet balances into cash or return them to bank accounts is also just as crucial in driving adoption, especially if the market has yet to overcome the trust barrier. Without this ability, it’s like having unused miles stuck with an airline company. GCash and PayMaya allow users to withdraw cash via ATMs using their linked prepaid cards. These ATM withdrawals, however, come with the usual bank charge. Speeding ahead of other players, GCash now lets users transfer their balances to more than 30 banks in the country for free. Although PayPal allows transfers to banks, the minimum amount required without incurring fees tends to be relatively high for the general population. In the Philippines, the transfer will not incur charges if the amount is P7,000 (US$138) and above. On top of that, banks impose fees which further reduce the amount to be received by the user. Below are the different cash-out options offered by the apps: {source}<iframe class=”to-cashout” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263583/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Apart from drivers’ takings, Grab does not allow users to change GrabPay credits into cash or transfer them into bank accounts. This means Grab will have to contend with providers that offer cash redemption. Attracting merchants E-wallets are impractical for people without stores that take them, and no merchant will accept e-wallets if their customers don’t use them. Players have to find a way to build both sides of the marketplace. If an app collects a critical mass of users and merchants, it becomes harder for a competitor to lure them away. Merchants would find it tough to ignore Grab and GCash’s user base. Grabbers come from across Southeast Asia, where the firm controls the ride-hailing sector and is increasingly encroaching into the travel space through its partnerships (Booking.com is an investor in Grab, for example). Hence, Grab’s local arm is poised to capture tourists visiting the Philippines from neighboring countries.  For its part, GCash has integrated with affiliate Alipay to allow the latter’s users – mostly Chinese nationals – to make purchases from merchants that accept GCash. It’s uncertain whether PayMaya has done the same with its ally WeChat. In the Philippines, where most payments still happen offline, offering physical stores a mobile payment system that doesn’t require huge capital expenditure is a sound step toward sweeping adoption. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/9504C856932C4236AD521F864470667E/paymaya-checkout.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   QR code tech is way cheaper than near-field communication (NFC) and the traditional point-of-sale (POS) terminals or cash registers. Except for PayPal, all local apps have QR code capabilities.  {source}<iframe class=”qr-merchants” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/274752/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Though Grab’s QR can’t be used in stores yet, the company has struck a partnership with retail titan SM to offer it in malls soon. Another key selling point is the fact that apps charge merchants lower fees (% of transaction value) for payments compared to credit cards. Heavy ammunition With an extensive user and merchant base comes significant revenue potential. Most apps charge users minimal transaction fees for things bought or paid for on their platforms to fuel adoption. Even without those fees, there’s potential to earn from users’ balances. In China, Alipay and WeChat Pay hold billions of dollars in funds that accumulate in their apps when users do not immediately use the funds or transfer them to a bank or investment account. The firms invest those funds to generate returns. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/712272D9E64A4B409F0BFDEC42CAC0E9/ali-pay-we-chat.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   However, the companies are said to be losing that revenue after the Chinese government required that all e-wallet funds be deposited in non-interest bearing accounts with the central bank, rather than private institutions. More than the user fees, players earn from taking a cut of merchant sales – online and offline. Ultimately, the lifestyle apps serve as e-commerce platforms where third-party merchants and the apps themselves or their parent companies sell their products and services. In this case, payments essentially act as the backbone that allows the transactions to happen. For instance, Globe and Smart are using GCash and PayMaya to sell phone credit top-ups. Coins.ph is offering its crypto exchange and trading services – akin to how a foreign currency exchange service and stock exchange work. Here’s how many e-wallet accounts there are in the Philippines, as per government data: {source}<iframe class=”ewallet-accounts” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239889/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} And here are the companies’ own user stats: {source}<iframe class=”companies” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259234/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The picture looks rosy if we go by the players’ numbers. However, it’s uncertain how much of their user acquisition is organic. App companies spend not just on ads but also marketing promos – cashbacks and price discounts, among other things – to hook price-sensitive Filipinos and foster frequent use.  That’s not to say those subsidies are at all bad. For new technologies, subsidies are a potent – perhaps necessary – tool to acquire users and increase adoption. However, they’re costly to maintain, so winning the payments war will require deep pockets. The road to making money will be long and hard, but there are enormous rewards for becoming the dominant player. The question then becomes: who will last in the game? All the key players in the market right now have heavy war chests and high-profile investors in their rosters. {source}<iframe class=”high-profile” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263586/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The risk with cashbacks and discounts is that they may not necessarily inspire loyalty to a particular brand. In a situation where two players offer exactly the same services, people tend to gravitate towards the one that gives out more promos. So organic approaches like growing your merchant base and differentiating your product to entice users, as well as robust loyalty programs to keep users engaged are vital. Grab has a rewards program that lets users gain points as they use the app and progress up the tiers. The higher their tier is, the more rewards they can access. In Singapore, Grab has begun to offer subscription plans wherein users pay a fee upfront to avail of bundled discount vouchers across its services. The plans lock in customers for a longer period: the vouchers are already paid for so people are inclined to use them. What’s even more interesting is that the subscriptions are linked to the rewards program. Rides booked under the subscriptions earn reward points. On GCash, credit scoring and micro-loans will only be unlocked after a certain level of usage. The app, which currently has the most number of QR merchants, also introduced a program where users get vouchers after a purchase, to keep them coming back. To better gauge how an app is performing, one can look at active users and transaction volume/value. Unfortunately, the local apps are keeping those numbers under wraps. GCash claims that its active user base has grown 4x from 2017 to 2018.  We reached out to the other players for stats and other info, but have yet to receive a response. What consumers are saying Overall, companies will have to compete in terms of the quality of their products and services, including the crucial user experience. To know more about what people think of the payments apps, TheNerve used its natural language processing tool to monitor and analyze Twitter posts about them.

Having several e-wallet firms that spend for marketing campaigns raises consumer awareness and expedites adoption. At this point, players are fighting a common stubborn enemy: cash. Today, cash still makes up 99 percent of Philippine transactions. That means the market may remain fragmented, with more players potentially throwing their hat into the ring. Yet having too many options can also hinder adoption. It’s tedious for a user to maintain dozens of apps. In the long run, consolidation is bound to happen (we’ve actually seen a form of consolidation when Go-Jek acquired control of Coins.ph). In China, which is past the tipping point for mass e-wallet adoption, it’s evident: this is a sector where only a couple of players hold the majority of the market.  Players are expected to heavily burn cash to compete for market share so that means those with the deepest pockets will survive. It also means that profitability may be a long way off.  As e-wallet adoption grows, banks will be gravely affected. Apart from losing out to e-wallets in the unbanked market, existing transactions in their credit and debit card systems may shift to mobile as well. To stay relevant, they must determine how to compete and collaborate with new payment methods. Seeing the onslaught ahead, the country’s lenders have led the talks to come up with a national QR code system with the goal of having the codes readable across financial apps – bank or non-bank. So this means that a merchant can display a single QR code that all payments providers will be able to scan. This kind of interoperability will level the playing field. How the landscape will evolve when banks join the fray is definitely something to watch.

Major Gideon Ines Jr, Makati police investigation chief,  identified the suspect as 31-year-old Grab driver Hyron Henry Roscom, who faced a grave threat complaint. According to a police report, Roscom pointed a “gun” at security guard Genonevo Azarcon Jr along J.P. Rizal Avenue in Barangay Olympia, Makati, at around 2 am on April 1. This apparently happened before Roscom went inside a bar. Acting on the complaint of Azarcon, village watchmen arrested Roscom as soon as he got out of the bar. Roscom denied he pointed a gun at Azarcon and said he was shocked when he got arrested. He admitted, however, that he had a pellet gun in his car – a caliber .38 revolver replica – which was seized by police. Ines said that police would retrieve the closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage of the bar to verify the claim of the driver. Roscom is currently under police custody. Nicka Hosaka, Grab Philippines Public Affairs Manager, said in a statement that the company had banned Roscom after it was informed about the incident. “Grab does not condone such alarming behavior. We have already banned the driver from the platform as we continue our own internal investigation of the incident. We likewise extend our full cooperation to the authorities in support of their investigation,” Hosaka said. “The safety and security of our users is of utmost priority to us,” she added. Grab Philippines urged Grab users to report to its hotline – 02-8837107 – “any behavior which puts the welfare of our community at risk.” – With a report from Aika Rey/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/226837-list-3-in-1-coffee-picks/","title":"Adulting 101: Your guide to 3-in-1 coffees in the Philippines","date":"Apr 1, 2019 6:30 AM PHT","snippet":"Which is your favorite?","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Aside from love and music, coffee is a universal language of its own, and a brew-tiful one at that. Spoken by millions of Filipinos, there’s definitely no room for coffee condescension here – some clamor for the best single-origin coffee they can find, some are perfectly content with their favorite freshly-brewed fastfood cup, and for some, 3-in-1 remains their number one.  Because why not? It’s affordable, flavorful, easy to find, easy to prepare, and comes in a variety of flavor choices. Which is your go-to 3-in-1 coffee pick? The OG: Nescafé Original  The starter 3-in-1 coffee, Nescafé Original became the gateway drug of many into the world of instant caffeine (and sugar). The Original variant had mastered the basic formula of a good 3-in-1 early on – owning that familiar, comforting blend of sweetness and creaminess, accompanied by that distinct kick of coffee.    The creamy of the crop: Kopiko Blanca  Prefer your coffee on the creamier side? Kopiko Blanca’s gotchu. Kopiko’s take on the milky “white coffee” phenomenon has bean – and continues to be – a favorite among coffee lovers with a sweet tooth.   The price is white: Nescafé Creamy White  Another creamy coffee contender is Nescafé’s Creamy White option – a silky-smooth, uber-sweet go-to cup of coffee many have espresso-ed their love for, which we heard is extra yummy iced, too! (Plus, it’s KathNiel-approved.)   Sugar? Yes please: Kopiko Brown  Going easy on the cream, but hard on the brown sugar? If you like taking your morning cup with a spoonful of brown/muscovado sugar, go to town with Kopiko Brown. It’s got the right mix of coffee and sugar – saktong sweet but not at all bitter – just like the jowa of your dreams.   Once you go black: Kopiko Astig  Need something strong and that’ll last you all night long? Try Kopiko Astig – Kopiko’s “stronger” variant – a rich 3-in-1 favorite that packs a heavier coffee punch than the rest.      For the fancy shmancy: Essenso  If #treatingyourself means grabbing a packet of sosy Essenso Coffee, by all means, please do so. San Mig’s Essenso Coffee stands out among its fellow grocery sachets, thanks to its sophisticated packaging and branding, and features a premium blend made from finely-ground 100% arabica. It’s not excessively sweet, tastes almost like a non-instant cup, yet is easily likeable in taste.     No sugar, no problem: San Mig Coffee Sugar-free  Weaning off sugar but still craving for that cup of coffee? Why feel depresso if you’ve got sugar-free espresso? Well – San Mig Coffee’s Sugar-free option, that is. Made with splenda, this 3-in-1 packet is low in fat, low in calories, but definitely not low in flavor.   International visitor: Old Town Coffee  Hailing from abroad, Old Town has made its way to Philippine shores, and we welcomed its 3-in-1 army with open arms.  Offering a variety of flavors (cane sugar, low sugar, regular, and our favorite: hazelnut), each sachet is filled to the brim with its distinct 3-in-1 powder blend, guaranteeing a rich, smooth, cup of coffee we love a latte. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/226807-grab-igib-quezon-city-marikina/","title":"Need water?

Grab’s Public Affairs Manager Nicka Hosaka said in a statement on Saturday, March 23, that the driver became suspicious when the two students refused to open the package they were sending to Bonifacio Global City. “This prompted the GrabExpress driver to deliver the package straight to the police station instead,” Hosaka said. The students are facing charges for violation of Republic Act No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act. Grab commended the driver and vowed to continue its coordination with government agencies “to prevent the use of the platform for delivering” illegal drugs and questionable items. “Grab continues to engage its driver partners to be alert and vigilant of suspicious activities in the performance of their duties, to help promote a drug-free and crime-free Philippines,” the company said. The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) earlier warned that drivers of ride-hailing services were being used for deliveries of illegal drugs. In September 2017, Grab country head Brian Matthew Cu said only less than 10 deliveries had been involved in such incidents, but that the drivers were used as “tools” and were not accomplices. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/226381-ronaldo-fined-mimicking-crotch-grabbing-celebration/","title":"WATCH: Ronaldo fined for crotch-grabbing celebration","date":"Mar 22, 2019 12:24 PM PHT","snippet":"Cristiano Ronaldo escapes ban but gets slapped with a 20,000-euro fine for his Champions League celebration","body":"     LAUSANNE, Switzerland – Cristiano Ronaldo was fined 20,000 euros ($22,738) by UEFA on Thursday, March 21 (Friday, March 22, Manila time) for mimicking Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone’s crotch-grabbing celebration in Juventus’ Champions League last-16 win last week. The 34-year-old scored a second-leg hat-trick as the Italian champions overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit to progress to the quarterfinals. He replicated Simeone’s gesture after the first game by grasping his genitals and thrusting out his groin following his tie-winning penalty. Argentinian Simeone was also fined 20,000 euros by UEFA for his celebration, with European football’s governing body following suit in Ronaldo’s case. “He will have seen how I did it at the Wanda Metropolitano and, like me, was trying to show his character,” Simeone said after the match. Ronaldo, who returns to Portugal international duty after a nine-month absence later on Thursday, has scored 24 goals for Juventus since signing from Real Madrid for 100 million euros last year. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/226258-tugade-blocks-go-jek-entry-philippines-because-grab/","title":"Is Tugade blocking Go-Jek’s entry into the Philippines because of Grab?","date":"Mar 21, 2019 10:20 AM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) Transportation Assistant Secretary Goddes Libiran says Secretary Arthur Tugade is 'not a micromanager'","body":" (3rd UPDATE) Is the Department of Transportation (DOTr) deliberately blocking the entry of Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek in the Philippines?  Quoting a high-ranking government official, a source told Rappler that Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade supposedly said he will “not allow” the entry of Go-Jek in the Philippine market “until Grab recuperates” from its losses. On Thursday, March 21, Transportation Assistant Secretary Goddes Libiran told Rappler that Tugade does not intervene with LTFRB matters, despite being an attached agency. “Secretary [Tugade] is not a micromanager. When it comes to matters like that, he lets LTFRB to decide on their own,” Libiran told Rappler. “Palagi ako kasama ni Secretary [Tugade] sa mga meetings with the road sector, the LTFRB. Pero wala akong natatandaang may sinabi siyang ganyan,” she added. (I am always with Secretary Tugade during meetings with the road sector, the LTFRB. But I can’t remember a time when he said something like that.) Libiran said that Go-Jek can still appeal their case directly to the DOTr. “That’s when the Secretary will intervene,” she said. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) again rejected Go-Jek’s application as a transportation network company (TNC), through its local subsidiary Velox Technology Philippines, over the same foreign ownership issue. Go-Jek operates in 66 cities in Indonesia, and has recently expanded to Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is backed by deep-pocketed investors in the tech scene such as Google, Chinese technology giants Tencent and JD.com; as well as Singaporean investment company Temasek. In a text message to Rappler, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said that Velox is no longer foreign-owned but “still below the 60-40 requirement.” To qualify as a TNC, it should be 60% Filipino-owned. In March 2018, Grab bought the Southeast Asia operations of Uber, therefore having a “virtual monopoly” of the industry, as the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) previously said. In a statement on Friday, March 22, Grab Philippines said it had “willfully” invested over $164 million in the Philippines for its operations “while remaining faithful, compliant, and respectful to regulators and policy makers.” “We, in no way, undermine their mandate and the trust given to them by the President by seeking special preference or partisanship in favor of our business,” Grab said. “We will continue to demonstrate our compliance as a fair and law-abiding corporation operating in the Philippines. We encourage everyone – both existing and incoming market players – to remain faithful to the procedures and the regulations set by the government,” it added. Since Uber left, ride-hailing services patrons have complained about unserved bookings from Grab. Drivers also said they don’t receive as much incentives as when the California-based firm was still here. The acquisition was eventually approved by PCC, but the antitrust body slapped Grab Philippines with a P12-million fine for causing “undue” difficulties to the review. The PCC again fined Grab P6.5 million for violating its pricing commitments in January. Will the Philippine government ever allow Go-Jek to operate in the country? Let’s see. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/data-stories/225452-reasons-philippines-slow-adopt-e-wallet/","title":"Why the Philippines has been slow to adopt e-wallets","date":"Mar 18, 2019 6:42 PM PHT","snippet":"And why that's about to change","body":"{source}<style>@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {.spec-exec-logo {display: flex;align-items: center;flex-direction: column;margin-top: 5%;}.switch-image {display: block;box-sizing: border-box;background: url(https://assets.rappler.com/CDB62DF7E43945178309678473603825/img/1BFEC765D7DE4956BC6776050E8CFF9E/nerve_logo.png) no-repeat;width: 110px;height: 23px;background-size: 100% auto;}}@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {#cover-area > top-img > div { margin-top: 10% !important; margin-right: 40% !important; margin-left: 5% !important;}.switch-image {display: block;box-sizing: border-box;background: url(https://assets.rappler.com/39B80443B91542A2895BE9954E52BC85/img/385D1F66100F4AE09703485E308EE5CD/2.png) no-repeat;width: 130px;height: 27px;background-size: 100% auto;}.spec-exec-logo {text-align: left;width: 40%;margin-bottom: 5%;}#gysharebarh-225452 {text-align: left !important;}h1.spec-exec-headline {font-family: “Oswald”, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !important;}h1.spec-exec-headline, p.spec-exec-subhead, p.spec-exec-byline{text-align: left;}#cover-area > top-img > div > text-container > hr {margin-left: 0;width: 20% !important;height: 1px;}bg-image:before {content: ”;position: absolute;top: 0;right: 0;bottom: 0;left: 0;background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1));opacity: 1;z-index: 1;}#cover-area > top-img > div {z-index: 1;}}@media only screen and (min-width: 1025px) { #cover-area > top-img > div { margin-top: -10% !important; margin-right: 40% !important; margin-left: 5% !important;}}</style><script>$(‘#cover-area > top-img > div’).prepend(`<div class=”spec-exec-logo”><div class=”switch-image”></div></div>`);</script>{/source} Can you imagine the day when cash is obsolete and Filipinos use only their mobile phones to pay for everything, even the most mundane stuff like a jeepney ride or street food? It may seem like a scene straight out of the Netflix show Black Mirror, but it’s no longer science fiction. In China, cash is considered almost dead. Mobile payments have become so ubiquitous that even beggars are collecting handouts by apps. The country’s e-wallet giants, Alibaba-backed Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat, have 700 million and 1 billion monthly active users, respectively. That covers almost the entire China population, and a chunk of those numbers came only in the past 5 years. For comparison, Apple Pay, which comes pre-installed on every iPhone, has only 127 million users globally. The Philippines hasn’t come close to the dizzying adoption that China has seen (to be fair, though, probably no other country in the world has). Cash still accounted for 99% of local transactions as of 2018, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) earlier said. A poll by data insights company TheNerve confirmed that cash remains the preferred payment mode of Filipinos. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237783/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   On top of that, only 1.3% of Filipino adults own electronic money accounts, according to the BSP’s 2017 Financial Inclusion Survey. BSP’s own data pegs e-wallet accounts in the country at about 12% of the adult population.  {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239889/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   If we go by industry players’ claims, here’s how many e-wallet users we have: (Stats on other players are hard to come by.) The sum of those figures translates to just over 31% of the total population and this is how it compares to some of the Philippines’ neighbors:  China’s e-wallet success will be hard to replicate elsewhere, but there are many lessons that can be drawn from its experience. While the Philippines was slow to adopt mobile payments in the past, it’s likely reaching a tipping point, especially as Alibaba and Tencent export their expertise and technology here via their strategic tie-ups with GCash and PayMaya. China was uniquely primed for mobile payments For context, mobile payments leapfrogged in China because of insufficient banking infrastructure. The size of the country and its population meant consumers had to contend with long lines in city branches and long journeys to those in the countryside. Credit card usage was also low, partly because America’s Visa and Mastercard – and many other international firms – were banned in the Middle Kingdom. Mobile apps became a convenient way to transfer money and pay for goods and services. Widening internet and mobile phone penetration, and rising incomes were also prerequisites. China’s smartphone market took off when cheaper Chinese alternatives to the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy began to sprout. Today, smartphone adoption stands at 63%, while cellular subscription is 104 per 100 people in the country. The Philippine market’s fundamentals are quite similar to China’s early days. While the local market isn’t highly protectionist like China – and Visa and Mastercard are the two dominant credit card companies – cards have not seen that much take-up. It’s hard to get approved for a credit card if you don’t have any credit or banking history. With 77% of Filipinos unbanked, mobile payments offer the perfect case for people to sideswipe the plastic. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239880/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   Like China, the Philippines has a rising middle class and is touted as a mobile-first market, with smartphone adoption at 59%, thanks to affordable phones – a lot of which are made by Chinese brands themselves. Cellular subscription is at 110 per 100 people. Filipinos also spend the most time on the internet and social media among countries in the world. Facebook is practically their internet. As consumers become digitally savvy, they begin to browse and purchase goods and services online and on-the-go. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”http://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A/pinoys-smartphone.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   One roadblock perhaps is the country’s slow internet speed. It’s hard to create the habit of paying for goods anytime without a constant, stable connection, particularly in rural areas. Though the speed has improved, it still lags behind other Asia-Pacific countries. That can be blamed on a lack of internet infrastructure. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/CDB62DF7E43945178309678473603825/img/D9ECB2C6F0B342B5A20E16D6DB190406/asia-pacific-internet-speeds-akamai-q1-2017-report.png” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Source: Akamai Q1 2017 report” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Creating the habit of mobile payments through strong use cases To boost the user count of its eBay-like e-commerce platform Taobao, Alibaba in 2004 launched Alipay, which held payment in escrow until buyers received their online purchase. Providing users with a go-between and guarantor catapulted Taobao to massive popularity. Alibaba, which also owns business-to-consumer marketplace Tmall, is China’s most prolific e-commerce firm – the one responsible for the world’s biggest shopping holiday known as Single’s Day or 11.11. About a decade later, the escrow service was spun off as a separate company called Ant Financial to consolidate Alibaba’s various finance activities under one roof. Ant began to run mobile wallet Alipay as one of its units. By that time, Alipay already had a large user base. Since then, Alipay dominated roughly 80% of mobile payments in China, where 75% of online sales were expected to happen through smartphones by 2018. Till Tencent’s WeChat Pay entered the picture. If e-commerce was the driving force behind Alipay, WeChat Pay’s main weapon was social interaction. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/5CFB321FFDA24818BA79B19F4C1381F6/alipay-wechat.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   The payments service is integrated into the WeChat social app and responsible for all the transactions happening there. It launched riding on the back of China’s longtime tradition of gifting cash-stuffed red envelopes. On Lunar New Year in 2014, WeChat allowed its users to send a virtual version of the red envelopes to fellow users. The app quickly became a key method for people to send money to each other. That same year, WeChat made a big e-commerce leap by allowing any merchant – not just well-known retailers – to set up storefronts in its app under an open platform strategy. To defend its turf, Alipay followed suit. The rivalry only grew from there. The next battleground was China’s online-to-offline market (i.e. offline services being booked online) which saw the firms include a gamut of services into their apps. You name it, they have it: ride-hailing, food delivery, movie-ticket buying, etc. Payments were the glue that held their ecosystems together. By 2017, the firms had split the payments market: Alipay had a 54% share, while WeChat had 40%. They had become lifestyle “super apps” embedded in Chinese daily life. WeChat boasts of an unrivalled 1 billion active users network in China (to this day, Facebook has failed to leap over the Great Wall). The social aspect made it a lot stickier than Alipay and brought strong network effects, allowing it to catch up fast. The more users WeChat got on board, the more people wanted to join to be connected with their friends and families. And with more users came more sellers. The Philippines, however, has no homegrown brand as powerful as WeChat or Alipay that could spark that kind of awareness about mobile payments among Filipinos. The SIM-based payments services of Globe and PLDT (GCash and Smart Money, respectively) have been around since the early 2000s and the app versions (GCash and PayMaya) came starting 2012. Yet as of 2017, 40% of banked Filipinos were still unaware of electronic payment methods, according to the BSP Financial Inclusion Survey. That could partly explain the slow pace of adoption in previous years. Apart from lack of awareness, security is another concern. In TheNerve’s recent poll, most survey respondents said they don’t use mobile apps to pay. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237787/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   Most think mobile app payments are unsafe and that their money and personal details might get stolen. But of course, security concerns may have more to do with Filipinos’ inherent distrust of new financial technologies than the apps themselves (transactions with the top apps have proven secure thus far). The country has seen countless fraud incidents like ATM card skimming and online scams. So you can’t deny the appeal of dealing with a person – there’s someone to hold liable if the transaction goes wrong. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237788/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   E-commerce is a booming Philippine sector, posting a 42% surge in gross merchandise volume from $500 million in 2015 to $1.5 billion in 2018, according to a Google report. It’s expected to grow to $10 billion by 2025. Despite this, cash-on-delivery is still the number one way to pay for online purchases – similar to how China’s market started before Alipay was introduced. The escrow service was a game changer for China, specifically Alibaba’s Taobao, assuring users that they wouldn’t get cheated on the platform. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/70B431BAC541481CA2E2E3058DF1CDB6/ph-bank-notes-coins.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   In the Philippines, regional players Lazada – which was acquired by Alibaba in 2016 – and Shopee have been in a neck-and-neck race. Lazada’s payments feature, HelloPay, has merged with Alipay and rebranded to the latter. However, the companies said at the time that HelloPay’s features would be unchanged. It doesn’t seem like Lazada has adopted Alibaba’s escrow service, but it would help build trust among Filipino shoppers and push them into the habit of online payments if this happens. Local payments players will have to work much harder to hook consumers. These days, that means ads and integration with massive platforms like Facebook, cashback and other promos, as well as strong use cases. The marketing efforts will entail high cash burn, so players need substantial backing to last in the battle. Alibaba’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat play a key role, as they take their fight for dominance to other markets. Both have bankrolled their international expansion not just by targeting globe-trotting Chinese consumers, but also through investments in local markets. Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial (parent of Alipay) has made a major infusion in GCash’s parent Mynt and Tencent in PayMaya owner Voyager Innovations – both moves mean deeper know-how and capital to kick off the local apps’ aggressive growth. GCash and PayMaya started out with their telco groups’ core product – phone credit top-up (this made sense since the Philippines is a largely prepaid telco market) – money transfer, and bills payment. Now they’re gung-ho developing their own ecosystems of services. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/CA4037A87FC84A449D5F5C2B43A0593D/paymaya.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Other players with huge investor backing have also launched their bids to replicate China’s success. Ride-hailing company Grab has introduced GrabPay. Coins.ph, a blockchain-based e-wallet, has been acquired by Indonesia’s Go-Jek, Grab’s archrival that has its own payments feature called Go-Pay. Grab and Go-Jek are racing to become Southeast Asia’s leading super app that offers everyday services on-demand. All these companies have been flooding the market with promos to capture users. Here are some top e-wallet use cases, based on TheNerve’s survey: {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237789/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   Here’s the breakdown of e-money payments by key use case, as per BSP data: {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239908/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   QR codes are the way to go China’s tech giants are battling not just for online payments, but also offline transactions. Mobile wallets can’t win users if merchants don’t accept this kind of payment in-store. This is something that Alibaba and Tencent knew very well, so they’ve been slugging it out for brick-and-mortar shops, restaurants, and other offline outlets. They understood early on that sellers located outside cities might not be willing to accept mobile payments that would require them to shell out a big amount and upgrade equipment. In the US, many vendors had to migrate to payment terminals compatible with near-field communication tech or NFC to accept Apple Pay and Google Pay. The QR code is a black-and-white, two-dimensional barcode that stores data in codified format and can be read by a scanner or the camera of any mobile device. It’s a way to skip the step where the payer and payee’s account details must be inputted for a transaction to go through. The system is way cheaper than NFC and the traditional point-of-sale (POS) terminals or cash registers. Merchants in China could purchase a QR code scanner – commonly referred to as the “little white box” – for a quarter of the price of handheld POS terminals. Merchants without scanners can just print out a QR code that consumers can scan using their phones to pay. This means anyone can become a merchant since hardware isn’t necessary. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/CDB62DF7E43945178309678473603825/img/5A142193C0A34456920AC7DCA25EC452/qr-payment_1.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   It also means faster checkout time – no need to count bills and coins. Soon enough, QR code payments began taking China’s offline stores by storm. The technology has reached Philippine shores, raising the prospects of mobile payments finally taking off among vendors. A few months after Ant Financial’s investment in 2017, GCash introduced QR code payments. Not to be outdone by its competitor, PayMaya launched the feature on the same day. Before 2017, both e-wallet providers offered Visa and Mastercard prepaid cards that their users could use to pay at physical stores. So essentially only merchants with card terminals were able to accept the payments. The SIM-based mobile payment service, on the other hand, involved sending a text message with the amount and store’s code to a 4-digit access number. Lower fees are encouraging Another factor that should drive faster adoption of mobile payments is lower fees. In the US, Apple Pay and Google Pay don’t store money – instead, they work by charging directly to credit cards linked to the apps (the US is largely a card-based market). So it means those card firms take a percentage of each transaction from merchants. Alipay and WeChat are undercutting those card companies by giving users the ability to pay using their app balances, which can be sourced directly from bank accounts. This doesn’t mean no charges for merchants, though. Alipay takes a commission of 0.6% on sales, but that’s far lower than credit card commissions, which run between 1% and 5%. GCash and PayMaya work the same way as the China e-wallets, charging competitive rates. Both offer cash-in through physical stores. GCash alone offers the option to link and unlink bank accounts within the app. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/5B40E0F0A415438E86479274B2977572/gcash.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Users can also top up both GCash or PayMaya via the InstaPay option offered by banks. InstaPay is an electronic fund transfer service initiated by the BSP that allows people to transfer money almost instantly between accounts of participating BSP-supervised banks and non-bank e-money issuers in the Philippines. While going through InstaPay admittedly adds another step (users have to log into their bank app first), being able to wire money online and instantly will prove handy for consumers. InstaPay is one of the two automated clearing houses (ACH) for electronic fund transfers set up by the central bank under the National Retail Payment System. The aim is to promote interoperability among industry players so consumers can easily transfer money across different financial accounts. {source}<table border=”1″ style=”width:100%”> <tr> <td style=”padding: 1em; width: 20%; text-align: center;”>InstaPay</td> <td style=”padding: 1em;”> <ul> <li>Alternative to small-value cash payments</li> <li>Especially useful for purchasing retail goods, paying toll fees, and for e-commerce</li> <li>Limit: P50,000 per transaction</li> <li>Funds transferred get credited in real-time</li> <li>Enables merchants to accept e-payments from both e-money and bank accounts even without the usual point-of-sale device used for cards.

It employs a test-and-learn regulatory framework where players are relatively free to innovate. Among the things the central bank has allowed are: Will we ever get rid of cash? Clearly, the BSP sees the benefits of going cashless. Cash is costly to handle – you need to employ people to count, store or transport it, hence the fees banks charge consumers. It can also be dangerous to carry around. On the other hand, mobile app payments are quick and easy to scale, which translates to lower fees. They’re also transparent, as transactions are recorded electronically and can be tracked. With lower fees and simple know-your-customer procedures, the poor and unbanked could participate more broadly in the financial economy through the apps. What’s more, the apps provide a way for low-income households to save for emergencies and other needs, and for small businesses to access capital to grow. That’s why the central bank is doing its best to pave the way for a cash-lite society. It may be some way off, but experts believe the Philippines is on the cusp of a digital payments revolution. The BSP itself is optimistic that digital transactions could surge to 20% of total local payments by 2020.  Still, there are headwinds along the way. The promise of eliminating cash takes away the anonymity of every single transaction made. This is expected to be met with strong resistance from unscrupulous parties. It also brings about unsettling worries among consumers, given that volumes of their data are controlled by a few tech companies. With the vast amounts of personal information and transaction histories on Alipay, its parent Ant Financial has developed a proprietary platform called Sesame Credit, which calculates people’s credit scores based on that data. Ant then uses those scores in extending loans to consumers who are otherwise ignored by banks. China has a grand plan to implement a social credit scoring system that would judge its citizens’ behavior and trustworthiness. Concerns abound that it could access tech firms’ data, though the companies assert they won’t release it without users’ consent. A bad score could mean the loss of certain rights, such as boarding flights or riding the train. Again, it’s eerily reminiscent of the show Black Mirror, but that’s how the future may really be shaping up.

Maddie Madayag tallied 14 points as she led the Lady Eagles’ frontline. Kat Tolentino also played great on both ends, scoring 12 points and registering 14 digs. Ateneo head coach Oliver Almadro praised his team for responding well to his challenge to communicate better against a confident UP squad. “Mahirap ang game na ito kasi alam mo UP, high morale, they really played well, they really fought hard, but my players kasi they really seek deep inside them what they really want and iyon ang nangyari,” said Almadro. (This game was hard because we all know that UP has high-morale – they really played well, they really fought hard, but my players really seek what they really want deep inside them, and that’s exactly what happened.)  Tots Carlos emerged as the lone double-digit scorer for UP as she tallied 10 markers. The Lady Maroons dropped to 3-2 behind the three-way logjam of La Salle, University of Santo Tomas and Far Eastern University (4-2). Ateneo came out with a strong 8-4 start, but the Lady Maroons rallied back with a massive 8-2 run. However, a Tots Carlos attack error sparked an Ateneo 6-0 run that shifted the momentum and paved the way for the Lady Eagles to claim the opening frame.  The Lady Maroons absorbed another blow early in the 2nd set when Remelyn Altomea hurt her right ankle when Ateneo was up 6-3. Ateneno kept its distance, 20-15, and Ponggay Gaston carried the squad late in the 2nd frame with 3 straight points that awarded the Lady Eagles with the set win and a 2-0 match advantage. The 3rd set started pretty much the same with the Lady Eagles setting the tone early, 14-8. Although the Lady Maroons showed signs of life, tying the game several times, the Lady Eagles survived the late challenge behind Bea de Leon and Deanna Wong in the extended set and secured the victory to stretch their winning streak to 4 games. – Rappler.com      "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/225326-fiba-3x3-world-tour-berth-up-for-grabs-chooks-president-cup/","title":"FIBA 3×3 World Tour berth up for grabs in President’s Cup ","date":"Mar 9, 2019 4:53 PM PHT","snippet":"The champion of the 2019 Chooks-to-Go Pilipinas 3x3 President's Cup gets to represent the Philippines in the biggest 3x3 club tournament in the world","body":"        MANILA, Philippines – The stakes just got higher in the 2019 Chooks-to-Go Pilipinas 3×3 President’s Cup.  Besides having a pot prize of P 1,000,000 for the champion and two tickets to the first ever Asia-Pacific Super Quest for the top two placers, the winning team in the first conference will gain an automatic berth to the FIBA 3×3 World Tour – the biggest 3×3 club tournament in the world.

He was on intermittent leaves after being diagnosed with tongue cancer in February 2018, but kept a business-as-usual attitude. Despite his illness, he still tried to attend to the demanding task of being the BSP governor and took time to explain issues to reporters. He served for less than two years, but will forever be remembered as the central bank chief who was tough on violators, yet humble and soft-spoken. (READ: Bangko Sentral appoints Cyd Tuaño Amador as officer-in-charge) Support for the unbanked The banking community remembered Espenilla as a humble and unassuming man who pursued reforms throughout his stint in the BSP. Espenilla recognized that three-fourths of Filipinos do not have bank accounts, which led him to pursue inclusivity through financial technology or fintech.  The Bankers Association of the Philippines said Espenilla’s legacy and dedication will be a “foundation in building a stronger Philippine banking industry for future generations.” The Fintech Alliance of the Philippines described him as an “exemplary and transformational leader” who made “economic inclusion his mantra.” “He had the passion and dedication to bring about meaningful change to the unbanked and underserved Filipinos through enabling regulations and policies,” the group said. Espenilla’s actions led to the development of new products. “Governor Espenilla leaves a proud legacy of having promoted financial technology and inclusive financial services in the Philippines, including the GrabPay e-wallet. We are very grateful for the support that was given to Grab,” said Brian Cu, Grab Philippines president. Francis Lim, president of the Shareholders’ Association of the Philippines (SharePHIL), said Espenilla “will be remembered for his role in crafting regulatory policies to create a stronger and more responsive banking system through good governance, proper risk management, greater financial disclosure and increased capitalization.” “He supported our cause for financial literacy and championed the proper use of technology to promote financial inclusion.  I have had the honor of knowing him as a friend and his humility amidst the accolades that were bestowed on him and his sense of humor in the midst of challenges in his work and health were worth emulating,” Lim said in a statement. ‘Bad cop’ Prior to his appointment as BSP governor, he handled the supervision and examination department which was tasked to clamp down on rogue financial institutions. Among his feats was getting the BSP to close Banco Filipino in 2011. Espenilla’s team found evidence of depositors’ money leaking into entities controlled by the owners and officers. “Even during my presidency, Nesting Espenilla showed exemplary leadership as BSP deputy governor for the very sensitive Supervision and Examination Sector. I take pride in his accomplishments during my term, as I salute him for his work in the Duterte administration, and I extend my respectful condolences to his family,” Pampanga 2nd District Representative Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said. He also slapped a whopping P1-billion fine on the Yuchengco-led Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation due to the $81-million bank heist. “As we express our condolences to the family, friends, colleagues, and loved ones of Governor Espenilla, we express our gratitude to the man once in charge of disciplining banks for his complete devotion to his work and great service to the nation,” Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said. Policy reforms Espenilla’s 37 years of experience in the banking sector and his policy stance to stabilize the economy earned him mostly praises than raised eyebrows. He pushed for reducing the reserve requirement ratio or the cash banks must hold. He believed the money would be better used as loans. However, this endeavor also came at a time when the Philippines experienced inflation rates not seen in almost a decade.  While most factors were supply-based and mostly out of Espenilla’s control, the central bank pushed through with raising interest rates by 175 basis points to temper inflation expectations. Philippine Competition Commission Chairperson Arsenio Balisacan said Espenilla and his predecessor, Amando Tetangco Jr, led the BSP and the Monetary Board so well, that the economy has “seen its longest episode of growth in the postwar period.” Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said Espenilla was a big loss to the BSP and the country, and an “exemplar of a dedicated public servant with high competence and integrity.” United States Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim also extended condolences to Espenilla’s wife Tess and the rest of his family. “We remember the governor for his passion and integrity, and recognize his decades of service to the Philippines,” Kim said. British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce likewise expressed his condolences to Espenilla’s loved ones. “He was a great partner of the UK, an inspiring professional and above all a generous, warm, and friendly man. May he rest in peace,” said Pruce. Public viewing began at 3:30 pm on Monday, February 25, at the Heritage Park in Taguig City.

The critically acclaimed film on Sunday, February 24 snatched the coveted best picture Oscar to wrap up the Academy Awards – a bit of an upset over Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma, which had been the heavy favorite. The top prize was the third statuette of the night for Green Book, which earned a total of 5 nominations. Mahershala Ali won the best supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of pianist Don Shirley, who strikes up an unlikely friendship with driver Tony “Lip” Vallelonga (best actor nominee Viggo Mortensen). The film also won for best original screenplay. “The whole story is about love. It’s about loving each other, despite our differences, and finding out the truth about who we are – we’re the same people,” said director Peter Farrelly. Green Book bested 7 other films for top honors: Roma, superhero flick Black Panther, Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman, Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, offbeat royal romp The Favourite, musical romance A Star Is Born, and Dick Cheney biopic Vice. The film – co-written by Vallelonga’s son, Nick – explores race relations and identity as Shirley embarks on the tour and is forced to rely on his initially racist, ill-mannered Italian-American driver. Mortensen put on 45 pounds (20 kilograms) to play Vallelonga, a family man whose opinions evolve as the film unfolds. The two men learn from each other as they confront stereotypes about themselves and others. Shirley and Lip remained friends – they both died in 2013. The feel-good movie is named after The Negro Motorist Green Book, an annual guidebook that provided African-Americans advice on safe places to eat and sleep while travelling during segregation. An audience favorite, it racked up a number of accolades in the run-up to the Oscars, including a best musical/comedy film award at the Golden Globes and the top prize from the Producers Guild of America. Ali received numerous statuettes as well as his Oscar, including a Golden Globe, a Bafta and a Screen Actors Guild award. ‘White savior movie’  But while the film has proven a crowd-pleaser, it has been embroiled in controversy since its premiere. Shirley’s relatives, including his brother, have objected to the storyline, saying they were never consulted and have denounced the film as a “symphony of lies.” Shirley’s niece, Carol Shirley Kimble, blasted the movie as a “depiction of a white man’s version of a black man’s life.” The film also became part of a wider debate in the United States about race, with many describing it as yet another “white savior movie” told through the lens of its white protagonist. “The Green Book is a black story and for a white man to steal that legacy and name for a film that has little or nothing to do with The Green Book is unacceptable,” Oscar-winning director Roger Ross Williams said in a Facebook post. “We have always had our stories and our history stolen from us and told through the lens of whiteness and this film is Hollywood’s latest example.” Vallelonga has defended his work, saying it was based on stories his father told him about the tour. He also says Shirley advised him before his death not to speak to anyone else about his project. “We were aware of the certain tropes, like the white savior trope – the white guy saves the black guy – as well as the black savior trope – the black guy saves the white guy,” Farrelly told Newsweek in November. “We were careful not to make this film either of those.” But then Farrelly and Nick Vallelonga attracted negative headlines themselves – the director for an apparent dirty practical joke he used to pull on sets, and Vallelonga for an anti-Muslim tweet. Both apologized – and it seems that Oscar voters have forgiven them. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/224254-men-volleyball-games-results-feu-unbeaten-february-24-2019/","title":"Unbeaten FEU grabs solo UAAP men’s volleyball lead","date":"Feb 24, 2019 2:32 PM PHT","snippet":"The Tamaraws survive the Blue Eagles' tough challenge for a 3-0 start, while the Tigers roll to a second win versus the Maroons","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Far Eastern University (FEU) Tamaraws rolled to their third straight triumph to remain as the lone undefeated team in the UAAP Season 81 men’s volleyball tournament.

Fake news,' he tells reporters at Government House about the speculation of an impending coup","body":"BANGKOK, Thailand – Thailand’s junta chief on Monday, February 11, dismissed rumors of an impending coup as “fake news,” as speculation ricocheted across a kingdom unsettled by the ill-fated political union between a princess and a party allied to the powerful Shinawatra clan. Conjecture has coursed through Thailand since Friday when the Thai Raksa Chart party proposed Princess Ubolratana, King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s elder sister, as a candidate for premier after the March 24 election. Hours later, a royal command from the king appeared to put a pin in her unprecedented political aspirations. It said the monarchy was above politics and described his sister’s candidacy as “highly inappropriate.” The slapdown by an unassailable monarch – protected by some of the world’s harshest royal defamation laws – who has never addressed the public in such strong terms, set off a chain reaction. A chastened Thai Raksa Chart, a key pillar in the election strategy of billionaire ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, swiftly agreed to comply with the command. Election authorities meeting Monday are expected to discuss whether the use of the princess’s name was unconstitutional, a first step towards dissolving the party. Adding to the uncertainty, chatter of an impending coup against the ruling junta leader Prayut Chan-O-Cha and a major change in army top brass has billowed out, with the hashtag #coup trending in the top 10 in Thai Twitter. But on Monday the gruff former general, who masterminded a putsch against the government of Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin’s sister, in 2014, tried to stop it short. “Rumors…? We’re investigating. Fake news,” he told reporters at Government House about the merits of the speculation. Coups and plots Thailand’s generals have a penchant for coups, backroom plotting and factional struggles.  They have grabbed power 12 times since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, including against existing juntas seen to have over-stepped their mark.  Prayut, a gruff ex-army chief turned junta head, has agreed to stand for premier after the election and is aided by an army-scripted constitution. But critics say he has personalized power and outstayed his welcome with a public wearied by his finger-jabbing style. The king appointed a new army chief, Apirat Kongsompong, last year from a rival faction of the army to Prayut and his junta allies. Recent days have seeded unease, with the first election in 8 years now seemingly dependent on behind-the-scenes power plays by the elite. “Pls#NoMoreCoup WTF with this country,” said one Twitter user, while another said “I wish we have only #election2019.” Meanwhile, the fate of Thai Raksa Chart hangs in the balance.  The party, a second to the Thaksin political powerhouse Pheu Thai, was expected to help the Shinawatra machine secure a majority in the 350-seat lower house. But it is under intense pressure following its bid to bring in the princess. “I think the party leader and board should take a responsibility by resigning,” said Srisuwan Janya of the Association for the Protection of the Constitution, a royalist activist group, who submitted a petition to election authorities Monday calling for the party’s censure. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/lifestyle-and-entertainment/223154-free-chocolates-serenades-promo-codes-grab-valentines/","title":"Free chocolates, serenades, promo codes, and more from Grab this Valentine’s Day","date":"Feb 10, 2019 6:16 PM PHT","snippet":"Single?

Navigatú, taken from the word “navigation” and inspired by Butuan’s “balangay” boats, offers an idea incubation program and business skills course for startups in the region. Just recently, Navigatu acquired P2 million in funding from an investor. Aside from providing a safer commuting alternative for the public, the application also hopes to increase the income of tricycle drivers. Users can quickly book a ride with a few taps, while Transeek will search for the nearest available tricycle using GPS (Global Positioning System). (READ: IN PHOTOS: How new jeepneys, buses, tricycles could look like) Not alone in solving transport woes The Philippines knows its fair share of public transportation problems, as well as proposed methods of harnessing technology and data to address the said issues.  Ride-hailing platforms like Grab, Wunder, and Angkas make it clear their services aim to serve commuters readily in a bid to solve the city’s all-too familiar gridlock. The effectiveness at which they do a good job is still arguable though, with recent studies seeming to suggest a different set of issues arises. In Pangasinan, ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines also launched a premium service for tricycles, in partnership with AutoItalia Philippines, aiming to “fill in the gap for short-distance commutes.” (READ: LOOK: Grab launches premium tricycle service) Transeek aims to uplift A survey of 100 tricycle drivers in Butuan found their average income ranged from P400 to P500 a day. Transeek hopes to increase their income up to 300% by helping in decreasing delays and standby hours. The base fare for a maximum of 3 passengers per ride will be P30, with a service charge of P5. Drivers will get P25 for every ride from the system. “We have interviewed drivers during Tricycle Operators and Drivers’ Association (TODA) meetings and most of them liked Transeek since they don’t have to waste time roaming around to look for passengers,” said Cubillas. According to the app makers, drivers’ registration into Transeek’s system will be free. They will be required to comply with insurance requirements, however – something most of them fail to adhere to. (WATCH: [Right of Way] Why the PH doesn’t have enough mass transport options) In 2017, several bills such as senate Bill 1284 and House Bill 4334, sought to modernize the transport sector, though they remain pending. Navigatú on board  “Because of Navigatú, we were exposed to ideation, pitching and marketing activities we never had in classrooms. It helped improve my potentials for business,” said Cagulada. (WATCH: Why is it important to #HackSociety?) Transeek’s team is among the first batch of “incubatees” from the program, alongside 6 other teams developing local IT solutions for agriculture and micro, small, and medium enterprises. Facilities such as computer units and administrative functions are provided for free by Navigatú, enabling them to develop their startup ideas.  “Before, we just made IT systems because we like it. Now, it’s more (about) solving problems or helping improve lives,” explained Cubillas.  Engr. Jeffrey Dellosa, Navigatú Project Leader and CSU’s Innovation and Technology Support Office manager, said they are trying to provide an ecosystem in the university that would enable students – and anyone else who might be interested – to transform their ideas into businesses that will generate solutions to existing societal problems.

Grab Philippines recently introduced their new leadership structure, with country head-turned-president Brian Cu still at the helm of the ride-hailing giant. Lawyer Nicka Hosaka, the newest public affairs manager, will be working with its head Leo Gonzales. Before joining Grab, Hosaka served as the chief of staff and legal counsel of PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe from April 2017 to May 2018. After her stint with the PCC, she became the legal counsel for e-commerce platform Shopee for about 6 months. Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations in March 2018 prompted the PCC to review the deal. It bound the ride-hailing firm to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments. Compliance monitoring is still ongoing, with the antitrust body imposing another P6.5-million fine on Grab for violating its commitments to the PCC. Conflict of interest?  Section 7 (b)(1) of Republic Act No. 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees does not allow government workers to: Own, control, manage or accept employment as officer, employee, consultant, counsel, broker, agent, trustee or nominee in any private enterprise regulated, supervised or licensed by their office unless expressly allowed by law The law states that it “shall continue for a period of one year after resignation, retirement, or separation of office.” In an interview with Rappler, Bernabe said Hosaka is “not covered” by the rule. There’s no conflict of interest, he said, with Hosaka being with Grab now. Bernabe explained that despite reviewing the Grab-Uber buyout, the PCC is neither regulating nor supervising Grab. (READ: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?) Bernabe also added that the PCC did not give Grab the license to operate because that falls under the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. “The code of conduct is not applicable in this case. In terms of optics it might create, Nicka never worked on the Grab case. She was never part of the team that conducted the review,” Bernabe said. The commissioner also said that Hosaka had already left the PCC when the antitrust watchdog was reviewing Grab’s voluntary commitments. “Nicka is a very good lawyer and she was a very good staff member. We trust that she will not be involved in anything still pending with the PCC. That’s a commitment she made when she went to Shopee,” Bernabe told Rappler. No work overlap Bernabe expects Hosaka to be hands-off the Grab-Uber deal in terms of lending her legal expertise.  “That’s our expectation. Out of sense of propriety or delicadeza,” Bernabe. Hosaka, in an interview with Rappler, maintained that there is “no conflict whether legal or personal” with her new role in Grab. “In so far as the transaction was concerned, it was ongoing but it just started when I left. I wasn’t involved in the review team. I wasn’t even part of any discussions with the parties with Grab or Uber,” she said. When she first met with the ride-hailing giant, Hosaka said she had informed Bernabe of the role. She said the height of the Grab-Uber buyout issue was when she was at Shoppee. “Now, I am working with [Grab’s] public affairs team. With the PCC, I was acting as chief of staff and was doing some legal counsel work for Commissioner Bernabe. There’s no overlapping in terms of duties and obligations there,” she said. Hosaka assured that she will not be handling any PCC-related matter while she’s working with Grab. “Right now, while I’m with Grab, Im not handling any PCC matters, also because out of propriety. We don’t want to taint anything, even if I am not privy in terms of the Grab-Uber transaction itself,” she said. “Just for propriety and professionalism, I’m not handling any PCC matters,” she added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/222521-grab-philippines-prohibit-campaign-ad-car/","title":"Grab Philippines prohibits election campaign ads on cars","date":"Feb 2, 2019 1:31 PM PHT","snippet":"'We request the public to reach out to us for any sightings of these vehicles,' says Grab Philippines public affairs head Leo Gonzales","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Have you ever hopped on a Grab ride with political campaign advertisements plastered on it?

When Grab bought Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, the PCC warned of a “virtual monopoly” on the industry, therefore binding the ride-hailing firm to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments. “We fined P6.5 million on Grab Philippines for submitting deficient, inconsistent, and incorrect data for the monitoring of its compliance with its voluntary commitments,” said PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan on Friday, January 25. He said that Grab should be able to submit “correct, sufficient, consistent, and timely” data to be able to monitor pricing commitments. (READ: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?) PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe explained that the failure to submit the needed data “prevented the PCC and the 3rd party body’ from monitoring the pricing commitments. The data to be submitted should be able to determine whether Grab fares deviated from its usual pricing after Uber left. The decision was issued Tuesday, January 22 but Grab received it on Wednesday, January 23. The PCC said Grab should submit the necessary data 5 days after receipt of the order which will be on Monday, January 28. The ride-hailing giant has until February 7 to file a motion for reconsideration on the fine. The PCC approved the Grab-Uber deal but bound Grab to commitments, as if Uber were still operating in the Philippines. It chose top UK audit firm Smith & Williamson to monitor Grab’s compliance. In October 2018, the anti-trust body had fined both Grab and Uber a combined P16 million for causing “undue difficulties” in the review of the acquisition deal. ‘We will appeal’ Grab Philippines in a statement Friday afternoon, January 25, said it will file a motion for reconsideration on the penalty. The ride-hailing giant said that it was “working under very limited timelines” to meet PCC’s deadline on the required pricing data after the Uber buyout. “Three out of 4 penalties were set at a maximum amount of P2 million pesos each. Given the breakdown of the fines vis-a-vis the severity of the lapses alleged by the PCC, we would like to better understand PCC’s rationale for imposing a maximum penalty,” Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said. PCC said that Grab “did not have a complete set of historical pricing coefficient” which will be used to determine whether Grab fares deviated from its usual pricing after Uber left. PCC said “this was not made known” to them by the ride-hailing giant. In response, Grab said that it will reconcile their data structure with the PCC, “given enough time.” Grab assured that it is charging fares “within the range” allowed by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/220604-china-attacking-crisis-vs-philippines-asian-cup-2019/","title":"China faces attacking crisis ahead of Asian Cup match vs Azkals","date":"Jan 9, 2019 7:19 PM PHT","snippet":"Coach Marcello Lippi says China is 'not certain' if injured star Wu Lei will suit up against the Philippines","body":"     AI AIN, United Arab Emirates – Even after China secured a 2-1 win over Kyrgyzstan that catapulted it to the top of Group C, Team Dragon finds itself in serious trouble with a possible injury to star forward Wu Lei.  The Chinese Super League topscorer – reportedly linked with Premier League outfit Wolverhampton Wanderers last year – remained doubtful for the team’s second Group C clash against the Philippines on Friday, January 11 due to a suspected collarbone injury. (READ: Azkals look to ‘get out’ of 2019 Asian Cup group stage) “I really hope not,” said China head coach Marcello Lippi, when asked if the injury was serious. “I hope he’ll be available (against the Philippines) but it’s not certain.” China continued to have threadbare options in the attacking third as makeshift forward Yu Dabao came off the bench in the 24th minute to net the winner in the 78th minute over debutant Kyrgyzstan.  Yu played as a defender last season for Beijing Guoan as Lippi said overseas forwards flooding the cashed-up Chinese Super League have squeezed out Chinese players, which he believed could damage their Asian Cup campaign.  “This shows our situation in China. In China, nearly all the foreign players are forwards,” said Lippi, who led his native Italy to the 2006 World Cup title. “It means for our attack, I have to pick a player who spent the season in central defense.” The Philippine Azkals remained at the bottom of Group C, but shocked the tournament by conceding only one goal to Asian powerhouse South Korea.  Lippi was proven right with China’s unconvicing start to the Asian Cup against Kyrgyzstan – which led at halftime and should have grabbed at least a draw if not for a bungling own goal by its goalkeeper in the 50th minute.  Defensively, Team Dragon was continually picked apart by an inventive Kyrgyzstan, who dominated the 1st half and had chances for a late equalizer. Alexandre Pato, Hulk and Oscar are among the well-paid foreign attacking players in China, where football authorities have tried to clamp down on expensive new arrivals by imposing a heavy tax on transfer fees and a salary cap. However, Lippi was also a beneficiary of the trend during his time at Guangzhou Evergrande, when the likes of Dario Conca, Elkeson and Muriqui inspired the club to 4 CSL titles and the 2013 Asian Champions League crown. Goal-shy China scored just 5 goals in their 6 friendlies since September and Lippi revealed he gave his players a halftime rocket after a typically slow start against Kyrgyzstan. “It’s not the first time. In the two-and-a-half years I’ve been the national team coach, it’s happened many times that we’ve played a negative 1st half,” he said. “I start to get angry and push my players, and then I get the reaction that I wanted from the first minute. It seems like it’s a characteristic of Chinese players.” – with reports from Agence France-Presse/ Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/220609-toronto-raptors-denver-nuggets-grab-narrow-wins-golden-state-warriors-cruise/","title":"Raptors, Nuggets grab narrow wins as Warriors cruise","date":"Jan 9, 2019 3:24 PM PHT","snippet":"The Raptors pull off a scrappy win over the Hawks to stay ahead of the NBA race with a 31-12 record","body":"   LOS ANGELES, USA – The Toronto Raptors kept the pressure on in the NBA East race as Serge Ibaka’s late dunk made the difference in a scrappy 104-101 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday, January 8 (Wednesday, January 9, Manila time).  There was late drama also for Western Conference leaders Denver in Miami, where Nuggets star Nikola Jokic capped another triple-double with a go-ahead floater in the waning seconds in the visitors’ 103-99 victory. And it was close in Oklahoma City, where the Minnesota Timberwolves edged the Thunder 119-117 in Ryan Saunders’ first game as Minnesota’s interim coach after Tom Thibodeau was abruptly fired on Sunday. Toronto coach Nick Nurse, whose Raptors improved to a league-leading 31-12 – one game in front of Milwaukee in the East – admitted it was tough going in a game in which the Raptors and Hawks combined for 46 turnovers. “We pulled one out,” Nurse said. “We were trying to get away from them and we never could. We were down late there and had to make a couple stops and a couple scores and we did both of those things – so, pretty good.” Kawhi Leonard led Toronto with 31 points. His sixth steal of the night led to Ibaka’s dunk with 17.1 seconds left, which put the Raptors up 102-101. A rebound by Ibaka on Atlanta’s next possession led to a dunk by OG Anunoby for the final margin. {source} <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” data-lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>31 PTS. 6 AST. 6 STL.<br><br> <a href=”https://twitter.com/kawhileonard?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>@kawhileonard</a> gets it done on both ends to fuel the <a href=”https://twitter.com/Raptors?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>@Raptors</a> win over ATL! <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeTheNorth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#WeTheNorth</a> <a href=”https://t.co/KJIYb6QF8n”>pic.twitter.com/KJIYb6QF8n</a></p>&mdash; NBA (@NBA) <a href=”https://twitter.com/NBA/status/1082887192731561986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>January 9, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src=”https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script> {/source}   In Miami, the Heat led by 6 with 5:27 to play, but Jokic’s 29 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for Denver were ultimately too much for the hosts to overcome. He drove through traffic to swish in the basket that put the Nuggets up 101-99 with 2.4 seconds left and Jamal Murray added two free throws to complete the scoring. “The floater is kind of my game,” Jokic said. “I love that shot because I cannot dunk. It was a little bit more tight. (Bam) Adebayo was right there, I got a heavy knee in my charley horse. We won the game – that’s the most important thing.” Denver improved to 27-12 and remained one game in front of two-time defending champions Golden State, who cruised to a 122-95 victory over the New York Knicks in Oakland, California. Golden State star Klay Thompson’s 43 points included 7 three-pointers. Stephen Curry chipped in 14 points and 14 assists and Kevin Durant had 24 points, 6 assists and 6 rebounds as the Warriors snapped a three-game home skid. Noel hurt in Thunder loss   In Oklahoma City, Minnesota’s Andrew Wiggins scored a season-high 40 points and pulled down 10 rebounds to lead the Timberwolves to victory in a game marred by a frightening fall for Thunder center Nerlens Noel. (READ: Thunder’s Noel stretchered off after scary fall) Noel took an elbow to the face as he defended a driving Wiggins and crashed to the court, appearing to smack his head on the hardwood.

Thunder coach Billy Donovan said after the game that Noel had been hospitalized but gave no details on the player’s condition. Amid the tension that followed Noel’s fall, Russell Westbrook gave the Thunder a 115-114 lead with 1:14 left to play.  But Josh Okogie’s three-pointer with 26.8 seconds left put Minnesota up 119-115 and Westbrook missed two three-point attempts in the waning seconds that would have put Oklahoma City in front. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/220550-grab-philippines-adds-restaurants-food-delivery-menu/","title":"Grab adds 12 restaurants in its food delivery menu","date":"Jan 8, 2019 7:55 PM PHT","snippet":"Here are the international and homegrown food chains now part of GrabFood","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Heads up, foodies!

It also said that De Guzman’s family will “move forward with the ongoing court case” against both drivers involved in the crash.  “Grab will continue to cooperate with the authorities to help speed up the investigation of the case and to seek justice for Marko,” said the statement.

The Dallas Cowboys joined the New Orleans Saints, Los Angeles Rams and Chicago in the National Conference playoffs while New England and Houston joined Kansas City and the Los Angeles Chargers in the American Conference playoffs, leaving 4 playoff spots up for grabs. New England became the first team in NFL history to reach the playoffs for 10 consecutive seasons as the Patriots beat Buffalo, 24-12, but Tom Brady threw for only 126 yards and a touchdown, sparking injury fears for the 41-year-old quarterback, a five-time Super Bowl winner. “I feel great. I feel 100%. I’m not injured,” Brady said. “We didn’t have our best passing day. But we won, so I think everybody is feeling pretty good.” The Patriots captured their 10th consecutive AFC East division title, a feat matched only in North American sports by baseball’s Atlanta Braves, and 16th in 18 seasons. Touchdown runs by James White and Sony Michel gave the Patriots a 14-0 half-time lead and Brady tossed a 32-yard touchdown pass to Julian Edelman to thwart a Bills rally as New England (10-5) improved to 7-0 at home this season. At Dallas, Dak Prescott threw for one touchdown and ran for another while Jaylon Smith returned a fumble 69 yards for a touchdown to power the Cowboys over Tampa Bay 27-20 and clinch a third NFC East crown for Dallas in 5 seasons. Prescott connected on 20-of-25 passes for 161 yards and Ezekiel Elliott ran 18 times for 85 yards as the Cowboys improved to 9-6. “We have a very tough defense that gives offenses hell every week. We’re a tough, gritty offense – I think the sky is the limit for us,” Elliott said.   Eagles edge Texans Philadelphia’s Nick Foles threw for a club-record 471 yards and 4 touchdowns to lift the Eagles over Houston visiting Houston 32-30 to sustain their hopes of becoming the first back-to-back Super Bowl winner since New England in 2004 and 2005. Houston’s DeShaun Watson ran for two touchdowns and threw for two more, the last of them a 35-yarder to Vyncint Smith with 2:04 remaining that put the Texans ahead. The Eagles answered by marching 72 yards in 11 plays and Jake Elliott kicked a 35-yard field goal on the last play to give Philadelphia the victory. Philadelphia (8-7) remained just behind Minnesota (8-6 with one draw) in the NFC wildcard playoff fight after the Vikings won 27-9 at Detroit. Seattle (8-6) could capture an NFC wildcard playoff berth with a victory later Sunday over Kansas City.   Saints defeat Steelers New Orleans kept the NFL’s best record at 13-2 but only after a 31-28 nail-biter over visiting Pittsburgh that wasn’t sealed until Saints linebacker Denario Davis recovered a fumble in the final seconds to kill the final Steelers’ drive. “It was a battle,” Saints quarterback Drew Brees said. “We’re battle tested. We’ve had a lot of these this year and every one of them I feel has molded us and made us stronger. I love finding out how we’re going to win each week.” The victory ensured the Saints will play at home throughout the playoffs, a distinct edge in the noisy Superdome. “We love our home, we love the dome,” Brees said. “But we understand every time we step on the field, we have to earn it.” With the loss, Pittsburgh slid out of a playoff berth entering the final week of the season, replaced by Baltimore atop the AFC North and Indianapolis for a wildcard spot. Andrew Luck flipped a 1-yard touchdown pass to Chester Rogers with 55 seconds remaining to give Indianapolis a 28-27 victory at the New York Giants.

On Monday, December 17, Manila time, the country won its 4th crown courtesy of Filipino-Australian beauty queen Catriona Gray, who bested 93 other candidates for the top plum. Cheers all over the country erupted as Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters of South Africa placed the Mikimoto crown on her head. Catriona’s win came 7 days before Christmas, leaving Filipinos with something to celebrate. (IN PHOTOS: Catriona Gray wins Miss Universe 2018) Her much-talked-about “lava” walk made headlines, as it went viral after the preliminary competition. Pageant fans (and some candidates) even tried to imitate the twirl during the competition. Fashion bloggers and magazines raved about her evening gowns by designer Mak Tumang as they depicted stories from Filipino literature. (READ: What you need to know about Catriona Gray’s ‘Ibong Adarna’-inspired evening gown)  Three days later, she returned to Manila where she was met by screaming fans and the media who tried to ambush her for interviews as she made her way to a press conference sponsored by former Ilocos Sur governor Luis “Chavit” Singson’s group. She was in town for a charity event, which she graced on Thursday, December 20, as she went to an orphanage to donate toys for kids and a check on behalf of the Miss Universe Organization. (READ: Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray on the importance of giving this Christmas)  Clearly, the nation was bursting with happiness with her win. But it was not all merry as some netizens frowned on her answer during the final Q&A, pointing out that she “romanticized” poverty. (READ: ‘Problematic, romanticized:’ Netizens hit Catriona Gray’s winning answer) Filipino pageant enthusiasts believe that Catriona’s win shows that women joining beauty contests today is not just about having beautiful faces but also about having the brains. However, some still believe that the purpose of pageants is outdated and that they still objectify women who show of their toned bodies in swimsuits. So the debate and purpose of beauty pageants in the Philippines continues. Does it empower women or does it objectify them? History of pageantry  History shows that Filipinos’ love for pageantry can be traced back to the Santacruzan which was a celebration in honor of the search for the Holy Cross by Helena of Constantinople. During the American occupation, the concept of the carnival queen was introduced. The carnival queen was part of a project to strengthen the friendship between the Philippines and the US. After World War II, a contest was held for an airline company. This contest would lead to a chapter on the Filipinos’ growing fascination with pageants. In 1964, Binibining Pilipinas Charities Inc (BPCI) was established. The group is headed by the first Miss International, Stella Marquez of Colombia (she later married Jorge Araneta of the Philippines). BPCI is responsible for picking the ladies to be sent to Miss Universe and Miss International beauty pageants. It also does charity work. The love for pageantry started to grow with the establishment of the Miss Universe pageant in 1952. Finland’s Armi Kuusela, became the first Miss Universe. She would later on have ties with the Philippines, marrying Filipino businessman Virgilio Hilario after her reign. But in 1969, the Filipinos’ fascination with Miss Universe changed forever. Aside from the first man landing on the moon and the advancement of television, the country produced its first winner – Gloria Diaz, who later went on to become an actress. Prior to Gloria, Gemma Cruz won Miss International in 1964. Their respective wins would be replicated in the ’70s courtesy of Aurora Pijuan (1970) and Melanie Marquez (1979) for Miss International.  Four years after Gloria, Margarita “Margie” Moran won Miss Universe in 1973. Their wins would cement the country’s love for the pageant. Filipinos continued to be glued to television as Filipino representative after representative went abroad to compete in various pageants. Precious Lara Quigaman gave hope to the country once more in 2005 when she won Miss International. In 2010, Venus Raj ushered in what everyone calls another “golden era” for Philippine pageantry. She went on to bag the 4th runner-up position in Miss Universe. Her placements would be replicated by the likes of Shamcey Supsup (Miss Universe 2011 3rd runner-up), Janine Tugonon (Miss Universe 2012 1st runner-up), and Ariella Arida (Miss Universe 2013 3rd runner-up). Mary Jean Lastimosa, Maxine Medina, and Rachel Peters would end up as either part of the Top 10 or Top 6. After 42 years, the Philippines was in the spotlight once more when Pia Wurtzbach took home the country’s 3rd Miss Universe crown in 2015. Despite a mistake by host Steve Harvey, Filipino fans saw Pia’s reign as something unforgettable. She was taken in a motorcade around Manila and became a topic everywhere she went. Her stints as an advocate for HIV/AIDS awareness and showbiz duties were monitored and scrutinized by the public. Other queens were not forgotten. The year 2013 saw the country’s first Miss World courtesy of Megan Young. A 5th Miss International title was won by Bea Rose Santiago and Mutya Datul got the first Miss Supranational crown. In 2014, Jamie Herrell won Miss Earth and a back-to-back win happened in 2015, thanks to Angelia Ong. The year 2016 also saw a 6th title in the Miss International pageant courtesy of Kylie Verzosa, while in 2017, Karen Ibasco grabbed the 4th Miss Earth crown.  The Philippines was no doubt Asia’s powerhouse in pageantry, thanks to the wins of these ladies. The country would win crowns one after the other, either as a main winner or a runner-up. Pageant training Credit goes to the changes that have been made. Ladies competing used to be sent abroad for training in Colombia or Venezuela. But with the establishment of the beauty pageant camps, this has changed. Rodgil Flores – the man behind Kagandahang Flores and the one who trained the likes of Bea Rose Santiago, Jamie Herrell, Angelia Ong, and Karen Ibasco – said that they adopted the rules they got from watching the ladies of Venezuela. That country has produced many titleholders under pageant coach and mentor Osmel Sousa. “It’s always like that right? You get the best practices from those who have succeeded. That was the inspiration for it. It’s not in a way copying it, but what I mean is, when you are passionate about your craft, you’re passionate about fielding girls in national pageants, eventually international pageants. Of course, you research, you study. The successful story was Venezuela at that time. You see that they have the proper training. And we kind of adopted that,” Flores said in a mix of English and Filipino. Flores would coach his wards in the evenings. He is known for training the ladies in the “duck” walk, which is part swaying their hips as part of the exercise.  Adam Genato, writer and correspondent for Sash Factor, a website dedicated to beauty pageants, also pointed out the importance of pageant camps. He said that Filipinas have become fighters when competing for a crown. “Because before, if you compared it to the last decade… I’m basing it from Miss Universe, most of our delegates this decade wanted to up their notch when it came to their A game in Miss Universe,” Genato said. “Credit goes to the camps of these girls as to why they’ve been performing well in the international stage. Because like 20 years ago, I don’t know who is training the girls in their international competitions. Was it just sir Pitoy Moreno, or the handlers only? They were not as aggressive, not as tedious, or the training was not hard enough,” he said in a mix of English and Filipino.  But Filipinos are not the only ones getting trained. With the country’s winning streak, more and more ladies from other countries have come to be coached in beauty camps such as Aces and Queens and Kagandahang Flores. Miss International 2017 Kevin Lilliana of Indonesia trained under Flores. The 2018 Puteri Indonesia titleholders led by Sonia Citra, who competed alongside Catriona, were spotted watching a beauty pageant. They also underwent training under Flores last September. Francesca Mifsud, Miss Universe Malta 2018, underwent pageant training in the Philippines in September, where she took pasarela (pageant catwalk) training under the guidance of Mharvz Napoles. Ecuador’s representative, Virginia Limongi, reportedly trained under Aces and Queens. The same Aces and Queens produced the likes of Pia Wurtzbach, Megan Young, and Kylie Verzosa. Empowerment or objectification of women? Despite the wins and the training that Filipino candidates experienced, the debate on Filipinos’ love for pageants continues. Some believe that there are more important things than holding pageants in the country. (READ: The Philippines’ beauty pageant obsession: Who benefits?) Aurora de Dios, executive director of the Women and Gender Institute of Miriam College, and former chairperson of the National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women (now known as Philippine Commission for Women), said that she has nothing against women joining competitions but there are other ways to empower oneself. De Dios recalled that at one point after Gemma Cruz won, it was Gemma herself who led a protest against pageantry in the country. “She (Gemma Cruz) led the group of women – Gabriela at the time, to protest the pageant…well because you’re paraded around [in] your bathing suit and you are measured by your physical attributes,” De Dios said. “To me, that is kind of exploitative…because they are measured like a cow – for your beauty, for your hips, for your butt, etc. , with the idea that there’s a perfect norm about beauty. And then of course the measure of your beauty, whether you are tisay (mestiza or white) and definitely are not supposed to be colored. “So the idea of beauty that has been projected in this pageant is not only physically, you know, very physical in terms of its indicator of beauty, but also very racial even in the Philippines. So for that reason, I think, if you project beauty, it can be defined by any other indicator, but this one is very physical and they come. It’s also a contest where women compete for the title.” As to whether it empowers, De Dios said: “Is it empowering to me? It has always been exploitative. That’s what I think about it…and who are the judges? [They] are mostly dirty old men. Some are women, of course. The other is whether it is empowering or not. I think in the Philippines, with abject poverty, such that almost 60%, 70% of our people are poor, I’ve always believed that what makes us happy and what saves us [are] two things. People are just hopeful that their situation will get better.” Nathalie Verceles, director for the Center of Women’s and Gender Studies of the University of the Philippines, said that she has noticed that many of the candidates in the contests have been projected by the organizations behind the competitions as empowered women. While she has nothing against women competing, she said she would like to see more. “For us, empowerment is…having control over your life, in your choices, having control over your body. If we look at it from that perspective, you have to talk to the individual candidates in terms of how they see themselves with respect to these notions of empowerment. Do they really feel free when they’re winners? Because when you’re a reigning titleholder, I think the parameters are different as opposed to after you finish your reign.” She said she’s interested in knowing whether the women joined pageants not to win, but because there were opportunities provided after their reign. But others like the beauty queens themselves see that joining contests can be of help. Pauline Amelinckx, Mutya ng Pilipinas 2018 Global Beauty Queen, said: “Pageantry actually provides a very nice platform for girls of my age, even men of our age for their advocacy – to be part of something great, part of projects, and that like. And also, it’s not just only about us, but also about people that we bring together that support us. We fill stadiums and I think that’s something beautiful. That’s something I like about pageantry, especially here in the Philippines, because it’s such a big celebration here.” Peter Sereno, a former Filipino-Australian beauty pageant coach and commentator, who helped train Miss Universe 2004 Jennifer Hawkins, said that women are smart about getting into these types of contests. “I think there are certain women out there who recognize, and are in touch with, their femininity, knowing that in this industry, sex sells.

It doesn’t require a minimum order. The service is available in Metro Manila, and is currently being tested in Cebu City and Mandaue in Cebu. There are over 4,000 locally-based restaurants to choose from. Currently, the only available mode of payment is through cash. Grab’s mobile payment GrabPay will soon be integrated in its system. Philippines is the 6th country where Grab launched the service in the region, after Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. “We want their GrabFood experience to be more convenient and more rewarding.

Digital economy With the new service, Southeast Asia’s unicorn said that they are “accelerating their ability to leverage the opportunities of a shared digital economy.” \n\n Grab said that consumers are now able to connect thousands of restaurants only with their smartphones, as merchants get additional income from the in-app orders.

Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said on Monday, November 5, that the Euro-4 compliant tricycles aim to “fill in the gap for short-distance commute.”  “[GrabTrike] will fill in the short distance commute from the villages. The 3-wheeler would be able to service those areas in a much more efficient and budget-friendly manner,” Cu said. GrabTrike Premium is an upgrade from GrabTrike, which currently uses regular tricycles in Angeles, Pampanga, and in Balanga, Bataan. The firm will be fielding 2,000 Piaggio Ape units, a light commercial vehicle based on Vespa scooters. Since franchises for tricycles are under the supervision of local government units, Grab will be partnering with LGUs to roll out the service.  The Binalonan municipal government in Pangasinan is the first to adopt the premium tricycle service with 24 units. Cu said the fare scheme for GrabTrike Premium depends on the rates approved by the LGU, on top of a P10 booking fee which will go directly to the driver. For Binalonan, the local government approved a fare of P40 for the first two kilometers, and an additional P10 per succeeding kilometer. Modern transport More than being an “everyday app,” Grab aims for transportation modernization at its core, said Cu. The P185,000 Piaggio Ape can reach up to 38 kilometers on a liter of gas, which is Euro-4 compliant. Its transmission has reverse gear and has a maximum climb of 20.5% gradient – features a regular tricycle does not have. Because of the Piaggio Ape’s relatively low acquisition cost, Grab and AutoItalia offer easy ownership access with little to no equity to driver-operators. LGUs may also opt to partner with the ride-hailing firm to modernize their local tricycles. Grab said the package comes with a smartphone, preloaded with the app. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/announcements/215463-responsible-grab-commuting-tips/","title":"Always running into Grab-related commuting problems?","date":"Oct 29, 2018 3:01 PM PHT","snippet":"Here’s how you can ensure a smoother ride the next time you book","body":" MANILA, Philippines — Ever been on a Grab ride where your driver couldn’t find you? Do you double-check if you’ve placed the right pick-up pin as a response? This is the sharing economy at play. Like Grab drivers, Grab passengers play a part in what is called a shared economy. Shared economy, shared responsibilities A shared economy is defined as a peer-to-peer exchange of goods and services – usually owners rent out properties like their cars or houses that they don’t often use. #GrabResponsibly espouses the concept of shared economy. For Grab, the passangers, drivers and Grab itself each have their own responsibilities. To observe this, Grab drafted a manual of do’s and don’ts to guide both partner-drivers and passengers on the proper behavior and etiquette that will help ensure a smooth experience every Grab ride. We all have to deal with traffic and booking struggles, but doing your part can ensure a significantly smoother ride for you and other passengers. Here’s a few ways you can help lessen commuting woes, according to Grab’s manual of do’s and don’ts: When booking  ● Overloading is illegal. Go for the 6-seater option if there are more than 4 riders. ● No surprises — let the driver know if you’re bringing a furry friend. Bring your pets in a kennel or cage, and prepare for the worst-case scenario by having rags and poop bags ready. It’s still up to the driver, however, if they will allow you to ride with your pet or not. ● Refrain from cancelling – especially if it’s because of reasons like pinning the wrong pick-up dress. Did you know that if your cancelled bookings exceed the successful ones, your account may get suspended? While in transit  ● There’s a smoking ban, so don’t whip out cigarettes inside the car. ● All forms of sexual harassment towards drivers and passengers are punishable by law. Consensual acts such as flirting, PDA, and sexual intercourse are also strictly banned while inside the vehicle. ● Did you know that you can call 911 using the app? Click the sidebar, then choose the Emergency tab. You also have the option to add 3 emergency contacts, who can be set to receive auto-alerts from Grab. Upon dropping off  ● Remember to rate your driver. This will help Grab know how else they can improve the quality of your ride. Grab takes your feedback very seriously. ● Don’t ask the driver to go beyond the pinned drop-off point. For instance, avoid asking to be dropped off at the basement of the building instead of the lobby. ● Take your trash with you, and don’t forget to check all your stuff! After the trip ends, Grab and its drivers aren’t responsible for the items you leave behind. Remember, you don’t own the car you booked — you’re sharing it with other people. All you need to do is practice basic social etiquette!

The ride-hailing company launched its Safer Everyday Tech Roadmap on Monday, October 22, which features various programs, including a commitment to train drivers to be part of a pool of first responders. Drivers will be fully equipped with first aid kits and safety training guides. Grab also entered into a collaboration with the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG), Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) for crime and accident prevention. Grab, together with the PDEA and the LTFRB, will synchronize efforts to prevent the delivery of packages containing illegal drugs. The partnership also aims to identify and report timely intelligence information for anti-drug operations as well as keep the ride-hailing service drug-free. Grab will also conduct road safety, anti-carnapping, and other anti-criminal seminars and training with the PNP-HPG. “Safety in the TNVS (transport network vehicle service) industry should be a collaborative effort between transport network companies, government agencies, driver-partners, and passengers. Our passengers and driver-partners deserve a safer ride-sharing industry,” said Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu. Analytics for safety The roadmap also features enhancements on Grab’s driver platform, which tracks driver fatigue for them to “learn their driving patterns” and “identify how to drive more safely.” The driver fatigue monitoring system gives drivers reports on their patterns, such as in speeding, acceleration, and braking. The firm said there has been a 50% reduction in speeding incidents and a 20% reduction in hard braking and sudden acceleration since it rolled out the feature. “Our goal is to bring to zero the number of incidents that are completely preventable, and as far as possible, reduce the number of road accidents. Key to achieving our goal is to make it easy for users to make an actual change to their road behavior habits,” said Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling. Grab said its roadmap is aligned with the Department of Transportation’s vision to reduce the road accident death rate by at least 20% by 2020. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/214502-philippine-competition-commission-fines-grab-philippines-over-uber-deal/","title":"Antitrust watchdog fines Grab P16 million over Uber deal","date":"Oct 17, 2018 11:08 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Philippine Competition Commission slaps Grab with a fine of P12 million and Uber with P4 million for causing 'undue difficulties' to the review of their deal","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), the country’s antitrust watchdog, imposed P16-million ($296,741) worth of penalties on ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines for failing to maintain operations before it acquired Uber.

Following the review, the PCC slapped Grab with a fine of P12 million ($222,586) and Uber with P4 million ($74,195) for causing “undue difficulties” to the review. (READ: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?) “While we’re reviewing [the deal], you revert first to your pre-merger situation.

In this situation, when Grab purchased Uber, Uber already exited. We would have a more difficult time imposing the possible solution. That’s why we said come back first,” Quimbo added. On April, the PCC released interim measures while they were reviewing the Grab-Uber deal. Quimbo said that the ride-hailing companies violated two measures, for a total of 10 counts. Under the law, PCC can impose penalties of, at most, P2 million ($37,097) per violation, which led to the P16-million total. The PCC left it to both firms on how they will settle the penalty. The order, which was sent to Grab on October 11, can still be appealed. The ride-hailing firm must submit a motion for reconsideration 15 days since receipt.

Sprint legend grabs double after painful kick","date":"Oct 12, 2018 7:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Usain Bolt recovers from a kick in the groin by scoring 2 goals in a preseason football game for Australia's Central Coast Mariners","body":"     SYDNEY, Australia – Sprint legend Usain Bolt scored his first goals in professional football Friday, October 12, after starting up front in a preseason game for Australia’s Central Coast Mariners. The 100 meters world record-holder, who is bidding for a professional contract, recovered from a painful kick in the groin to grab a double against Macarthur South West United in Sydney. Bolt, 32, finished with his left foot after some slack marking on 55 minutes, celebrating with his trademark “Lightning Bolt” pose. The Jamaican then capitalized on a defensive mix-up to score his second on 69 minutes before being substituted 6 minutes later with the score at 4-0. It was the first game Bolt has started since joining the A-League club in August for an indefinite trial. “I’m just happy that I got a chance and I’m proud of myself,” Bolt told host broadcaster Fox Sports after the game. “It was a big deal… first start and scoring two goals. It was a good feeling. This is what I worked towards. I try to get better and I am on the way to doing that.” Bolt said he had a “lot more to learn” and was keen to join the Mariners on a professional contract. “I’m keen, that’s why I’m here to play my best and to try and get into the team,” he added. The superstar, a massive Manchester United fan, was handed a chance to train with the A-League side for an indefinite period in order to pursue his boyhood dream of becoming a professional footballer. Whether he signs for the Mariners appears still up in the air, but the brace bolstered his case after a difficult first-half where he missed chances and appeared to struggle with the pace and movement of the game. “They’ve seen me in training, they’ve seen what I’m capable of and so, they need to analyze and say, ‘Is he good enough for this club?’ and they will tell me that,” Bolt told reporters after the game. “I just did what I had to do and that’s as far as I can go.” Recently installed coach Mike Mulvey said he was focused on the first game of the season for the Mariners, who finished bottom of the table last season, but heaped praised on the eight-time Olympic champion for his goals. “You’ve got to be so happy for the guy, haven’t you?” Mulvey told reporters. Bolt appeared to appeal for game time, saying he would improve as he gained more understanding of his teammates and what they wanted. He has previously tried out with clubs in Germany, South Africa and Norway to no avail. The Mariners have been giving him one-on-one sessions on top of the squad’s training in a bid to turn him into A-League material for when the season starts a week from now. The Mariners will face Brisbane Roar, the club Mulvey was sacked from in 2014, in their first game next Sunday. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/213982-number-of-elective-positions/","title":"2019 midterm elections: Over 18,000 posts up for grabs","date":"Oct 10, 2018 6:54 PM PHT","snippet":"The filing of certificates of candidacy for these positions is from October 11 to 12 and October 15 to 17, 2018","body":" MANILA, Philippines – More than 18,000 national and local positions will be up for grabs in the midterm elections on May 13, 2019.  Aspirants to these positions are expected to troop to offices of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to file their certificates of candidacy (COC) from October 11 to 12 and from October 15 to 17, 2018.

Smith & Williamson will serve as the independent body that will monitor Grab’s compliance to the pricing and service quality commitments it had pledged to PCC when it acquired Uber. (READ: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?) “Smith & Williamson as the independent monitoring group will serve as our eyes and ears on the ground. Their reports or recommendations will be evaluated but PCC will still ultimately determine any possible transgressions,” Antitrust Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said. Smith & Williamson is a top UK firm that has over a century’s experience as an audit firm, and 13 years of reporting to various antitrust bodies across the world. It handled high-profile cases such as the Lufthansa-Singapore Airlines joint-venture case and Times Publishing Limited’s acquisition of British publisher Penguin. The Competition & Consumer Commission of Singapore had tapped it to monitor how Grab and Uber should operate while the CCCS investigated the deal, according to the Wall Street Journal.  In August, the PCC approved the Grab-Uber deal but bound Grab to commitments, as if Uber were still operating in the Philippines:  In a statement on Wednesday, Grab Philippines said it found Smith & Williamson “truly fair and independent” based on the latter’s their previous engagement in Singapore. It was Grab that submitted Smith & Williamson as a nominee to the PCC, along with another firm. “Grab is satisfied with the decision of the PCC, appointing Smith & Williamson as the independent third party monitor trustee,” Leo Gonzales, Grab’s public affairs head said. “We are looking forward to collaborating with them as we intend to fully conform with and fulfill the voluntary commitments we have submitted to the PCC for the entire duration of the agreed compliance period,” he added. The PCC launched its own review of the acquisition deal between the two companies. The review was suspended when Grab submitted voluntary commitments in June that would address the antitrust watchdog’s concerns. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/213085-power-trumps-rights-trillanes-amnesty/","title":"[OPINION | NEWSPOINT] Power trumps rights","date":"Sep 29, 2018 11:20 AM PHT","snippet":"What are the rest of us only too quick to profess righteous resistance actually lending to this moral fight?","body":" A “political analyst” – that’s the title bestowed on just about anyone willing to talk politics on the air – has been heard to comment on television that Senator Antonio Trillanes IV has only himself to blame for the trouble he’s in: he has “abused his political rights.” That’s a most dangerous notion to propagate at this time, when power is used so heavy-handedly rights have been reduced to an even weaker counterforce to it than they already are by nature. It is power, not rights, that is open to abuse. The definitive nuance is illustrated even in linguistic usage: power is wielded, that is, used as a weapon, thus lending itself easily to misuse and, yes, abuse. That’s why power is coveted, fought over, grabbed. Rights, on the other hand, are simply exercised, put into effect in the casual course of civic life, and that’s why they tend to be taken for granted. In fact, rights can become so weakened – thanks to whom else but the insidious wielders of power – they need to be asserted, reasserted, and, as called for these desperate days, fought for. I don’t myself think it so objectionable for rights, mismatched as they are against power, to be exercised purposefully or not exercised by deliberate default in support of a fellow rights holder, a fellow underdog. But to do that in the service of power amounts to collaborationism. And that might just be the case with our “political analyst,” whom I don’t name here, not only because I did not hear the commentary firsthand – I was merely told about it – but also because personalizing the issue might only detract from the impersonal point I’m trying to make. Anyway, our “political analyst” wished seemingly to give the impression that a certain timidity in the exercise of one’s rights in fact marks the normal or sober or otherwise proper exercise of those rights, and that the way Trillanes has done it is the wrong way – the abusive way. That viewpoint seems to me to reflect a reckless leave-taking of one’s sense of proportion and other basic rationalities. Trillanes belongs to a Senate minority too thin to be an effective voting watchdog. Surely, making up for that lack with a bold voice and a dogged sense of inquiry into corruption and other official wrongdoing does not constitute abuse of anything, let alone rights, no matter what discomfort Trillanes’ findings may have caused President Duterte. If anyone is guilty of abuse here it’s Duterte. In fact, abuse is too mild a word to describe the way he perverts power. To Trillanes, he does it with obvious concoctions. He wants voided the amnesty granted him 7 years ago for a coup he led against President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. He quibbles that, by getting his amnesty without applying for it, Trillanes failed to meet a procedural requirement.  Just a curious thought: You’d think the coup should have been canceled out by the crime Arroyo herself had confessed to, and been forgiven for, by national default, which allowed her to assume the presidency on a rigged vote. But, now Speaker of the House and a principal Duterte partner, Arroyo shares in the same power being brought down on Trillanes in conspiratorial fashion – us against them. Apart from Trillanes, “them” has so far included Senator Leila de Lima and former Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno – once Trillanes is done for, is there any doubt Vice President Leni Robredo, the constitutional successor to the presidency, will be the next target?  De Lima came in Duterte’s crosshairs for hounding him for death-squad kills  when he was mayor of Davao City; she has been in jail for two years now, denied bail, while on trial in a case cooked up from the testimonies of convicts serving life terms for the same crime – dealing in illegal drugs. As for Sereno, she got it for fending Duterte off her turf; she was ousted by her own Supreme Court, whose majority he has coopted, on the same pretext as in Trillanes’ case – an unmet (actually waived) requirement for her nomination for chief justice. The two continue to take on the Duterte regime with what’s left of their severely suppressed rights – De Lima through “communications” smuggled from prison, Sereno through pronouncements at civic forums. Trillanes himself has no illusions. He knows Duterte wants him, like De Lima, locked up even before he is tried and found guilty. Up against a mad man indulged in his authoritarian presidency by a coterie of cronies, a subservient police force and a passive military, and a mass following of fools, he may have, if anything, grown fatalistic, but he is one tested enough to not go down without a fight.  But what are the rest of us only too quick to profess righteous resistance actually lending to this moral fight? – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/212955-grab-philippines-expand-mobile-services-bills-payments-purchases/","title":"Grab PH expands mobile wallet services to bills payment, purchases","date":"Sep 27, 2018 2:57 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab is among 11 non-banks licensed to operate as electronic money issuers in the country","body":" MANILA, Philippines – While majority of Filipinos still transact using cash, Southeast Asia ride-hailing giant Grab expanded its mobile wallet services in the Philippines to promote cashless transactions. In a statement on Thursday, September 27, Grab said it is expanding its mobile wallet services “GrabPay” to include bills payment, food orders, and in-store and in-restaurant purchases. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas granted the firm a license to operate as an electronic money issuer in August. Grab is among the 11 non-banks with EMI license so far. “With the support from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we can now help millions participate in the cashless, digital economy without the need for a bank account or to download additional apps,” said Ooi Huey Tyng, managing director of GrabPay Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Users can load their GrabPay through online banking, bank deposits, credit card payment, or paying at convenience store 7-11, Cebuana, or directly to an eligible Grab driver. Currently, GrabPay can be used to book rides, send package deliveries, or to top-up one’s mobile prepaid load. The firm said it is still working on the integration of mobile payments for food deliveries. Grab said  the Philippines is the 5th country in Southeast Asia “where the ‘full suite’ of GrabPay mobile wallet services becomes available.” Under its rewards program, users who opt to pay via GrabPay receive twice as much rewards that can be used to redeem ride, stores, and services discounts.

Singapore-headquartered Grab agreed to buy US firm Uber’s ride-hailing and food business in Southeast Asia in March, ending a bruising battle between the companies. In return, Uber received a 27.5% stake in Grab. However the deal came under scrutiny across the region, and the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore was among watchdogs in several countries that launched probes. In the conclusion to its investigation, the commission said it had found the merger had substantially reduced “competition in the ride-hailing platform market in Singapore.” Grab fares rose between 10% and 15% after the deal as the company reduced the number of points earned by riders and made it harder for them to redeem them, it said. Potential competitors were hampered by exclusivity agreements Grab forged with taxi companies, car rental partners, and some of its drivers, the commission said. The deals meant drivers could not work for other companies. The commission fined both firms a total Sg$13 million ($9.5 million) – Sg$6.42 million for Grab and Sg$6.58 million for Uber – “to deter completed, irreversible mergers that harm competition.” The body also criticized Grab and Uber for not getting the commission’s clearance before completing the deal. In addition to the fines, the commission ordered several measures be implemented to ease fares and allow new players to compete with Grab, including reverting to pre-merger pricing and allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing platforms. Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore, said the firm completed the deal “within its legal rights, and still maintains we did not intentionally or negligently breach competition laws.” In the Philippines, the competition watchdog last month approved the merger but imposed conditions related to areas including pricing and exclusivity arrangements to prevent Grab acting like a monopoly. Malaysian authorities are also examining the deal. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/212542-thewrap-september-21-2018-evening-edition/","title":"Itogon landslide, Nene Pimentel on Mocha Uson, Grab fares | Evening wRap","date":"Sep 21, 2018 9:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening wRap with Chito dela Vega","body":"Today on Rappler: Rescuers ordered to leave as fresh landslides threaten Itogon. ‘Distortion of truth’: Diokno family slams Bongbong Marcos, Enrile.

On Monday, August 20, the TNVS Driver and Operator led by Winson Esteras filed the case at a regional trial court in San Mateo, Rizal, against Nograles for what they deemed were the lawmaker’s accusations that led to “reduced income for the drivers.” They also demanded that the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) reinstate the P2-per-minute charge. “Sinubukan naming habaan ang aming oras sa kalsada para mapunan ang kakapusan sa aming kita simula nang nireklamo ni Congressman Jericho ‘Koko’ Nograles ang time component sa pamasahe na malaking tulong sa aming mga drivers,” they said.

(READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) The LTFRB also imposed a P10-million fine on Grab, and ordered the company to reimburse its riders by way of rebates. In a statement, Nograles said that the case filed against him was an “act of desperation” to reinstate the P2-per-minute charge. “The P5-million damage suit against me is nothing more than an act of desperation in retaliation to the recent LTFRB Order declaring the charges of Grab Philippines as illegal. It comes as no surprise as there is no end to the greed of a company that demands slave-like hours and immoral commission rates from its drivers,” Nograles said. “I call on the LTFRB to demand that Grab refund the billions of pesos in illegal charges, as ordered and without any further delay,” he added. Grab denied a hand in the filing of case, saying it was the “TNVS drivers who were greatly affected.” Under the government-approved fare scheme issued in December 2016, Grab Philippines can only charge a flagdown rate of P40 and an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. Last January, Grab applied for a 5% fare hike. The LTFRB recently approved 5 new ride-hailing companies, but Grab still dominates the market after its acquisition of Uber.

In a media briefing after the PCC approved the Grab-Uber buyout, lawyer Miguel Aguila said the fares of the ride-hailing company would still be within a set range. “What we are committed to is not to increase our fares by 22% more than what it was last year. So the fare structure can change the minimum and maximum fares… but we will [just] have to stay at a certain range,” Aguila said on Friday, August 10. This means that fares, for example, that range around P170 last year cannot be more than P200 following the PCC conditions, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said. In January, the ride-hailing giant applied for a 5% fare hike at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Aguila said that Grab’s pricing scheme will rely on what the LTFRB will allow. On Friday, the PCC approved the regional acquisition deal between ride-hailing giants Grab and Uber, but imposed conditions that Grab has to follow until there is “sufficient competition” in the market. To meet antitrust commitments, Cu said that they have lowered their surge rates to 1.8 times the regular fare. “The average price will still stay within range. Our way to increase revenue of our partners is not to increase in prices [but] it’s providing more rides by adding more vehicles on the roads,” Cu said. Challenges: Cu noted that improving the allocation rate of drivers to passengers will continue to  be a challenge, given the LTFRB’s franchise cap at 65,000 units. “To achieve levels in which service quality goes back up to 70% allocation rate – that the LTFRB said is their basis of ‘maximum supply’ – would still be tough if we cannot add more cars,” Cu said. Grab earlier said that there are only around 35,000 drivers that serve 600,000 bookings per day. This, they said, affects the booking acceptance for passengers as “demand exceeds supply.” To address this, Cu called on the LTFRB to reimpose their P2-per-minute travel duration charge that was suspended by the regulatory board, or to allow them to accept new drivers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/209258-philippine-competition-commission-pricing-service-grab-uber-deal/","title":"Antitrust body OKs Grab-Uber deal, sets conditions","date":"Aug 10, 2018 1:04 PM PHT","snippet":"Any breach of the fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments set by the Philippine Competition Commission will subject Grab to fines of up to P2 million per violation","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has bound ride-hailing company Grab Philippines to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments for acquiring Uber. The PCC released its decision on Friday, August 10 – 70 days after Grab first submitted commitments to address concerns of “virtual monopoly” of the ride-hailing service. Any breach of the conditions will subject Grab to fines of up to P2 million per violation. Unwinding the acquisition deal is still a possibility, depending on the gravity of the violation. The commitments are enforceable starting Friday, the PCC said. “In effect, while Grab operates as a virtual monopolist, the commitments assure the public that quality and price levels that would prevail are those that had been [there] when they still faced competition in Uber,” PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said.  Monitoring: Compliance to the commitments will be monitored by a third-party body that will independently monitor Grab for a period of one year.  “Grab can apply to release themselves from the commitments if there are already sufficient competition in the market.

Around half of the funds came from Japanese car giant Toyota, which announced last month it was pumping $1 billion into Grab, Southeast Asia’s dominant ride-share company. Grab said a “significant portion” of the proceeds would go to developing operations in Indonesia, where it has partnered with local firm Ovo to offer what it said was the country’s most widely accepted mobile payments system. The announcement comes after Grab’s regional rival, Indonesian ride-hailing app Go-Jek, said in May it was investing $500 million to expand into Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. Singapore-based Grab, which operates in eight countries, launched an on-demand grocery delivery service in Jakarta last month. Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing market is expected to be worth $20 billion by 2025, according to research by Google and Singapore investment vehicle Temasek. However, Grab’s agreement to buy US giant Uber’s Southeast Asian business this year has run into trouble, with Singapore’s anti-monopoly watchdog calling for changes to the deal and threatening to overturn it. Grab last week disputed the watchdog’s finding that the buyout infringed competition rules, but vowed it would continue to cooperate with the ongoing review. In return for selling its Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food operations, Uber received a 27.5% stake in Grab. Since the merger, several new players, including India’s Jugnoo and Singapore-based Ryde, have entered the city-state’s ride-hailing market. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/208630-world-slots-up-ironman-philippines/","title":"World slots up in Ironman 70.3 Philippines","date":"Aug 1, 2018 5:06 PM PHT","snippet":"Age-group berths for the 2019 Ironman 70.3 World Championship in France are up for grabs in the Cebu race","body":"   MANILA, Philippines – Age groupers gear up for a spirited battle not only for top honors in their respective divisions but also for world championship berths when the Ironman 70.3 Philippines Asia-Pacific fires off Sunday, August 5, at the Shangri-La Mactan Resort and Spa in Lapu-Lapu City in Cebu.

Celine Domingo dished out a personal best 22-hit game, including 15 attack points and 4 kill blocks, while playmaker Kyle Negrito produced 21 excellent sets as the Lady Tams recovered from a second-set meltdown to foil the debuting Red Spikers.

Grab allegedly created fake accounts on Micab to hit them with a “firestorm of phantom bookings” that sabotaged their operations and attempted to poach their drivers. “Drivers waste time and money going to a pick-up location for passengers that will never come, and they ultimately become wary about accepting trips.” In a BusinessWorld report, Ybañez said the number of “phantom bookings” has reportedly reached 29,000 since June. Ybañez cited a similar incident in Singapore where ride-hailing platform Ryde announced that they had allegedly been hit with over 2,000 “phantom bookings” from over 300 fake accounts. The IP addresses of the fake accounts reportedly traced back to Grab. Apart from the similarities to the Ryde incident, Ybanez said he knows his local rival is behind the attacks because drivers on his platform are being called to join Grab. “After booking one of our cabs, then waiting as usual before canceling, our drivers will receive a call a few minutes later inviting them to a driver’s orientation for Grab” “If this occurred one or two times, you could easily dismiss it to coincidence — perhaps Grab obtained the driver’s number through some under means — but it’s happened several thousand times,” he added.

In a 27-page motion for reconsideration, MyTaxi.PH, the registered company of Grab, said that LTFRB should “reverse and set aside” the July 9 order imposing fines and remibursement of the charge to its patrons for its “utter lack of merit.” “Respondent MyTaxi.PH respectfully prays that this Honorable Board reverse and set aside its order dated July 9, and in lieu of, issue a new one dismissing the show-cause order and case for utter lack of merit,” the motion filed on July 19 said. \n\n Grab argued that LTFRB’s decision imposing fines on Grab “is contrary to law” because a department order allowing ride-hailing firms to set their own fares “was still valid” when they changed their fare structure. The Department of Transportation Order (DO) 2015-11 gave transportation network companies (TNCs) the right to “set fares, subject to LTFRB’s oversight.” Another order, DO 2017-11, was issued on June 19, 2017 – days after Grab imposed the charge – which allowed TNCs to have a “pre-arranged fare as authorized by the LTFRB”. “DO 2015-11 remains to be valid and effective until struck down as unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,” Grab argued. “Moreover, the Horable Board failed to establish that said DO has been impliedly repealed by any subsequent issuances of DOTr…As a rule, repeal by implication is frowned upon, unless there is clear showing that the latter statute is irreconcilaby consistent,” they added. Grab said that despite the order allowing them to set fares on their own, they still “complied” with the oversight functions of the Board. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?)

A December 2016 order regulated ride-hailing services fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer travel.

Partners have 3 options on how they wish to integrate their services into the platform. The first is to build into GrabPlatform – directly integrating the services into the Grab app. Second, they can “empower” their apps with GrabPlatform, enabling partners to link Grab’s services with theirs. This is similar to how Lazada and Shopee allow products bought from their site to be delivered via GrabExpress. Lastly, they can engage prospective customers through GrabPlatform by advertising their products and services in the app’s news feed, as well as adding promotions for GrabRewards. With regards to selecting their partners, Grab said that they are first and foremost looking for those who provide everyday services that the platform’s users need. They are also working to ensure no two partners will offer the same service under the platform. Finally, they said that partners should provide income opportunities for the 100 million micro-entrepreneurs already part of Grab’s network. In the same event, Grab launched GrabFresh, an in-app service that lets users shop for and have their groceries delivered right to their homes. The service is a product of GrabPlatform involving the partnership between Grab and popular online grocery platform, HappyFresh.

Singapore-based Grab in March agreed to buy Uber’s food and ride-hailing business in Southeast Asia, ending a bruising battle between the ride-hailing companies. But Singapore’s competition commission found that the deal created a virtual monopoly in the city-state’s ride-hailing market, with Grab raising prices after the merger was completed, it said in a statement. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) criticised both companies for going ahead with the “irreversible” deal despite restrictions imposed in March to pause the transaction while an anti-competition probe was underway. “CCCS’s investigations also revealed that the parties had even provided for a mechanism to apportion eventual antitrust financial penalties,” the statement said. The Singapore commission asked Grab to revert to pre-merger pricing and end its exclusive contracts with drivers so other players will find it easier to enter the market. It also suggested a series of potential “remedies” to ensure fair competition and called for a public consultation on the proposed measures. “CCCS may require the Parties to unwind the transaction unless the… public consultation confirms that any of the proposed remedies… are sufficient to address the identified competition concerns”, it warned. The deal has come under scrutiny across the region, with Malaysia and the Philippines also launching investigations. In return for selling its Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food operations, California-headquartered Uber received a 27.5 percent stake in Grab. Grab said in a statement that it disagrees with the commission’s findings, calling it a “narrow approach in defining competition”. “This provisional decision and proposed remedies are overreaching and go against Singapore’s pro-innovation and pro-business regulations in a free market economy,” it said, adding that it will appeal the decision.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/206583-grab-philippines-plans-multimodal-passenger-transport-system/","title":"Grab planning seamless ‘mix-and-match’ transport system in PH","date":"Jul 5, 2018 6:44 PM PHT","snippet":"The multimodal passenger transport system envisioned by Grab allows passengers to select and take different modes of transport using the Grab service to reach their destination","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab officially unveiled a number of newly added features to its platform, as well as plans to eventually have a multimodal passenger transport system in the country. The announcements were made during a media event on Thursday, July 5. “The idea for us here in the Philippines is to take away cars travelling through the major roads – the highly congested roads – and move them into higher-capacity vehicles like shuttles or buses,” said Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines. The multimodal passenger transport system envisioned by Grab allows their passengers to seamlessly select and take different modes of transport to reach their destination. For instance, a Grab user can first take an on-demand shuttle, then hop on to a public bus, then finally take a GrabCar to the destination all in the same app. Ideally, this should decrease costs for passengers, help increase the income of Grab’s driver partners, and decrease congestion in roads but, Cu admits that there are huge challenges to achieving this vision. Unlike in Singapore where Grab is allowed to run shuttles, Cu said that until they have regulations in place that allow them to implement this system, it’s difficult to move forward with their plans. Despite the lack of a timeline for a potential rollout of this system, Cu said they were reaching out to regulators and operators to build their multimodal transport system. “We’re in talks right now with a few P2P bus operators to see how we can use them as the mid-mile while we provide the first and last mile form of transport, either via car or trike,” Cu added. Expanding GrabPay Meanwhile, Grab discussed plans of expanding the use of GrabPay beyond the services they offer. Grab’s country marketing head, Cindy Toh, said users can pay bills, buy load, and conduct other common transactions with GrabPay and earn rewards by doing so. She believes that by incentivizing the feature, it can convince people to adopt it, even in a cash-dominated market such as the Philippines. For Grab drivers, they can build credit histories with Grab so that they can qualify for financial services such as loans and insurance solutions. Apart from this, the ride-hailing service officially unveiled GrabFood, their food-delivery service on soft launch and Grab Daily, an in-app feed that lets users read lifestyle news, play games, or check restaurant recommendations. Both of these features are now available in the Grab app. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/206028-development-model-displacement-situation-southeast-asia/","title":"Developed and displaced in Southeast Asia","date":"Jun 30, 2018 8:30 AM PHT","snippet":"The examples of displacement and their continuing impacts are a reminder that Southeast Asia's model of development, anchored on physical infrastructure projects and the exploitation of natural resources, has not changed very much","body":" BANGKOK, Thailand – Families moved to distant, poorly equipped resettlement areas to make way for railways in the Philippines. Villagers still dealing with the loss of access to livelihood resources decades after dam construction in Thailand. Communities in Indonesia seeing their lands converted to palm oil plantations run by privately held concessions. If these sound like scenes from two to 4 decades ago – well, they are. They are still happening today in Southeast Asia, long after the television cameras have packed up and newspaper headlines about many of them have faded away. Not too long ago, in the ’90s and onward, there was burning debate about models of development and ways to tame globalization, attempts to redefine development beyond GDP figures to include equity, reduction of income gaps, the concept of human development and a better balancing of benefits. The term “sustainable development” became a buzzword at that time. It has actually found its way back into today’s development language. But the examples of displacement and their continuing impacts are a reminder that Southeast Asia’s model of development, anchored on physical infrastructure projects and the exploitation of natural resources, has not changed very much. “Yes, we are still in the same development model,” said Nur Hidayati, executive director of the Indonesian environmental group WALHI. “I think (in) a lot of the global forums, there is also a lot of debate on whether economic growth is still valid as the indicator of [the] progress of society. We need to find something that are beyond these things.” While alternatives such as Bhutan’s Gross Happiness Index or the United Nations’ Human Development Index have been discussed and used, “they are not yet mainstreamed,” she told a June discussion called “Chased by Development” here, organized by SEA Junction. “Economic growth is still the main indicator of the health of the economy and if you talk about economic growth, it means, simply, exports minus imports.” This, she continued, is why countries like Indonesia, dependent on generating growth from extractive industries and natural resources, find it hard to shift to, say, a focus on the services sector. “Development means different things,” said Kanokwan Manorom, a professor at Thailand’s Ubon Ratchathani University who has studied the impact of dam projects in Thailand and the Mekong countries. “From the government perspective, it means progress, growth, prosperity. For them, it means to reduce poverty. But for the local people, they do not need dams. They would just like to have something  they can count on [for a living], just as resources, aquatic resources. Development [for them] means something that can sustain their livelihoods.” Danger zones to death zones  In the Philippines, the practice of involuntary resettlement of residents to make way for the construction of transport infrastructure has repeatedly failed, but continues to be done today, said Melissa Quetulio-Navarra, head of the relocation and resettlement monitoring and development division at the government’s Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor (PCUP). “It’s really frustrating because up to now, since the ’70s, resettlement programs have used the traditional approach,” explained Navarra. “Social justice in resettlement is still elusive.” This traditional approach consists of the government moving residents, usually from the capital Metro Manila, a megacity of more than 13 million, to areas 30 to 50 kilometers away, where there are often little basic services such as electricity, sanitation or education. While the government provides mass housing, displacement assistance and low-interest loans payable over 30 years, would-be residents have little inputs in these. Resettlement studies by the Philippine government itself show that the attrition rate – the selling or abandonment of occupancy rights – stands at a high 40%. Navarra added that there are 15,000 unoccupied housing units in the 18 resettlement sites that are being monitored by the government. “There is not one case that you can find where it (off-city relocation) has worked,” Navarra pointed out. “Some people, they have been relocated from danger zones to death zones.” The question is whether the Philippine government can learn from past experience to find ways to make resettlement more community-friendly through concepts such as the “people’s plan approach,” that Navarra said, the PCUP is pushing for. This entails a lot of community organizing so that the high-density housing projects that resettlement typically includes are more habitable and are set up with “due diligence with a social lens,” she said. (READ: Informal settlers: Integration, not just relocation) At present, Navarra said, some 522,000 urban poor residents who live in informal settlements are to be displaced by right-of-way clearing as part of ambitious infrastructure plans around railways, bridges, and roads under the “Build, Build, Build” program of President Rodrigo Duterte from 2017 to 2022. The rehabilitation of railways under the Southrails Project, aimed at easing massive transportation woes, is expected to lead to the resettlement of 100,000 informal settlers who live less than 15 kilometers from railway tracks. “We are now facing this big nagging question: is transformable resettlement possible for these informal settlement families?” asked Navarra, who is also national project manager for the Southrails Project of the Philippines’ transportation department. Resettlement – and much more – were also at the core of two of the most high-profile examples of the disruptive effects of development in the ’90s: the Pak Mun Dam in Thailand and the Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric dam in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. The Pak Mun dam in northeastern Thailand was completed in 1994, while the Nam Theun 2 in Khammoun province, central Laos, started operating in 2010. Today, these cases, both involving World Bank funds, may sound like examples from bygone days. As of December 2017, in fact, the Bank said it had concluded its environmental and social project aimed at managing the impacts of the $1.2 billion Nam Theun 2 project. But the stories behind dam projects in the region are far from complete, or over. Pak Mun problems  More than two decades since the Pak Mun dam was built, Kanokwan said the communities – whose access to fish and other resources was undermined by the construction of the run-of-the-river dam off the Mun River – continue to protest the project’s impacts. Twenty five years, she pointed out, means 15 Thai prime ministers and 17 governments later. “After 24 years, the problems are still there,” she explained. Since the early days, the villagers have been trying to have the dam’s gates open to allow fish, which they depend on for a living, to pass through. “The government is trying to open the gates 4 months [in a year] to allow fish from the Mekong River to [get to] the Mun River,” she said. “They (communities) are not against the dams in the sense of development growth, but they are against the dam because the dam damaged their livelihoods,” Kanokwan said. At one point, local villagers occupied the Pak Mun dam site in protest. Recalling Nam Theun 2  Today, there is a lot less publicity about the Nam Theun 2 dam. The World Bank called it an example of sustainable hydropower built after “over a decade of consultation and planning,” but civil society called it an environmental and social debacle. Among the problems after the Nam Thuen 2’s construction, Kanokwan explained, are the flooding of the farmlands of downstream communities and the forced relocation of ethnic groups to higher ground and far away from the Theun River. Looking back, the old, difficult question remains: How can “sustainable resettlement” be undertaken in development projects?  Over in Indonesia, land conversion for export crops like palm oil and the parceling of land into concessions to private companies – many of them from neighboring Malaysia and Singapore – has worrisome impacts not only on the environment, but on the social fabric, WALHI’s Hidayati explained. Already, she said, WALHI monitored 302 land conflicts in 2017, and handled 187 of them across 28 provinces.  “There has not even been resettlement,” she pointed out. In many cases, she said, land is being grabbed from communities without compensation. Palm oil, Indonesia’s biggest export in non-gas commodities, plays a key factor in many of these conflicts given that much of the conversion has been to make way for cultivating this profitable product. From 2008 to 2018, the area planted to palm oil in Indonesia doubled to 15.7 million hectares, said Hidayati, citing figures from the country’s anti-graft commission. Some 80 million hectares of land have been licensed to, and are controlled by, private companies that use them for plantations and mining, among others. The 25 largest oil palm plantation companies control 5.1 million hectares of land, Hidayati added. “There is a lack of recognition of community rights over land and resources,” she said, especially in Indonesia’s export-oriented growth. New players  While the development model in Southeast Asia has remained largely the same over the decades, other major players have come into the scene when it comes to development projects. In the past, most of the focus was on the role of financial institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in major infrastructure projects. But over the decades, Southeast Asia has seen a much larger role by private companies, including those going into cross-border investments as integration deepens in the ASEAN Community.  In more recent years, too, China’s economic footprint, through its investments and aid, has become bigger as it projects its soft power. Unlike international financial institutions, China’s funds come with less conditionalities and assessments of social and environmental impacts. Researcher Allan Beesey, who has looked into the impact of development projects in the region, believes that despite problems, international development finance institutions remain the safer bet because they have at least developed more monitoring systems over the decades. “Our best bet is to stick to the ADB and World Bank that have put a lot of work on safeguards,” he said. “But they are still trying to get it right.” – Rappler.com Johanna Son is the Bangkok-based editor of the Reporting ASEAN program.

During the 3rd hearing on the issue on Tuesday, LTFRB said that the charge will remain suspended pending the resolution of questions on its legal basis. “The decision on the suspension and the resolution will be resolved as one,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III told Grab Philippines. PBA Representative Jericho Nograles had earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge, which the LTFRB was not informed about, was suspended in April. The ride-hailing company appealed the suspension, saying that the order is “contrary to the law” and would “cause irreparable damage” to riders and drivers. Under the government-approved fare scheme, Grab can only charge a flagdown rate of P40 and an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer, a December 2016 order said.  Grab Philippines said it would comply with LTFRB’s order but hopes that the suspension would be lifted soon. “We hope to get some resolution very soon, matagal nang naghihintay ang mga drivers para dito (the drivers have been waiting for this for some time). At least, they can perform better and serve the public better,” Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales told reporters in a media interview. “The impact is not really with Grab but with the drivers. We have to also take other factors – oil price hike, inflation – which contributes to the drivers earning less. The P2 per minute charge is the equalizing factor,” Gonzales added. Grab also said that some drivers stopped driving for the ride-hailing company, citing lesser income to sustain their families. Gonzales said that only around 30,000 drivers are available for over 600,000 bookings daily, and called on the LTFRB to accept new transportation vehicle network services (TNVS) drivers. (READ: Brian Cu: Grab driver cancellations down by 50%) The next hearing on the alleged illegal charge is set on July 25.

As you may have noticed, the complaints in social media already declined,” he added. According to Cu, lesser income drove the unwanted behavior. Grab assured drivers that they will continue to receive subsidies “as long as they need money.” On June 19, the company announced that it has started to provide subsidy for trips that fall below P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour, in response to the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to suspend the P2 per-minute travel charge.  Grab said the subsidy scheme would cost around P100 million a month.

In response, senior international news professionals write this open letter.","body":" (Editor’s note: At the World Association of News Publishers’ annual Congress in early June in Portugal, the news industry’s treatment of women was exposed during a series of events. This prompted an open letter signed by journalists and editors from across continents, highlighting the problem of sexism and harassment in newsrooms. The statement, which follows below, calls for the establishment of 14 principles of gender news equality for the news industry. The image used above is by Helen Pryłowska of Newsmavens.) The World Association of News Publishers’ (WAN-IFRA) annual Congress in early June is one of the media world’s major industry events – a networking opportunity for close to a thousand attendees from international news publishing, with keynote speakers and panel discussions addressing the future of journalism and the news business in a time of convergent crises. It should be the pinnacle of good practice, shaping the path for industry progression. But the 2018 World News Congress was a study in contrasts, one indicative of the news industry’s treatment of women: symbolic (and at times substantial) gestures of respect interspersed with real, sometimes shocking sexual discrimination and harassment. Women in news: moving from the sidebar to the front page The event began with the second annual Women in News Summit  featuring the BBC, The New York Times, former Editor in Chief of USA Today and author of That’s What She Said Joanne Lipman, former CEO of Gizmodo Media Group Raju Narisetti, and many others committed to championing diversity within their news organizations. Their impressive stories and good practices alone made the trip to Portugal worthwhile. However, the Summit was relegated to pre-conference programming – like an asterisk to the main event. And while the Congress curation achieved unprecedented levels of gender balance (46% of speakers were women), the opening ceremony saw a veritable wall of men (we lost count at number nine) speak for 90 minutes before the prestigious Golden Pen of Freedom was eventually awarded to Maria Ressa. The award bestowed on Ressa, CEO and Editor-in-Chief of Rappler.com, recognized her sustained fightback against the gendered, state-sponsored harassment of journalists in the Philippines. It was an important and deeply symbolic decision to select Ressa. But by the time she was allowed to speak, several delegates had left the venue in disgust with the total absence of diversity on stage.  Over the next three days, the event careened between spotlighting gender equality with awards and speeches, and disrespecting women in practice.  Fake breasts and forced kisses Talking about diversity is not enough to effect change. But, ironically, scandal sometimes is. The rampant displays of sexism and sexual harassment during the gala conference dinner at the Estoril Casino (a venue that inspired Ian Fleming’s Casino Royale) left so many participants and WAN-IFRA employees shaken, that they ultimately triggered significant action. The evening began with a joke from the MC comparing fake news with breasts. The punchline: in both cases he prefers the fakes. One goal for the sexists.  Then came the editorial leadership awards given to outstanding female editors from Uganda and Jordan. One (important) goal for women in news. And finally, a closer so awful that many of us present (including WAN-IFRA employees we’ve spoken with) were in shock. At the end of the dinner, the head of the Portuguese press association, Joao Palmeiro, persuaded a group of women who organized the conference to join him on stage, before asking one of them to tie tablecloths around the necks of the others, saying he was giving them wings: “They are my angels and I don’t know if I am prepared to share them with you.” Palmeiro (a former WAN-IFRA Board member) continued, calling himself ‘Charlie’ and declaring: “In the name of all of you, I am going to kiss Christin!”. WAN-IFRA’s Senior Project Manager Christin Herger was one of a number of employees on stage. (Watch the cringe-inducing video) The audience applauded. And gasped. Christin Herger visibly bristled and withdrew from Palmeiro’s forced kiss, but he was undeterred. “She’s shy, please, please, and I hope you, Portuguese girl, are not so shy,” he said before grabbing the Portuguese WAN-IFRA employee Maria Belem and kissing her instead, despite her obvious discomfort. As he exited the stage, Palmeiro thanked the line-up of women and called them his ‘dream team’, making much of the fact they were all women. He was aiming for ‘gender balance’, you see. Ironically, a new WAN-IFRA-produced handbook on combating sexual harassment in the media was launched during the conference. Maria Belem, one of the women on whom Palmeiro had imposed himself, posted this message on the official conference app after the event: “We are not angels, and we do not work for Charlie. We are professionals working for press freedom and towards a healthy media ecosystem.” When ‘platforming’ sexual harassment triggers change Here’s the good news: despite the (at times) overt sexism and sexual harassment on display during the World News Congress, the events set off a chain reaction that has deepened foundational reform at WAN-IFRA and delivered a chance for much needed reflection within the industry as a whole. When social media activism called out the misogyny in Estoril, it became a #metoo moment for journalism events. In response to expressions of outrage – both on and offline – WAN-IFRA publicly apologized, openly reflected on the incidents, issued a statement of condemnation via the World Editors Forum, and announced the promotion of women on its board.  The Chair of WAN-IFRA’s board, former Vice Chairman of the New York Times Michael Golden, went on stage the morning after the gala dinner to address the crisis: “Last night what happened on the stage…with Joao Palmeiro calling up the staff was inappropriate. He imposed himself on our staff – on Christin Herger, on Maria Belem – in a way that made them uncomfortable and that made many people uncomfortable. I am here to say that that was not appropriate. I am here to apologise to our staff for what happened last night and to say that we recognise the extraordinary work they have done and that they did not deserve to be put in that situation.”  Palmeiro stepped up to the stage next, saying sorry “…from the bottom of my heart” (WATCH: Palmeiro apology). However, that apology seems hollow when viewed in the context of an interview he gave later that day to journalist Yusuf Omar (WATCH: Palmeiro interview). Echoing sentiments that had been hinted at by WAN-IFRA executives, Palmeiro blamed his behaviour on Portuguese culture, claiming that such conduct was “absolutely OK” and “normal” in Portugal.  But that was not a view shared by Portuguese women, including those on the stage: “I felt humiliated as a professional, as a woman and as a Portuguese person, it was not cultural,” one told us. In the aftermath, WAN-IFRA announced South African Editor Lisa MacLeod as the new vice president of its board (which represents many of the world’s biggest news brands) – the first woman in the organisation’s 70 year history to hold the position. It also publicised the appointment of two new women to the board, and the promotion of four women to the board’s Executive Committee. But it remains heavily male dominated, with women still comprising just 14% of board members (The World Editors Forum board has achieved 35% female representation). Nevertheless, WAN-IFRA CEO Vincent Peyregne celebrated the progress, acknowledging that: “We have a lot more to achieve in the coming months.”  #TimesUp for newsrooms, publishers and event organizers worldwide The Palmeiro incident didn’t happen in isolation. It followed a sexist trajectory deeply rooted in stigmas that marginalize women across all news organizations (and throughout society). Though many can point proudly to diversity goals displayed on corporate websites, and the injection of influential female voices into content and conference programs, women in the media continue to be under-represented in bylines, behind editor’s desks, and in boardrooms. They’re also still paid substantially less than their male counterparts. Our industry has a responsibility to lead on gender equality in, and through, the media – broader social change depends upon it.   And we, members of the international journalism community, are not prepared to sit through another ‘manel’, support organisations that disingenuously claim credit for gender equality initiatives, nor stay silent when female colleagues are sexually harassed before our eyes. We are done pandering to the egos of change-resistant influential men in the hope that our gentle lead will eventually encourage them to join us on a meander towards gender equality in the news business. Time is well and truly up. 14 principles of gender equality for the news industry  Here are 14 principles and recommendations for the global news publishing community to use when auditing their efforts on gender equality, and on diversity more broadly – some of which were inspired by WAN-IFRA’s pioneering Women In News Summit  1. Insist on gender equality in and through the media: Globally women represent well under 30%  of leadership positions in newsrooms making the narrative of most publications skewed to the male perspective. Recent studies also show that mainstream newspaper journalists and commentators are dominated by men talking about what other men are doing. This imbalance is directly reflected in content, and in curation of panels and moderators at events throughout the news industry. It’s 2018 –  push back and make sure you/your organisation are not contributing to the problem. Bloomberg News’ recipe for embedding gender equality is a useful guide. 2. Use data to drive inclusive representation on panels, in leadership, on stage: “If you can’t count it, you can’t change it.” This great point from Joanne Lipman is an important starting place. Most organizations feel that gender inequality is not their problem. But taking the time to map and measure is the only way to be sure. Track the gender of bylined authors, sources, speakers and editors to see how balanced your teams and content really are. Simply counting can lead to change. (Read about/listen to Lipman’s approach to leveraging data in the cause). Check out the BBC 50:50 gender balance challenge created by Ros Atkins, and see the toolkit produced by Gender Avenger. Also consider sharing these metrics so you can be held accountable in a spirit of transparency which should also help build trust in your organisation.  3. Call out sexual harassment and tackle it head on (on and offline): “I deeply believe we need an overall code of conduct for men to LEARN how not to treat women in professional setting. There is a lot to learn,” Mariana Santos, Founder of ChicasPoderosas, has said. News organizations certainly need  detailed policies that deal decisively with harassment –  on and offline. See Press Forward’s resources and read Julie Posetti’s 11-step guide to managing online harassment in newsrooms. 4. Don’t ghettoise gender-equality initiatives: Schedule/feature content designed to empower women sources, journalists and editors on the main program, center stage, and on the front page. This is vital if the issues are to be taken seriously, and to ensure male participants are also educated and motivated to embrace change and collaborate on gender equality initiatives. “To relegate issues about women is double-binding – because it makes it a ghetto”– Catarina Carvalho, Editor in Chief, Global Media Group, Portugal 5. Conference organizers: create opportunities for women’s active participation Consider sponsoring women (particularly those in low socio-economic circumstances) speakers and moderators – they generally have less economic power than their male counterparts. And what about sponsoring creche places to accommodate female professionals with primary care responsibilities for young children? (See also Hannah Storm’s 13 suggestions for a more inclusive conference.) 6. Insist your partner organisations and contracted contributors abide by principles of gender equality: Ensure all conference partners, sponsors, moderators and speakers are aware of, have access to, and abide by organisational policies and codes of conduct on sexual harassment and gender equality to avoid a repeat of the Estoril incidents. WAN-IFRA has a policy in development – could it become a model for the industry? 7. Sponsors: consider using the funding stick to enforce gender equality standards Sponsors of journalism/media conferences and events should make funding contingent upon gender balance in the content, or directly fund female speakers and moderators. Audit content thoroughly after events and publication, and consider withholding funding if equality is not achieved as promised. Facebook, Google, Twitter, we’re looking at you (along with an array of Northern European media development funds and intergovernmental organisations). Alternatively, perhaps consider the carrot of a funding bonus for success? 8. Share the platform: If your event must include speakers or panels from partner organisations or sponsors, insist they nominate a woman/women with expertise. And if you’re a male executive asked to represent your organisation as a speaker, consider nominating a more junior woman to take your place. Experience grows from opportunity. 9. Mind conversation culture: Male dominance on panels and in meetings, interruption of women who are speaking, or explaining to women things they are perfectly aware of (‘mansplaining’) are the most common ways that women’s voices are silenced in work environments. Making your team sensitive to this and measuring contributions with simple apps (like this one) can help foster an environment where women can thrive.  10. Edit bias out of your hiring and selection  processes: The human brain is designed to use bias to navigate complex reality. It is not, however, designed to create equitable hiring and panelist selection procedures. We have to do that bit by hand. For help, see Iris Bohnet’s (Harvard Kennedy School) recommendations on designing a bias free organization.  11. Sponsorship from the top: Achieving balance can’t happen as a grass-roots initiative. Without buy-in from the top, gender initiatives will pop up and peter out. Men sponsoring talented women for promotion is one of the best ways to set an example for management and build diversity into leadership. Adam Grant has some great advice on how to do this if men in your organization are nervous about mentoring and sponsoring women in the post-Weinstein world.  12. To pay equally, negotiate differently: The gender pay gap exists in part because men are brought up to be brave and women are brought up to be nice. Orit Kopel, CEO of the Wikipedia foundation and co-founder of WikiTribune, says that the responsibility for equal pay rests with the employer, not the employee. To pay women equally, don’t abuse women’s tendency to undervalue their contribution – give raises to those who deserve them, rather than to those who demand them.  13. Let women pull back and lean in when ready: Just because a woman refuses promotion when she wants to focus more on her family, doesn’t mean she will never want to put her career in high gear again. Many women choose to focus on their children when they are small. Once kids reach a certain level of independence, their parents’ capacity to ‘lean in’ tends to rebound in a big way. So, if a star player refuses once, try again. 14. Apply all of the above in reference to diversity more broadly. This includes race, class, and sexual orientation.  If you’d like to add your name to the list of signatories below — regardless of your gender — please do so here.

Grab said it began a fare subsidy scheme last Monday, June 18, in response to the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to suspend the company’s P2-per-minute travel charge. In a statement on Tuesday, Grab said its drivers should ideally be earning at least P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour. “Based on our computations, a TNVS (transport network vehicle service) driver needs to make at least P330 per hour to be able to properly provide for his family’s needs and to cope with the traffic, high fuel, and vehicle maintenance costs,” said Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu. “Since [the] P2-per-minute component was suspended, we received a lot of painful complaints from our partners that their earnings are not sufficient anymore to make a decent living. That’s why we decided to step in.” The subsidy will be provided to drivers for trips that fall below P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour. Grab gave this example to illustrate how the subsidy would work: “If a ride from Makati to BGC (Bonifacio Global City) takes an hour because of heavy traffic despite short distance, and fare is computed at P120 only, Grab will return to the driver the P210 difference to make sure he made P330 for that one-hour trip.” The ride-hailing company reiterated on Tuesday that there continues to be a vehicle shortage on its platform, with only 33,000 cars available for 600,000 to 800,000 passenger bookings a day. “With guaranteed earnings, we hope that this subsidy will also urge our partners to be more confident that they will make money for any trip they get and continue providing quality service to the riding public,” Cu said. He added that the subsidy is different from incentives which are “only a bonus for drivers who hit a certain number of rides.” The subsidy will be in place, according to Cu, “as long as it’s needed” and the company still has funds for it. Grab has been criticized for alleged overcharging and “deteriorating” service, after it acquired Uber last March. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), which is reviewing the Grab-Uber deal, said that Grab has taken control of 93% of the local ride-hailing market, leaving commuters on the losing end. The LTFRB has since accredited 5 new ride-hailing companies, but the PCC does not expect these firms to challenge Grab’s dominance anytime soon “because it would take a significant amount of time and cost to build a driver and rider base.” Grab maintains that it does not charge illegal fares, but launched a “100-day improvement plan to improve driver and rider experience” in response to complaints of poor service. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/205242-harry-kane-england-tunisia-belgium-panama-fifa-world-cup/","title":"Kane grabs late winner for England, Belgium beats Panama","date":"Jun 19, 2018 8:20 AM PHT","snippet":"Sweden defeats South Korea with a VAR-given penalty","body":"   VOLGOGRAD, Russia – Harry Kane grabbed a dramatic late winner for England on Monday, June 18, powering home a header in injury time of their World Cup opener after Belgium had earlier swept past Panama.

Diego now faces a formal complaint over the alleged incident.   But in an interview on TV Patrol that aired on Saturday, June 16, Diego, son of actors Cesar Montano and Teresa Loyzaga, said Grab Car driver John Ronnel Paglalunan lied. Diego said he was not drunk and he did not attack either the driver or the vehicle along in Manila on Friday, June 15.  The Pusong Ligaw actor had apparently been asleep in his vehicle when it made an abrupt turn because John Ronnel allegedly almost hit his convoy. The Grab Car driver, meanwhile, claimed Diego’s convoy made the abrupt actions and even beat the red light.  Diego said he went down his vehicle and attempted to speak to the driver. “I tried to approach the driver and talk to him. I said peace to him and what did he do? He just put up his phone and started taking a video of me. Nabastos ako doon (I thought that was a rude thing to do),” he said.

I’ve had troubles in my past. But just because someone screwed up in the past, it doesn’t make them the bad person forever,” he said.  Diego’s camp has since gotten in touch with the owner of the vehicle, who has apparently expressed willingness to retract the allegations if proven that it was John Ronnel who caused the incident.  Teresa Loyzaga has also accused the Grab Car driver of making up stories and of almost causing an accident. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/204800-toyota-investment-ride-hailing-company-grab-asia/","title":"Toyota investing $1 billion in Grab","date":"Jun 13, 2018 10:50 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The Japanese automaker plans to expand beyond its core business into the 'mobility' sector","body":" TOKYO, Japan (UPDATED) – Toyota said Wednesday, June 13, it was investing $1 billion in Asia ride-share company Grab, as the Japanese automaker looks to expand beyond its core business into the “mobility” sector. Grab, which is headquartered in Singapore, is a leading player in the ride-share industry in Asia, and earlier this year agreed to acquire US giant Uber’s regional operations. In a statement, Toyota said the deal “is aimed at achieving connectivity for Grab’s rental car fleet across Southeast Asia, and at rolling out various connected services throughout the region that utilize vehicle data” stored by Toyota. Toyota will place one of its executives on Grab’s board, and a second Toyota team member will serve as an executive officer at the company, which Toyota called the “partner of choice for ride-hailing in the region.” The investment comes as Toyota works to adapt to what company president Akio Toyoda calls “profound change” in the industry. Last month, Toyoda pledged to transform the auto giant to meet a “once-in-a-century challenge.” “I have decided to transform Toyota from a car manufacturer to a mobility company,” he said, without offering much detail on what that would entail beyond providing “various services involving movement of people around the world.” Grab operates across Asia and agreed to acquire Uber’s Southeast Asian business earlier this year. The deal has run into trouble though, with Singapore saying in April that it would impose restrictions on the acquisition until it concludes a probe into whether the sale may have infringed competition rules.

If the congressman is fair, he should also look into other transport sectors whose drivers work even longer hours earning less,' says Grab Philippines head Brian Cu","body":" MANILA, Philippines – PBA Partylist Representative Jericho Nograles accused ride-hailing company Grab Philippines of forcing its drivers to work in “slave-like” conditions. In a statement on Thursday, June 7, Nograles said the ride-hailing company subjects its partner-drivers to unfair profit sharing mechanisms and “humanly impossible” quotas for incentives. “With no financial and health risk, Grab is making a lot money, while the drivers who are working in slave-like conditions are left without any protection. To me, this is immoral and this is utterly wrong. This has to stop now and put Grab to the place where it really belongs,” Nograles said. Grab drivers who attended a consultation meeting with Nograles revealed that their take-home pay is only about P655 per day after working a minimum of 18 hours, the lawmaker said. The average commission of Grab per day amounts to P600, he added. Nograles had accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge has since been suspended. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) The lawmaker said he would support the petition to implement fare changes if Grab Philippines foregoes of the 20% commission they charge from drivers, and to only take the P40 base fare per ride. “I will definitely back up the driver’s petition to implement the fair charges, on the condition that Grab Philippines forego any commission from this charge,” Nograles said. Reimpose P2 per minute In a statement late Thursday, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said: “No one among Grab parters is being forced to drive long hours. If the congressman is fair, he should also look into other transport sectors whose drivers work even longer hours earning less.” Cu then again raised Grab Philippines’ appeal with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to reimpose the suspended P2-per-minute travel charge. “[I]n the spirit of fairness, we also urge him to enjoin all TNCs (transport network companies), which all have LTFRB-approved per-minute fare component in their fare structures, to forego their commissions, as he suggests,” Cu said. Grab earlier said the suspension of the charge led to fewer drivers, with only 35,000 drivers available for over 600,000 bookings a day. Cu said Nograles’ earlier accusation of illegal charges caused the drivers’ income to “drop drastically.” “Nograles actually caused drivers’ income to drop drastically when he questioned the legality of the P2 per minute fare component…. Without the P2, many drivers stopped driving, making commuting more difficult for the riding public,” Cu said. “Throughout the past months, he certainly has not been a constructive force in helping both drivers and the riding public,” he added. This is the latest move by the lawmaker in a bid to regulate Grab Philippines. Grab still dominates the Philippine ride-hailing market after the exit of Uber last April. The LTFRB recently approved 5 new companies that would challenge Grab, but most have yet to be operational in Metro Manila.

In a statement on Wednesday, May 30, Grab said it had received the PCC’s Statement of Concerns (SOC) dated May 22, where the antitrust watchdog said that the Grab-Uber deal “has resulted and will likely continue to result in a substantial lessening of competition” in the market. The SOC is part of the PCC’s ongoing review of the deal. Grab again argued that there are too many passengers and not enough vehicles. (READ: Grab: Only 35,000 drivers serve 600,000 bookings per day) “We are of the view that any perceived increase in price is not an exercise of any market power, but the result of demand and supply imbalance given the current shortage of available drivers and the regulatory constraint relating to the transport network vehicle service (TNVS) cap, which are outside of our control,” Grab said. This demand and supply imbalance, added Grab, “is likely to be temporary” because the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has since accredited 5 other ride-hailing companies – MiCab, HirNa, Owto, Go Lag, and Hype. But the PCC’s Mergers and Acquisitions Office (MAO) found that the new industry players are unlikely to provide much of a challenge to Grab – at least not in the near future. With Uber’s exit, Grab now controls 93% of the ride-hailing market. “Such entry of competitors would not be timely, likely, and sufficient because it would take a significant amount of time and cost to build a driver and rider base sufficient to contest the incumbent,” said the PCC. ‘Deteriorating’ service As for complaints about poor service, Grab noted that it recently launched a “100-day improvement plan to improve driver and rider experience.” One of the top complaints is driver cancellation, though Grab earlier claimed that riders are more likely to cancel than drivers. The PCC, however, had said that its data show “prices are increasing, while quality of service is deteriorating, to the detriment of the riding public.” Grab, according to the PCC, also increased the frequency of its surge pricing. The commission’s MAO based its findings on “total observations of 27,648 booking requests over 3 phases” as well as “mystery shopper surveys (a total quota of 1,104 rides),” conducted before and after Uber exited the market on April 16. “Passenger surveys and interviews… indicate more driver cancellations, forced cancellation of rides, and longer waiting times,” said the PCC. In response to these findings, Grab said it would share its own market analysis with the PCC, to show that its deal with Uber “has no anti-competitive effect.” The company will file a formal reply to address the points in the SOC. “We hope that the PCC will fairly assess our arguments and sit down with us to discuss how to address any issues that the PCC may identify moving forward,” the company said. Illegal fares? In a separate statement, Grab also maintained that its fares are “legal and upfront,” denying the allegations of PBA Representative Jericho Nograles that it charges illegal rates. Nograles earlier claimed Grab had an unauthorized charge of P2 per minute of travel and a supposedly illegal P80 minimum fare. The LTFRB suspended the P2 per minute charge – a decision that’s under appeal – and also said it was not informed about the minimum fare. Grab said a 2015 order from the Department of Transportation (DOTr) allowed transport network companies (TNCs) to set their own fares without LTFRB approval. “Congressman Jericho Nograles may be rocking the boat for his political ends, not really to protect the riding public. Proof is his own bill in Congress wants the TNCs to set their own fares, exactly what he is opposing now,” said Grab public affairs head Leo Gonzales. In response, Nograles told Rappler that “Grab cannot change the facts through press releases.” The lawmaker added: “Grab advertised that they don’t charge per-minute fees, when in fact they did. Grab admitted under oath that they did not inform the riding public, the LTFRB, or the drivers and operators when they implemented the illegal fees on June 5, 2017. Let’s wait for the decision of the [LTFRB] in a few days.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/203634-thewrap-may-29-2018-evening-edition/","title":"Duterte certifies BBL as urgent, LTFRB on Grab, COA on OGCC | Evening wRap","date":"May 29, 2018 7:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch Rappler's evening newscast with Marguerite de Leon","body":"Today on Rappler: President Rodrigo Duterte certifies as urgent the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law. President Rodrigo Duterte voices an interest in the vote recount for the 2016 vice presidential race. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board says it was ‘not informed’ that ride-hailing company Grab is charging passengers minimum fares. The Commission on Audit says 5 government corporate lawyers in the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel directly received allowances from their state clients, which were all untaxed and exceeded the allowable amount. United States President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agree  that it is ‘imperative’ to completely dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program. "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/203601-ltfrb-not-informed-grab-philippines-minimum-fare/","title":"LTFRB not informed of Grab’s minimum fares","date":"May 29, 2018 2:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab has been charging a minimum fare of P80 for its sedan and 6-seater vehicles, and P125 for premium cars","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) officials on Tuesday, May 29, said they “were not informed” that ride-hailing company Grab would be charging passengers minimum fares. Visibly surprised by the information, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III asked Grab representatives during a hearing when the minimum fares were imposed. Grab lawyer Miguel Aguila said they started on June 5, 2017. “Ayusin ’nyo nga ’yung papel ’nyo. Ang gulo,” Delgra told Grab. (Fix your papers. It’s a mess.) PBA Representative Jericho Nograles informed the LTFRB in a hearing on Tuesday that Grab Philippines charges “illegal” minimum fares, which “were not declared” by the ride-hailing company,  Nograles said Grab charges a minimum of P80 for its sedan and 6-seater vehicles, while the premium cars start at P125. In response to a question, Delgra said during a media interview that the board was not informed of charges separate from the flagdown rate of P40. “Obviously, [we were] not [informed] insofar as the computation of minimum fare is concerned – compared to the base fare and in relation to the other factors to determine the fare,” Delgra said. Delgra said the LTFRB is not yet considering suspending Grab’s minimum fares, but the board needs a clarification on the matter. “We won’t necessarily remove this, but we are asking for clarification. We are only following the 4 elements in determining fares,” he said in Filipino.  Delgra said that the fares depend on the computation of the flagdown rate, the distance traveled, time charges, and the surge pricing. Under the government-approved fares, Grab charges an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer and has a surge cap of twice the distance traveled on top of the flagdown fare. Grab said that it was never the company’s intention to “hide” the fare from its patrons. “What you see on the app, that is an upfront fare. If it is a minimum distance, it’s a minimum fare, we never tried to hide it from the general public,” Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said. Illegal charges? Nograles earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge has since been suspended. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) The lawmaker’s allegation prompted an LTFRB hearing to determine the validity of the travel charges. “If they truly subject themselves to the board, then why didn’t they apply to the board? Their only formal application for it was January of this year, way after they unilaterally imposed it,” Nograles said. The lawmaker said Grab’s move puts into question the authority of LTFRB as a regulatory agency. LTFRB earlier said they were not consulted either when the P2-per-minute fare was initially charged.  The ride-hailing company’ legal counsel argued that the P2-per-minute charge was added to cover the costs of the drivers when picking up the passenger at their pinned location in the Grab app. During the hearing, Delgra asked Grab to submit to the board the company’s earnings since the P2-per-minute charge was imposed. For the drivers Winson Esteras, leader of the coalition of transport network vehicle services, said on Tuesday that the P2-per-minute charge helps drivers cope with the costs incurred by longer travel time due to traffic congestion. “Kung mapapansin ‘nyo naman na hindi na talaga kami kumikita…. Pa’no ‘yung traffic? ‘Yung fare ngayon hindi na aligned sa sinisingil na gas sa amin,” Esteras said. (If you notice, we’re not earning a lot…. How about the traffic? The fare now is not aligned with the cost of gas.) Grab Philippines had admitted that its riders were not informed when the additional charges were rolled out starting June 5, 2017.  They argued that this is legal and asked for it to be reimposed, saying that it is for the drivers’ benefit. Grab still dominates the Philippine ride-hailing market after the exit of Uber last April. The LTFRB recently approved 5 new companies that would challenge Grab, but most have yet to be operational in Metro Manila.

In a statement, Nograles said this minimum fare was not authorized by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “Without any public hearing, Grab Philippines again unilaterally imposed a new illegal fare condition. [D]uring the April 17 LTFRB hearing, Grab Philippines denied to the board that they impose an P80 minimum fare,” Nograles said. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated transport network companies’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. “Now, no less than the Grab app publicly declares that the company charges the same minimum fare. This brazen act shows not only disrespect to the regulators, but proof that Grab Philippines has no intention to follow Philippine laws,” Nograles said. “This is a usurpation of the powers of the LTFRB and this is a violation of our existing laws. Just because they now have a virtual monopoly of our TNVS (transport network vehicle services) sector, they can now violate our laws by setting their own fare rates?” he added. Under the information card on the Grab app, its sedan and 6-seater vehicles for hire charge a minimum of P80 per ride, while the premium cars start at P125. Nograles said that under the approved fare structure, a rider should only be charged a maximum of P68 for a 500-meter ride at a surge rate of times two. It should not be at P80, he said. The lawmaker earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) He said the ride-hailing company owes its riders a refund of at least P1.8 billion for a 5-month period. A hearing on the matter is set for Tuesday, May 29. Grab has yet to issue a statement on Nograles’ new accusation. Meanwhile, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said she is unaware of the P80 minimum fare. “Not that I know of. [I] will check,” Lizada told reporters.

In a petition filed before the LTFRB, Grab Philippines argued that the suspension was an “infringement” of the equal protection clause guaranteed by the Philippine Constitution. A copy of the petition dated May 22 was made available to media on Friday, May 25. “It is clear that members of the Honorable Board who issued the order suspending the per-minute charge of the petitioner have caused undue injury and prejudice to the petitioner,” Grab said. They also said that the suspension of the charge “gave unwarranted benefits and advantage” to other transportation network companies, arguing that operators and drivers will “transfer” to other ride-hailing companies given the situation. (READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?) Grab Philippines also said that a motion for reconsideration on the suspension was filed, meaning the suspension should have been delayed and should not have been rendered “immediately executory.” “Since the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration by the petitioner on April 20, 2018 has the effect of staying the April 19, 2018 order, petitioner then has the legal authority to resume the imposition of the P2-per-minute charge pending the resolution of the motion,” Grab said. PBA Representative Jericho Nograles had accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge has since been suspended. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) In a text message to Rappler, Nograles said Grab’s petition is “unfounded.” “Their petition is unfounded since reimposition means it was legal in the first place. It was never approved therefore there is nothing to reimpose,” Nograles said on Friday. “They dont have the moral authority to talk about equal protection of the laws when they have admitted that they have never conducted a public hearing for the P2-per-minute [charge],” Nograles added. Under the government-approved fare scheme, Grab can only charge a flagdown rate of P40 and an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer, a December 2016 order said. Grab earlier admitted that riders were not informed of the travel charges when first added to their fares mid-2017.

The prize will be given to the top 5 teams in the national event featuring 21 sports and 96 local government unit (LGU) delegations.  Luzon will field the most number of teams at 28, followed by Mindanao (27), Visayas (26), and the National Capital Region (15) in the games organized by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC).  PSC commissioner Ramon “El Presidente” Fernandez, the PNG overall chairman, said the cash prize will serve as PSC’s assistance to the sports  programs of the best LGU teams in the week-long event. National team members will see action, except for the Philippine track and field athletes due to a schedule conflict with the National Open.  According to Fernandez, the PNG was originally set last December but got pushed back due to the “clean up” campaign of the PSC and the national sports associations. “This is the elite of the elite, the cream of the crop athletes in our country, national team members will represent their LGUs and we envision for the PNG to become the Philippine Olympics,” said Fernandez, who added that the multi-sporting event will later on serve as one of the tryouts for the national teams.  The PNG has been one of PSC’s talent identification program and has also served as an assessment tournament for the national team members’ performance.  Cebuano hospitality Teams will compete in 21 sports with Cebu hosting athletics, archery, arnis, badminton, boxing, chess, cycling, dancesport, judo, karatedo, sepak takraw, softball, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, triathlon, volleyball, and weightlifting. Most of the events will be held in the city except for duathlon and triathlon, which will be held in Tabuelan, northwest Cebu; cycling in Danao City, also north of Cebu; and the women’s division of lawn tennis in Naga City, south of Cebu. Gymnastics and rugby football will be held in Manila due to lack of international standard facilities here.  Joint hosts Cebu City and Cebu Province promised to welcome the teams with warm Cebuano hospitality, but noted that the province will be all business once action kicks off.   “We are the hosts, we want them to feel welcomed in Cebu, but we want to beat them also,” said Cebu City Sports Commission chairman Edward Hayco during a press conference last Thursday, May 17, at the Cebu City Sports Center, where most events will be contested. Cebu Provincial Sports Commission executive director Atty. Ramil Abing, PSC PNG head secretariat Annie Ruiz and PSC Visayas’ Nonie Lopez also graced the press conference. Fernandez added that the PSC plans to make PNG a biennial event to align it with the Southeast Asian Games. By doing this, the basketball legend said it will make the PNG more prestigious and turn it into an event that athletes will really look forward to. Opening ceremonies As the PNG returns to Cebu after 21 years, it will have no less than Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte as the keynote speaker during the opening ceremonies on Saturday afternoon, May 19, at the Cebu City Sports Center. The last time that Cebu hosted the PNG was in 1997.  The President will be joined by Cebu Province Gov. Hilario Davide III and Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña. The opening ceremonies itself will be something to look forward to, according to Ricky Ballesteros, a multi-awarded Milo Little Olympics organizer, who has been tapped to oversee the program.  Ballesteros said the opening program will be an event to remember, noting that it will be very modern but interwoven with the Cebuano culture.  All regional delegations will be highlighted during the parade of athletes in the opening ceremonies, which will feature dancers garbed in regional “lighted” costumes, said Ballesteros. Ballesteros also promised that the lighting of “the urn of peace and unity” will be unique and will feature Fernandez along with Philippine sports heroes led by Olympic silver medalist and Filipino weightlifting star Hidilyn Diaz. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/202665-micab-eddie-ybanez-interview-ridesharing-issues/","title":"WATCH: 6 questions with the founder of new Grab competitor, Micab","date":"May 17, 2018 10:26 AM PHT","snippet":"Eddie Ybañez speaks to Rappler on what MiCab brings to the ridesharing landscape","body":" MANILA, Philippines – A ridesharing service has set up shop in Manila, promising to supply an additional 5,000 taxis by June to a ridesharing market currently dominated by Grab. Called Micab, the service launched in 2012 in Cebu before expanding to a few other provincial markets. In April this year, it got the nod of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to operate in Manila.  Since Grab acquired chief rival Uber’s Southeast Asia operations in March, the ridesharing market has practically operated in a monopoly. The arrival of Micab, and other upcoming ridesharing services such as Owto, Go Lag, Hype, and Hirna, is expected to restore some balance to the market. For consumers, the arrival of new players sparks hope that it will eventually be faster to book a ride, and that drivers will behave more fairly at the risk of losing customers to other players.  We talked to Eddie Ybañez, founder and CEO of Micab, on how they’ll be addressing issues that currently plague the ridesharing market. Micab’s primary edge against other competitors, says Ybañez, is that it won’t be charging booking fees and do surge pricing because the business is supported by its ad service, MiAds. Watch our quick video above for the rest of his answers or read the transcript below: Q: What’s your edge over the competition? Eddie Ybañez: At Micab, what we’re doing is we’re improving the taxi industry by providing safety, and a more convenient way to hail a ride. But the good thing with this is this promise comes very affordably. Because whatever the existing fare structure is, that’s what passengers have to pay. We don’t have a booking fee or surge pricing. I think that’s what our edge is compared to all the other players.  Q: How many taxis will Micab be able to bring to the ridesharing market?  EY: Our partners are capable of producing, in Manila alone, 15,000. That’s our target. That’s our target but the moment our other fleets sign on, we’ll have more taxis. Our target is about 30,000, maybe. Q: Now we’re at 5,000 in Manila? EY: 5,000 by June.   Q: When do we reach 15,000? EY: We’re targeting early next year to reach 15,000 in Manila. Nationwide, the 15,000-taxi goal is now doable, because they have already signed on.  Q: How are you addressing bad driver behavior?  EY: Before, there was no platform, no system for taxis. It was just the passenger and the driver who knew what was going on during the trip. If the driver did something, only the passenger would know – unless he posts it on Facebook or something.  But with Micab now, passengers have the power to report, to rate the driver, to commend the driver or file a complaint. The moment a 3-star rating is reported – even without details – our customer service will call the passenger and driver to investigate. Depending on the severity of the complaint, the drivers may be forced to go under re-training, or they will be taken off the platform, penalized by the operator, or if it’s a criminal offense, government agencies can step in, and impose penalties.   The driver’s license can get suspended for the next 3 months, 6 months or 1 year – that’s an existing ruling at the LTFRB. We’re actually sharing the system with the taxi operators and the government agencies.  Q: Will drivers see their passenger’s destination prior to accepting a trip? This has been seen as a reason why drivers are able to cancel on and pick passengers at will.  EY: Brainstorming on the decision whether to retain the driver’s ability to see passenger destination or not was tough. But eventually, the decision for us to allow the driver to see the destination won.  Why? As much as possible, we don’t want confrontations. We don’t want them to fight in the streets just because, say, a driver finds out that the destination is Bulacan. They might just end up fighting.   But since we’re allowing that, we’re limiting the number of times a driver can ignore or reject a request.  The moment a driver rejects 3 requests in one day, they will be blocked in the system for a day.  This will affect their rating. The moment they reach a 3-star average rating, they won’t be able to get passengers unless they do re-training.  Q: What happens when a passenger reports a driver who asks for additional fees?   EY: The operations team will investigate the incident. When they investigate, we’ll have access to their conversation on the app. So we can trace that. So passengers are actually protected. If a driver asks for a fixed contract rate for a trip, which is illegal, we can even report that to the LTFRB.  There’s a record of the conversation between passenger and driver. There’s evidence.   This is the big difference between now and then. Now there’s someone looking at them. The drivers themselves will behave better knowing that someone is monitoring them, like a parent to a child. Q: How fast can a passenger book a ride?  EY: Currently, we average 10 minutes, but we’re still ramping up in Manila. We haven’t even launched officially, but we’re operational already. The app is downloadable already. There are around an extra 1,000 cabs [about to be activated].  But we’re trying really that by the end of June, we have 5,000 cabs.  Hopefully, the moment more cabs get enabled – it’s just supply and demand, really – ride acceptance becomes faster. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/202049-grab-philippines-passengers-cancellation-fee/","title":"Grab plans to impose fee on riders who cancel trips","date":"May 8, 2018 6:30 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing company plans to begin charging passengers for trip cancellations within the next 100 days. The amount is still undetermined.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing company Grab Philippines is planning to impose a fee on riders for trip cancellations. In a media briefing on Tuesday, May 8, Grab Philippines marketing head Cindy Toh said there are ongoing discussions to roll out the feature in a few months. “Grab is eyeing to impose a cancellation fee – our target [is] that this will be done within the [next] 100 days,” Toh said. According to Toh, riders are more likely to cancel their bookings than drivers. Data showed that passengers cancel 12% of their rides, while drivers cancel 8% of their bookings. Imposing a cancellation fee is seen as a solution – a feature that Uber used to have. But Grab has yet to determine how much the fee will be, and how to roll out the feature for trips paid with cash. “For sure, we can implement it for credit card users. The challenge we encounter is for riders paying in cash,” Toh said. She added that Grab will soon issue new receipts which will indicate the fare breakdown of every trip. “On the new receipt, you should be able to see the surge rate and the base fare, how many kilometers ang travel mo (your travel was). That is already a work in progress,” Toh said. PBA Representative Jericho Nograles had accused Grab of charging an additional P2 per minute on top of its government-approved scheme. He pointed out that Grab’s receipts do not show the trip’s fare breakdown. The charge has since been suspended by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) Better service Grab is at the center of controversy over its drivers’ behavior, with Filipinos complaining of “poor service” after it bought Uber’s Southeast Asia operations. Toh said they are committed to improving customer experience by updating their drivers’ code of conduct, as well as implementing a new set of guidelines for passenger behavior. “We impose a maximum cancellation of one per day for our drivers. From our current driver cancellation of 8%, we should be able to reduce that by half or 4%,” Toh said. Grab will also expand its driver academy, which will include modules on road courtesy, customer service, and data privacy. Performance incentives will also be enhanced and a driver rewards program will be in place. Toh said all these will be done within their 100-day campaign.

On the tech side of things, they’re rolling out a new app interface for both iOS and Android.  Visually, the revamped interface cleans all the clutter in the home screen and divides Grab’s services to two tabs, namely Transport and Delivery. What’s more is that pinning locations in the map is now said to be more intuitive, and has been designed to make it easier for passengers and drivers to locate each other.   But for passengers who feel they have had a bad experience with the service, the key update is the new ability to report their concerns to Grab’s Help Center without leaving the app. The hope is it will expedite the filing of concerns, and encourage consumers to voice out their issues via the help center. To support the improved intergration, the ride-hailing service also announced that they’re enlarging their customer service team by partnering with a BPO company, which they expect to be fully operational by July. With the expansion of the cusomter service team, Grab said that they’re ensuring reports are resolved within 48 hours. After Uber’s exit, Grab has been in the spotlight for several issues including higher fares, misbehaving drivers, and long wait time for rides.  The in-app Emergency button, added in July of last year, is getting some added features and a name change. Now called the SOS button, passengers can directly connect to 911 and send text messages to three registered phone numbers in-app in case of emergencies. This new button is going to be launched starting June 4 this year.  “Our aim is to be passengers’ partner for better trips at all times. We have carefully studied new features that will further enhance our services while ensuring passenger safety on the road,” Cindy Toh, Country Marketing Head, said.  Grab also said plans to expand destination masking beyond the 25% of drivers with low acceptance rates are under review. According to them, the introduction of destination masking late last month had a bigger negative impact on ride acceptance rather than ride cancellations. They believe this could make it harder for passengers to book a ride if they expand beyond the initial number.  The revamped app interface has already started rolling out for iOS and is expected for Android by July 2018. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/201597-grab-philippines-drivers-not-enough-passenger-bookings/","title":"Grab: Only 35,000 drivers serve 600,000 bookings per day","date":"May 2, 2018 4:10 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines head Brian Cu also says 'driver numbers continue to drop' after the suspension of the P2-per-minute travel charge","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines said it has an “undersupply” of vehicles to meet passenger demand, with only 35,000 drivers available for 600,000 bookings made per day.

With the recent suspension of P2-per-minute fare, a lot of drivers and operators fear they won’t be able to provide for their families and car maintenance expenses,” Cu said. He added that Grab drivers are not necessarily “choosy” with bookings, but rather demand exceeds supply. “Majority of social media sentiment we monitor regarding the inability to get a ride is due to the perception of choosy drivers, but in reality this is because there are no available cars in the area,” Cu said. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on April 18 suspended Grab’s P2-per-minute travel charge, as the board said it had not approved the additional fare. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) PBA Representative Jericho Nograles had raised the issue of the additional P2-per-minute travel charge, which Grab admitted it started imposing in June 2017 without informing passengers. Nograles is demanding that Grab refund its customers a total of P1.8 billion in alleged overcharged fares for the last 5 months alone. Longer wait Grab said the overflow in demand came after it acquired Uber’s operations, resulting in passengers enduring “longer waits or not getting allocated a vehicle at all.” Cu said that prior to the acquisition, Grab had 24,000 vehicles which were able to serve 60% to 65% of bookings. After the acquisition, Grab only accepted Uber drivers on the LTFRB masterlist. The list consists of drivers who can apply for a franchise from the regulatory board. So, out of 19,000 active Uber drivers, Cu said only 11,000 were able to move to Grab. Around 6,000 or majority of the remaining Uber drivers weren’t on the masterlist and could not switch. “We appeal to the LTFRB to allow the displaced 6,000 Uber drivers who are not part of the masterlist to continue driving with their chosen TNC (transport network company) in order to support the demand,” Cu said. He added that with an average of 12 rides a day, each vehicle will be able to serve an additional 72,000 rides which would “ease the plight of the riders.” The LTFRB earlier raised the “common supply base,” or the number of allowed franchises under transport network vehicle services (TNVS), to 65,000 units in Metro Manila, 1,500 in Metro Cebu, and 250 in Pampanga. The cap was the LTFRB’s attempt to regulate the TNCs and avoid adding more cars to the capital region’s already congested roads. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada told reporters on Wednesday that the cap would be reevaluated every 3 months to see whether it should be increased or decreased based on data. “We need to stress that this is a new denomination. Everyone is working on the fly. It’s still too early to set rigid rules on a technology that is still being tested first by its newness vis-à-vis the owners, drivers, passengers, and competition,” Lizada said.

Rozier emerged as the top scorer in a dazzling Celtics offensive display at the TD Garden, with Al Horford and Jayson Tatum also making hefty contributions. Horford finished with 26 points while Tatum added 28 points as Boston surged into a 1-0 lead in the best-of-7 series with a statement victory. Horford later praised Rozier’s superb contribution. “I’ve always seen that potential in Terry. I just think he’s taken advantage of the opportunity,” Horford said.  “It’s a great experience for him to come into a playoff game of this magnitude and have such a great game,” Horford added. “I just think defensively we did a great job tonight, really containing them and just trying to play with pace at the other end.” The third-seeded Sixers had advanced to the semi-finals after a confident demolition of Miami in the opening round. But the Celtics lineup look to be a vastly more challenging proposition for the Sixers, who saw Joel Embiid top score with 31 points while pulling down 13 rebounds. J.J. Redick had 20 points for the Sixers, while point guard Ben Simmons had 18 points from 41 minutes on the court. Yet it was the shooting prowess of Celtics ace Rozier that caught the eye as the 24-year-old point guard kept Boston firmly on track for a well-earned win. Boston, who advanced to the semi-finals after a gruelling 7-game series win over Milwaukee, have regrouped superbly after a slew of injuries which means they are without stars Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown and Gordon Hayward. Rozier’s 29-point haul included 21 points from three-point range, a 77.8 conversion percentage from outside the arc. Rozier credited his form to a determined training regime launched last year. “Up early every day. Putting in a lot of work, watching a lot of film. A lot of hard work over the summer,” Rozier said. “We got together yesterday and we had a plan. No matter who it is out there, we’re going to play hard and take care of business.” Sixers coach Brett Brown was left to reflect on a below-par night for his team while acknowledging the Celtics had simply been better. “We did have an off night shooting but a lot of that you can attribute to their good defense and them getting to our shooters,” Brown said. “We give them credit. I never really felt we were in the game. It sure felt like we were playing a good team today.  “But defensively, offensively, this isn’t who we are. This was a poor game from us. We’re going to have to fix some things.” Game 2 takes place in Boston on Thursday. – Rappler.com      "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/201022-thewrap-april-25-2018-midday-edition/","title":"Australian nun to be deported, Grab on passenger destination, PH apologizes to Kuwait | Midday wRap","date":"Apr 25, 2018 12:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch Rappler's midday newscast with Marguerite de Leon","body":"Today on Rappler: The Philippines orders Australian nun Patricia Fox to leave the country after forfeiting her missionary visa. Grab drivers will no longer see the destination of their passengers before accepting bookings starting Friday. The Philippines apologizes to Kuwait Tuesday for rescuing abused overseas Filipino workers in the Middle Eastern country through an operation that angered the Kuwaiti government.

Grab said the destination masking will initially be rolled out to 25% of Grab drivers with a historically low acceptance rate. An auto-accept driver-app feature will also be fully rolled out on Friday, which will automatically assign bookings to drivers. This would allow a more seamless experience of accepting passenger requests, according to Grab. “We will implement non-showing of passenger information before ride acceptance, as it is a major source of complaints,” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in a statement on Tuesday, April 24. “For added protection during wee hours of the night, drivers, however, have an option to see passenger destination,” he added. This decision comes after the Singapore-based ride-hailing firm sought the advice of Transportation Undersecretary Thomas Orbos and Assistant Secretary Mark de Leon. (READ: Indonesia’s Go-Jek eyes Philippine ride-hailing market) “We want to vastly improve our services hence our consecutive decisions to sanction 500 errant drivers over the week, and now the non-showing of the passenger destination and the auto-accept feature,” Cu said. Last week, nearly 500 Grab drivers were sanctioned after an internal probe into mounting complaints of canceled ride bookings. According to Grab, some drivers were suspended for 3 to 5 days. No further details or breakdown of the sanctions were given. Cu admitted that Grab’s service is currently “not optimal” with fewer drivers on the road. “Grab is trying its best to keep more drivers on the road to keep up with rider demand and prevent long waits and price surges,” he said. ‘At last’ In a message sent to reporters, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) welcomed Grab’s move to mask passengers’ destinations. “At least now the riders, hopefully, will have less cancellations. We appreciate the move unilaterally done by Grab, that they didn’t wait for an order from the LTFRB,” said LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada in a mix of English and Filipino. PBA Representative Jericho Nograles, who earlier questioned Grab’s P2-per-minute travel charge, pointed out that the destination masking was long overdue. He said it was stated in a September 2015 order from the LTFRB. “Salamat, at last, after 2 1/2 years sinunod na ang order ng LTFRB. Sana naman hindi tayo maghintay ng refund [of the travel charge] for another 2 1/2 years,” Nograles told Rappler in a phone interview. (Thank you, at last, after 2 1/2 years they followed the order of the LTFRB. I hope we don’t wait for a refund of the travel charge for another 2 1/2 years.) The LTFRB suspended the travel charge, but Grab filed an appeal, saying that removing it would “cause irreparable damage” to operators and drivers.

Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu on Monday, April 23, said in a statement that his firm will continue imposing sanctions, like suspension and complete banning from the platform, on drivers with a 10% or above cancellation rate per week. “Only 5% cancellation rate is allowed as metric for incentives… We apologize that our services fell short. However, we will move forward. We have rolled out additional and stricter measures to address issues on cancellations and this is just the start,” Cu said. According to Grab, some drivers were suspended for 3 to 5 days. No further details or breakdown of the sanctions were given. Cu also said his company may sanction passengers who themselves have been reported. (READ: Indonesia’s Go-Jek eyes Philippine ride-hailing market) “While we do our best to further improve driver services, we hope that our passengers would also do their part and exercise the same level of commitment. We encourage our passengers to be responsible by maintaining minimal and valid cancellations and keeping wait time to no more than 7 minutes. Passengers with reported complaints may also face sanctions,” Cu added. Blaming it on LTFRB order Cu, however, also blamed the ride cancellations on the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) order to suspend his company’s P2-per-minute travel charge. “[D]river cancellation rate doubled at 11% last Friday and Saturday (April 20 and 21), and were predominantly driven by low fares. As a result, drivers drove less and Grab was only able to service half of the passenger demand,” he added. The LTFRB’s order came after a complaint lodged by PBA Representative Jericho Nograles. Grab then admitted that its riders were not informed about the P2-per-minute travel charge when it was first implemented in June 2017. After the LTFRB ordered Grab to stop the P2-per-minute travel charge, the ride-hailing firm filed a motion for reconsideration, saying the alleged illegal charge goes to the drivers and not to the company. “[T]he P2-per-minute travel time fare component was legal [based on a 2015 Department of Transportation order], and necessary to protect the livelihood of driver partners while sustaining transport demands of the riding public. [T]he P2 is not a Grab income because 80% goes to the driver directly while the 20% is spent on driver incentives and rider promos,” Cu said. Last Friday, the LTFRB approved Grab’s petition to restore its surge cap to two times from 1.5 times the normal fare. This means that the surge pricing cap is at most twice the rates for time covered and distance traveled only, and not for the base fare. Grab has promised to improve its services for the good of the riding public. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/200765-beauty-mask-asian-basics/","title":"Your head-to-toe guide to Asian beauty masks","date":"Apr 22, 2018 10:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Get your mask on!","body":" Korean face masks often serve as a noob’s gateway to the magical world of Asian beauty products.

There were no comms (communication) to the riders,” Cu said, when asked if Grab riders were informed of the charge through the Grab app or via social media. Cu said that there is no fare breakdown provided to riders as what they are shown upon booking is the “upfront price” or the total fare they pay at the end of the trip.

On Tuesday, the LTFRB conducted a hearing on the alleged illegal charges by Grab Philippines on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) During the hearing, the regulatory board questioned representatives from Grab on how they “unilaterally” changed their fare scheme mid-2017, adding P2 per minute for every ride. “We are very specific how this mechanism was supposed to be implemented when a December 27, 2016 order remains as of today,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said. The December 2016 order regulated ride-hailing services’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. The order does not include travel duration charges. “It is the position of the Board that the December 27, 2016 order mandates the fare structure – therefore there should be no other change in the fare structure, considering the fact that the Board exercised our adjudicatory powers,” Delgra said. The LTFRB instructed Grab to disclose in another hearing – set for May 29 – when exactly the travel duration charge was implemented, and how many rides were affected. It also asked Grab to further explain its algorithm for fare pricing in May. Illegal charges? Grab maintained, however, that it informed the LTFRB of its fare structure in a technical working group (TWG) meeting in July 2017. John Paul Nabua, Grab’s lawyer, said the ride-hailing company started charging the travel duration rate in “early June 2017” and informed the LTFRB about it the following month. As to why Grab implemented the new fare structure without the LTFRB’s approval, Nabua said Department Order (DO) 2015-11 issued by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) allows pricing changes, only “subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of disruptions in the market.” Nabua also said the LTFRB’s December 2016 order mentions the “time travel charge,” and Grab deemed this applicable to ride-hailing firms. But Delgra said the provision does not apply to Grab, as the company did not charge by travel duration prior to the December 2016 order. “Was there a time rate when the order was decided in December 2016?” Delgra asked Grab, and was told, “No.” In response, the LTFRB chairman said, “Then this [provision] does not apply to you.” Refund? PBA Representative Jericho Nograles, who was also present during the hearing as complainant, said Grab only confirmed it did not go through the right process. “First of all, informing [the LTFRB] through a PowerPoint presentation is not a cause for approval. What we are pushing for here is due process for the rights of our consumers. The P2-per-minute charge did not undergo due process,” Nograles told reporters in a mix of English and Filipino. The lawmaker said that based on his calculations, Grab owes its riders some P3.2 billion. Some Grab drivers and operators who were also present during the hearing argued that they would bear the brunt of the refund, should the LTFRB deem the charges illegal. Some senators had also slammed the ride-hailing company’s “predatory pricing and overcharging.” The LTFRB previously ordered Grab to lower its surge pricing cap from multiplied by two times to only 1.5 times the normal fare.

The commission’s order contradicted that of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LFTRB), which ordered Uber to end operations before April 16.

(READ: LTFRB to Grab: Explain ‘illegal’ P2-per-minute travel charge) The PCC went on to reiterate that Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s assets creates a potentially distorted market for ride-hailing. “Grab’s buyout of Uber will mean gobbling up 93% of the ride-hailing market. The accreditation of new TNCs (transport network companies) is a welcome development to allow passengers to have more choices. We note, however, that the incoming TNCs are left with only 7% share in the market,” said the commission. “Established firms have the advantage of an existing user base due to network effects. This means that when you buy a firm, in effect, you also get its customer base,” it added. The PCC said it would take that into consideration during the review to level the playing field. “In the end, the PCC stands with the passengers to protect them from the perils of monopoly,” it concluded.

Senate public services committee chairperson Grace Poe said Grab, as the “surviving” company after buying Uber, has no right to charge consumers higher fares. “There should be no room for predatory pricing by a firm allowed to engage in public service. Being the surviving entity does not authorize Grab to grab more profits,” Poe said in a statement. She added that the government should find a middle ground, saying regulatory agencies should both protect the riding public from exorbitant fees and Grab drivers from low income despite hard work. “I am hopeful that through dialogue and open channels of communication, all the stakeholders can strike a balance that will not hurt the pocket of Grab’s riders but will not leave Grab’s drivers empty-handed either…. ‘Yung tamang presyo at serbisyo na masaya ang lahat (The right price and service so everyone is happy),” she said. Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, for his part, said government regulators, such as the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), should probe the cost structure of ride-hailing services. “Dito papasok ang close monitoring ng LTFRB and PCC sa anti-competitive practices (This is where the LTFRB and the PCC’s close monitoring of anti-competitive practices comes in)…. They should also establish benchmarks that are internationally accepted to detect potential abuses of a monopoly,” Gatchalian said. He called on the LTFRB to require Grab to provide a breakdown of charges in its receipts for transparency. “Dapat i-review ng LTFRB ang lahat ng fees at charges na pinapatong sa commuters. At huwag payagan mag-charge ng mas mataas pa kaysa sa ibang bansa. I-mandato din ng LTFRB ang Grab na i-breakdown ang resibo at maging mas transparent pa sa mga singil sa commuters,” Gatchalian said.

But 11,000 more families – owners of lots inside the former battle area, based on TFBM data – are waiting to go back. (READ: A painful homecoming for Marawi evacuees) On Thursday, Del Rosario presented government plans for the former battle area in a big TFBM meeting in Iligan City.

Rappler: There are residents who are worried they will lose their land. Del Rosario: That [fear] is not valid. There is no basis for that. Walang lupang kukunin. Kung mayroon kang lupa, titled, that is yours.

But if you have titled property outside the roads, then that is yours. We will not touch it.   There are a lot of concerns. That is speculation.   What will happen to the former battle area? It will be developed. We will undertake horizontal as well as vertical rehabilitation. We are talking about widening the road nets so that when they return it will be better, and we will paying for the right of way for the expansion of the roads. For titled and non-titled properties occupied by residents, it will not be touched by the government.   There’s no reason to fear that from happening? The fear of government taking over their lands or titled property has no basis at all.   How about those who have problematic titles?  It should be resolved by the community themselves. By their allegation, they have been there since time immemorial. We will recognize it. As long as there is a peaceful environment, there is acceptance among the community that this Juan dela Cruz is the rightful owner, then so be it. We will be very compassionate, very understanding.     It is clear who own the lots inside battle area. There is no confusion. It’s one of the issues we need to address so that [when there are] different claimants in one particular lot, we can settle once and for all who is the rightful owners. We anticipate that there’ll be issues, and we are creating a land dispute arbitration committee. The subcommittee can specifically identify conflict areas or conflict titles. Will residents be allowed to reconstruct their homes? Yes, they will be the ones to reconstruct their homes. We will not be constructing them. We will only construct public facilities. Private facilities, private bulidings, commercial buildings, they’ll be the ones to construct it. We will only construct public facilities.   In the former battle area? Yes, in the MAA (most affected area).   There is confusion. It’s about time that you tell that.   There were pronouncements about the goverment building condominiums inside the former battle area.  It will be built on government land, where there would be renters or [where there are people] who would like to avail [of it]. If they do not like it, there is no problem.   How about families who want help to clear their lots of debris? We will clear it. Clearing alone would cost P2.5 billion, clearing all these debris.   How about the military camp? Will it displace residents? Actually it’s the private properties which have encroached into a military reservation. Let’s look at it that way. That is about 6,000 hectares military reservation, and 2,000 of the 6,000 are inside Marawi City. The military is now willing just to retain 50 hectares. All the rest can be given to legal claimants.     How about the new camp (not the existing 103rd Brigade headquarters)? The new camp is about 10 hectares only. The military is buying [from] legitimate owners. If they do not like to sell, we will not of course have it. But, in my understanding, the owners are willing to sell it.   How were residents consulted when the plans were made? Our consultation process is very, very exhaustive. So far I have conducted more than 50 consultations and, starting yesterday, our teams are conducting continous consultations until April 25.   Residents agree with the plans as presented? The teams are presenting to the different sectors, the clan owners, the barangay officials, the local government units, the academe, the youth. All sectors. They will engage and conduct a focus group discussion per sector.   What is the purpose of the continuing consultation?  It is for the rehabilitation of the MAA, so that we can identify already the specific locations as to where the conventions will be put up, the historical sites that will be maintained, the barangay hall, the health centres, the madrassahs that will be constructed. We would like to specify where these public facilities will be constructed.   You are very positive. What is the biggest challenge?   I don’t think there will be challenges that we cannot address because consultation is the key.

In a statement on Wednesday, April 11, Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said that the P2-per-minute charge was initiated “when Grab reviewed its pricing structure in June 2017,” and “was integrated to the existing per kilometer charges and is not added to the upfront fares.” “Per minute charges remain part and parcel [of] Grab’s fare structure today, and we have continuously been transparent about this truth,” Gonzales added. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), however, said the last fare schedule it had approved for Grab, in December 2016, was not in reference to any “time travel rate.”  A congressman says Grab therefore owes its riders a refund.  Why does Grab have to explain? Grab made the statement in response to the claim of PBA Representative Jericho Nograles that it was illegally charging its customers on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated transport network companies’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer travel. The order also put a cap on surge pricing to only twice as much as the normal fare. What does the law say? According to Commonwealth Act Number 146, fares that are “just and reasonable” are approved “only upon reasonable notice to the public services and other parties concerned, giving them a reasonable opportunity to be heard and the burden of the proof to show that the proposed rates or regulations are just and reasonable shall be upon the public service proposing the same.” It didn’t happen in Grab’s case. In an earlier interview with Rappler, the transport service network said no hearings were conducted prior to its implementing the charge of P2-per-minute in every ride. The LTFRB was only “made aware” of it, said Grab PH head Brian Cu.  On Wednesday, Gonzales said, “[W]e corresponded with the LTFRB to present these changes and was given the opportunity to present in full our business model, supply and demand models, and pricing structure during one of the Technical Working Group meetings in late July 2017.” In a statement, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said that the now-amended December 2016 order “was the last issued by board and still stands.” In that order, “there is no mention of time travel rate.” Should Grab’s accreditation be cancelled? According to Gonzales, the P2-per-minute charge was conceptualized to assure Grab drivers that they “would have a greater chance of making ends meet” despite heavy traffic congestion in the metro.  “At the end of the day, Grab seeks to always ensure a balance in fare to benefit both our passengers and drivers. We owe it to our riding public to remain truthful and transparent,” he said. But Nograles said that Grab owed its riders a refund. “They are liable for a refund. With Uber now being absorbed by Grab, we’re looking at the potential of 2.8 million rides per week and all of them charging P2 per minute. This is the problem when there is a monopoly,” he told Rappler in a phone interview on Tuesday, April 10. On Thursday, April 12, the LTFRB issued a show-cause order against Grab, asking them to explain why its transportation network company accreditation should not be suspended or cancelled over the allegations. By April 16, patrons of ride-hailing services will be left with only Grab as their choice, as LTFRB ordered Uber to close down. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/200034-ltfrb-grab-surge-pricing-lower-cap/","title":"LTFRB lowers Grab surge pricing cap amid illegal fare allegation","date":"Apr 11, 2018 4:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Effective immediately, the 1.5x surge pricing cap applies to all ride-hailing services offered by Grab","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Lower Grab fares during peak hours. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) gave this order on Wednesday, April 11, to Grab, telling the ride-hailing service to lower its surge pricing cap during peak hours from 2.0 to only 1.5 times the normal fare. Surge pricing was capped at twice the rates for time covered and distance traveled only, and not for the base fare. This amends LTFRB’s December 2016 order setting the fare structure of Grab.  The order is effective immediately. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said the board deemed it reasonable to lower Grab’s surge pricing cap since consumers are left with only Grab as their option for ride-hailing services, given the latter’s acquisition of Uber. “The board directs Grab to lower its surge from 2 to 1.5. Why? [The] LTFRB is processing the new TNC players. This is to ensure that the fares will be at a rate that is conducive and acceptable to the existing number of TNVS that are transferring to Grab,” Lizada said during a hearing on Wednesday. The cap applies to all ride-hailing services offered by Grab. Lizada said that the cap would be reviewed after new players have come in. Grab spokersperson Leo Gonzales said they understand the need for the cap to be lowered. “We understand their justification for this. This is a critical time. As soon as new players come in, the board will have to study again. But , of course, we will comply with further downgrading the cap from 2.0 to 1.5x,” Gonzales said. The order came after Grab acquired Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, leaving thousands of patrons with only one choice for ride-hailing services. (READ: LTFRB: Uber can only operate until April 15) The country’s competition watchdog ruled against the deal, arguing that it make for a “virtual monopoly.” Meanwhile, Grab is also in hot waters as PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused Grab of illegally charging its customers of P2 per minute for their rides. This is on top of its flagdown rate of P40 and charging P10 to P14 per kilometer, which was allowed by the board.

Grab officials say the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board was informed about this.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – A lawmaker on Tuesday, April 10, accused Grab Philippines of “illegally” charging its consumers and said the ride-hailing service should refund its customers P1.8 billion for the last 5 months alone. In an interview with CNN Philippines, PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused Grab of illegally charging P2 per minute for their rides, on top of its flagdown rate of P40 and charging P10 to P14 per kilometer. “Grab charges P2 per minute illegally. They’re not allowed to charge P2 per minute. The LTFRB has not allowed them to charge P2 per minute but they have charged P2 per minute to everyone,” Nograles said. The lawmaker said that based on his calculation, the illegal charges of Grab amounted to P1.8 billion. “I have calculated that in the past 5 months, they owe P1.8 billion to the riding public,” Nograles said. Nograles told Rappler in a phone interview on Tuesday that he arrived at the figure based on the conservative estimate of P1.5 million Grab rides per week, multiplied by the average travel duration of 30 minutes, at a P2-per-minute charge, over 5 months. He said he set his calculation for that period because he only had personal knowledge about the alleged illegal charge 5 months ago.  When Grab Philippines launched its ride-hailing services in 2015, it charged a base fare of P30 and additional P12 per kilometer. There was supposed to be no additional charges per minute. In December 2016, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered a cap on ride-hailing services fares, with Grab maintaining its base fare of P30 and lowering its per kilometer charging to a P10 to P14 range depending on surge pricing. Nograles said that as of 2017, the P2-per-minute charge was “not approved” by the LTFRB. The lawmaker said that when he asked the LTFRB about the pricing, he was told: “Really? Maybe you should talk to Grab.” “Alam ba ‘yan ng LTFRB o hindi? Kung hindi nila alam, complacency ‘yan. If alam nila, graft ‘yan (Does the LTFRB know about this? If they don’t, then that’s complacency. If they do, it’s graft),” Nograles added. Rappler sought a comment from LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada on Nograles’ allegation, but she has not yet replied as of posting. Grab repeatedly said in the past that fares will remain as is as it “cannot unilaterally” increase the fares.  Although fares right now may not increase given its acquisition of Uber, Grab Philippines earlier submitted a petition before the LTFRB to increase fares due to the tax reform law. What does LTFRB know? Does LTFRB know about the P2-per-minute charge? LTFRB and Grab have different answers. As far as LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra knows, “Grab doesn’t charge per travel time.” Delgra said this in an interview on radio dzRh on Sunday, April 8, when asked about the difference in the fares charged by Grab and Uber.  “Medyo mataas ‘yung Grab kasi nag-o-offer yung Uber ng, aside from the base fare na parehas sila P40 each, ‘yung per [kilometer] nila mas mababa ‘yung Uber eh, P5.70 per [kilometer] . Pero ‘yung Grab P11 to P14 per [kilometer], pero wala sila ‘yung travel time. ‘Yung Uber naman meron sila travel time, P2 per minute,” he said on Sunday.  (Grab fares are more expensive than Uber because aside from having the same base fare of P40 each, Uber’s per kilometer charge is cheaper than Grab at P5.70 per kilometer. Grab charges P11 to P14 per kilometer but they don’t have travel time [charges]. Meanwhile, Uber charges travel time at P2 per minute.) Asked about its P2-per-minute charge, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu told Rappler in an interview on Monday, April 9, “LTFRB is aware.” Grab spokesman Leo Gonzales, who was with Cu during the brief Rappler interview, said, “There was a time that we informed LTFRB about this.” Asked whether the LTFRB held a hearing on the additional charge, Cu said, “No hearing because at that time, it (fare) wasn’t regulated yet at the start.” “The first TNC accreditation doesn’t say that pricing will be regulated. It’s already in the new ones,” he added. Uber announced on March 26 that it sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business.

Grab Philippines also said operations of the two ride-hailing companies can no longer be separate, as required by PCC for the duration of its review of the deal, as they are currently funding the operations of Uber since the acquisition.

Cu explained that after the acquisition, Grab was funding the current operations of Uber, thus, operations cannot be totally independent. “Considering that Uber has exited the region on March 25 and clearly stated during the public hearing its incapacity to fund the operations in the Philippines, the parties have agreed to keep the Uber app operational with Grab bearing the costs, to give drivers and consumers time to adjust to Uber’s departure,” Cu said. Grab has been shouldering the cost of the Uber app extension from March 25 to its earlier scheduled shutdown on April 8, the original period of transition.  Cu added that the Uber app shutdown will be moved to midnight of April 15, which means extra costs for Grab.  The country head of Grab reiterated that the Uber app can still be accessed but “it has limited functionality and little or no support.” The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said it was concerned that there would be a deluge of customer complaints. “The current solution does not benefit the riding public. It’s a risk for the riding public. If a road crash happens, who has the accountability?” he said in a mix of English and Filipino. Cu called on the PCC to discuss the matter with them further, as keeping the Uber app functioning indefinitely will cost them “expensively.” Uber and Grab face a P50,000- to P2-million penalty per violation for failure or refusal to comply with the PCC’s order. However, both companies will be given a chance to explain their sides before this order will be implemented.  Many Uber patrons slammed the deal between the two companies, arguing that Grab has “monopolized” the ride-hailing service until the LTFRB approves 4 new ride-hailing apps. But Cu said that fares will remain as is, as they “cannot unilaterally” increase the fares. Although fares right now may not increase given the acquisition, Grab Philippines earlier submitted a petition to increase fares due to the tax reform law.– Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/199744-pcc-interim-measures-uber-grab-merger-review/","title":"PCC releases interim measures pending review of Grab-Uber deal","date":"Apr 7, 2018 2:54 PM PHT","snippet":"'This virtual monopolization of the market by Grab can harm the riding public,' says Philippine Competition Commission Chairman Arsenio Balisacan, as the country's antitrust body conducts an in-depth review of the deal","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) on Saturday, April 7, released interim measures that seek to protect the riding public and drivers of Grab and Uber as the country’s antitrust watchdog reviews the deal of the ride-sharing services.

PCC Commissioner Stella Luz Quimbo had announced the forthcoming release of the interim measures during a public hearing on the deal on Thursday, April 5, when it was first announced that the PCC had asked Uber and Grab to continue using their own platforms beyond Sunday, April 8. (READ: PCC asks Uber, Grab to continue separate operations beyond April 8) The PCC order, dated April 6, effectively stops Grab’s acquisition of its competitor temporarily until the PCC completes its “in-depth review” of the local implications of the sale of Uber’s Southeast Asian business to Grab.  Measures Under the interim measures, aside from maintaining the independence of their respective operations and other conditions that prevailed prior to the deal on March 25, Uber and Grab were also directed to “refrain from providing access to or from allowing a party to obtain from the other party any confidential information, including but not limited to information pertaining to pricing, formulas, incentives, operations, marketing and sales policies, promotions, partner drivers, and customers.” The National Privacy Commission (NPC) earlier expressed concern about privacy issues that may arise from the deal, saying personal data privacy should be respected and protected in the process. (READ: No migration of personal data to Grab in Uber app shutdown – privacy commission) The PCC also ordered the ride-hailing services to: Uber and Grab face a P50,000- to P2-million penalty per violation for failure or refusal to comply with the PCC’s order, but this will not be immediately executory as they will be given a chance to explain their side. Compliance report Referring to the continued independent operations after April 8, the PCC said in its order, “Should the Respondents failed to comply with item (a) above within five (5) working days from service of this Order, Respondents shall show cause within twenty-four (24) hours from the end of the aforementioned five (5) day period as to why they should not be held in contempt and subjected to penalties.” The PCC also ordered Uber and Grab to submit periodic verified compliance reports with supporting documents, the first within 15 days from the service of the order, and evern 20 days after. The PCC is mandated to protect competition in the market and prohibit anticompetitive conduct, including mergers and acquisitions of businesses and companies that may substantially prevent, restrict, or lessen competition. Virtual monopolization In a statement, PCC chairman Arsenio Balisacan said the looming monopoly may have consequences for Filipinos who avail of the ride-sharing services.   “This move by Uber in the Philippine market leads to further substantial concentration of what is, to begin with, an already highly concentrated ride-sharing market. This virtual monopolization of the market by Grab can harm the riding public,” he said.  “The PCC believes that Uber is capable of operating its ride-hailing app in the country, despite its claims that it has already exited the Southeast Asia market,” he added. The PCC chief cited the case of Uber operations in Singapore. “Uber’s compliance with our antitrust counterpart in Singapore to extend the operation of its app indicates the feasibility of continuing its operations in the Philippines as well,” he said.  Balisacan also said that Uber does not highlight the fact that it would become a “part-owner” of Grab through the deal. “Uber is highlighting its exit, but what it does not emphasize enough is its integration with Grab. Thus, Uber is not truly exiting the Philippine market, but rather effectively merging their operations with Grab here. The deal makes Uber a part-owner of Grab,” he said.   Uber announced on March 26 that it sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business.

The sale announced on Monday, March 26, ended a bruising battle between the ride-hailing behemoths and marked the US firm’s latest retreat from international markets. But the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) said both companies would face interim measures as it probes concerns Grab will have a virtual monopoly on the ride-hailing market – the first time such a directive has been issued in the city-state. Under rules which take effect immediately, the companies will not be allowed to integrate their operations until the CCS investigation is finished. They will have to maintain separate pricing and cannot obtain confidential information from each other like costing or customer and driver details. This is likely to prove a major stumbling block for the deal, under which Singapore-based Grab is set to take over Uber’s ride-sharing and food delivery operations in the region. In return Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business, with chief executive of the California-headquartered company Dara Khosrowshahi joining the Grab board. Singapore has a voluntary merger notification regime and the Commission said it has not received submissions from Uber and Grab as of Friday. Both companies have indicated they intend to file a formal merger notification, the CCS said.

This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters.","body":" In a drastic yet unsurprising move, Uber has finally ceded its Southeast Asia operations to Grab. This means that Uber will have a 27.5% stake in Grab, Uber’s CEO will join Grab’s board, Uber staff and drivers will be absorbed by Grab, and Uber’s app will no longer work in our phones. Above all, this merger makes Grab the ride-hailing monopoly in most of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. Why did Uber have to leave the region? What does this mean for Filipino commuters? And what can government do? Uber’s exit The emails blasted by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi to his global staff explain a lot about Uber’s exit. He said, “One of the potential dangers of our global strategy is that we take on too many battles across too many fronts and with too many competitors.” Uber is known to pick its battles. In 2016, it yielded its China operations to local player Didi Chuxing for a 17.7% stake in that firm. Early this year, Uber also gave way to Russia’s Yandex for a 37% stake. In all instances, Uber’s strategy is the same: cede market share in exchange for stakes in the local competitor. But Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia may yet be its biggest move. What brought this on? First, Grab has catered to the transport needs of Southeast Asians in ways Uber did not. Grab, for example, introduced such customized services as GrabBike (an alternative to motorcycle-taxis like those in Viet Nam), GrabHitch (now a favorite way to cross the Malaysia-Singapore border), and even Grab Yee Sang (where Grab delivers a specific dish called yee sang during the Chinese New Year rush). Second, aside from a better understanding of Asian sensibilities, Grab has also carefully avoided needless regulatory entanglements throughout the region. Whereas Uber often found itself clashing with regulators – including our own LTFRB [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board] – Grab has adopted a softer, more “cooperative” approach. Finally, Uber’s exit can also be seen as a way to improve its finances – that is, reduce losses in unprofitable markets – ahead of its planned IPO (initial public offering) in 2019. In this, tremendous pressure to consolidate likely came from Uber and Grab’s common investor, Japan-based SoftBank Group Corp, which now owns large stakes in both ride-hailing companies. All in all, Uber’s Southeast Asia exit was part and parcel of a global corporate strategy. Grab’s monopoly But with Uber out of the way, Grab now enjoys monopoly status in many Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines. This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters. First, Grab’s monopoly status leaves commuters with no other viable choice. New ride-hailing services – like Lag Go, Hype, Owto, Hirna, and MiCab – are reportedly seeking accreditation from the LTFRB. But can these start-ups fill the void left by Uber and provide similar services? MiCab, for example, which first operated in Cebu and Iloilo, turns out to be just a taxi-hailing app with none of Uber’s innovations like dynamic pricing. More importantly, can these new services grow sufficiently large to chip away at the gargantuan market share now enjoyed by Grab? Although the market is “contestable”, Grab faces no real competition right now. One exception could be Go-Jek, which has managed to keep Grab at bay in Indonesia. Go-Jek is reportedly expanding in Southeast Asia by the middle of 2018, but will it come to the Philippines too? Second, Uber’s exit spells higher ride fares, fewer promos, or both. Most commuters observe that, on average, Grab rides tend to be pricier than Uber rides. But this actually stems from Uber’s “cross-subsidization” strategy: because of its global reach, Uber can use revenues from profitable markets to partially shoulder fares in unprofitable markets. Grab – having no such deep war chest to draw from – competes instead with the aggressive use of promos, discounts, and vouchers. But now, with substantial market power, Grab can easily dispense with such promos. They might even be tempted to raise fares. China provides a valuable case study: a year after Uber yielded its market share to Didi Chuxing, getting rides there has reportedly become “harder and more expensive than ever before.” Third, some riders will miss beloved features of the Uber app, including a more seamless design and drivers’ inability to see passengers’ destinations by default. The latter is especially useful in preventing drivers from routinely refusing passengers. Unless Grab adopts some of Uber’s finer features like these, the consumer experience will likely be no better. Government’s regulation Excessive market power is a sign of a “market failure” that can justify government intervention. But how exactly can the Duterte government respond to the Uber-Grab merger? First, the PCC [Philippine Competition Commission] – tasked by law look into any and all anti-competitive acts – can, in fact, block or nullify the Uber-Grab deal. The PCC might also prevent higher fares resulting from the merger. The Malaysian government, for instance, has already warned Grab that it will take legal action against any such price hikes. Second, the National Privacy Commission (NPC) will have to ensure that the migration of users and drivers’ data from Uber to Grab won’t compromise their privacy. Third, the LTFRB must help to promote competition in ride-hailing. But, at the same time, can it resist the temptation to overregulate? To wit, the LTFRB gave both Uber and Grab such a rough time last year. Not only did the LTFRB suspend new franchise applications, it also made a show of “losing” Uber and Grab’s accreditation papers in their offices. The LTFRB also suspended Uber for a month and demanded from it a hefty (and rather arbitrary) fine of P190 million. Worse, some lawmakers are also thinking to require congressional franchises before any and all ride-hailing firms could operate in the country. No one questions the need to regulate ride-hailing. Quotas, for example, might reduce their contribution to road congestion. But there’s a fine line between regulation and overregulation that the LTFRB hasn’t quite mastered just yet. The LTFRB also needs to avoid the use of double standards: last year, when it suspended Uber for a month, the LTFRB supported policies to increase the ridership of regular taxis. This included express support for the use of taxi-hailing app MiCab in Metro Manila, as well as proposals to grant more taxi franchises. If congestion were really the problem, why introduce more taxis at the time Uber was gone? Without sufficient study and justification, such policies only reek of opportunism and regulatory capture. Commuting just got worse Uber and Grab, left to themselves, have failed the riding public. The government needs to step in to increase commuters’ choices, prevent higher fares, and improve the quality of their services. But is government up to the challenge? Three agencies are worth watching here: the PCC, the National Privacy Commission, and the LTFRB. Can the first take binding legal action against Uber and Grab if the deal proves anti-competitive? Can the second protect commuters and drivers’ data from being compromised? Can the third promote the entry of new players while avoiding the urge to overregulate? At a time of choking traffic jams, frequent MRT breakdowns, massive transport strikes, and high gas prices, the last thing we need now is a monopoly in ride-hailing.

In a press briefing on Wednesday, March 28, Grab Philippines Head Brian Cu said that they have started the so-called onboarding process of Uber drivers since Monday, March 26. However, because of the sheer volume of ex-Uber drivers transitioning, Cu said they would have to extend beyond the April 8 shutdown. “We’ve been processing endlessly, tirelessly since yesterday all ‘Uberkads’ (Uber partners) who come here and we will continue doing this all the way up to, even after the Uber app is turned off because I’m not sure everyone can be here before April 8,” Cu said in a mix of English and Filipino.

Meanwhile, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada assured the commuting public  that fares will not be raised with Grab’s acquisition of Uber. “Grab cannot increase its fare on its own. We know their range. We monitor them. Any request for fare hike goes through a hearing, where commuter side is heard, where NEDA (National Economic Development Authority) helps us. Grab knows how serious we are with violations as we fined Uber before,” Lizada said on Wednesday. Cu added that the increase in Grab’s available drivers will also mean demand will be met better. “With the increased supply base, it’s easier to allocate, meaning surge will not be as frequent as it used to be,” he said. Although fares right now may not increase given the merger, Grab Philippines and Uber earlier submitted petitions to increase fares due to the tax reform law. The hearing is set on April 3. Only option Lizada also said that Grab will not monopolize the transport network vehicle services industry. She said that other potential transport network companies have submitted applications to the LTFRB before but they are just waiting for them to complete their documents. “If you say that there is no competition, soon there will be. Owto, Lag go, and Hype had applied to be TNCs,” she said. Once all requirements have been submitted, Lizada said the regulatory board will deliberate if they will be accepted. Confusing Many Uber drivers were confused by the situation.   At Grab’s onboarding site in Quezon City, Ruggo Rivero and Olga Diaz said they only found out that the Uber app will shut down on Monday.  “It was very confusing for us. We only knew about it two days ago. As partners, we would have appreciated if we knew about this earlier given that Uber has not been meeting its target profits,” Rivero said in a mix of English and Filipino. With limited time in their hands, Rivero said he had to give up a day of driving just to finally process his papers. “I could’ve driven now as surge pricing is higher but here I am now.” However, Rivero sees a light at the end of the tunnel with better income coming from his driving. “Well, I guess I’ll be earning more with Grab than with Uber. Olga earns more than I do [when she drives for Grab]. But at the end of the day, for us it’s all about service,” he said.

Uber users and drivers will be required to register anew with Grab to allow them to use the Grab TNV platform,” Nabua said. No impact on data breach probe The NPC on Tuesday said Uber’s merger with Grab would not affect the agency’s ongoing probe into a data breach in 2017, which exposed information on drivers and users of Uber. “This sale does not affect our ongoing investigation into past Uber breaches that involved Filipino users,” Liboro said. “This investigation is continuing and a report would be out soon,” he added.

Part 1: Notes of caution on Duterte’s preferred constitutional overhaul Is a no-election scenario possible in May 2019?  This no-el scenario comes from the House of Representatives itself. It is the foundation of House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) Number 9, which was passed last January 16. It is in the report of subcommittee 1 of the committee on constitutional amendments that the no-election scenario of May 2019 is assumed.    On the other hand, the direct declaration that there will be no election for May 2019 comes mainly from public pronouncements by members of the Lower House led by Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez. The initial game plan is to have a new federal constitution approved during the barangay elections in May 2018. However, this timetable expired even before it started because the Senate did not want to cha-cha if Congress, convened as a constituent assembly, is to vote jointly and not separately.  What are the implications of a no-election scenario in May 2019? There are many, but I list only two of the most important. First, this power grab is damaging to democracy since Filipino voters will be deprived for one legislative term their fundamental democratic right to vote their representatives in the legislative branch, voting being the most important political exercise that helps qualify a political system as minimally democratic. Legislators, on the other hand, will undermine their electoral mandate from the public as they are going to occupy office beyond the terms they were voted for. Both the mandate-deprived Lower House and the Senate will also find their institutions even weaker than they are now vis-à-vis the already powerful Philippine president, who enjoys a robust electoral mandate that is still good for the next half of his term.  Second, it is injurious to the charter change campaign itself, because it would be exposed as primarily a power grab of self-interested, shameless, and power-hungry legislators, who exploit charter change both as a smokescreen and as an excuse to extend themselves in power.   Changing rules to allow re-election Suspending elections involves a shameless power grab of changing the rules to avoid elections. However, the question, “If we were to change the Constitution, would incumbent elective officials who have otherwise reached their term limits be allowed to run in the next elections as if they were running for their first terms?” involves a more sophisticated power grab of changing the rules to allow for re-election.   Suspension of elections is about a garapal (brazen) power grab; changing the rules to allow for re-election is a more suwabe (sleek) power grab. But this latter power grab can be more dangerous than the former. This is because, come year 2022, this question will involve the incumbent president himself.  On this re-election question, not only the report of the committee on constitutional amendments of HCR 9 gets implicated but also the proposed federal constitutions of representatives Eugene de Vera and Aurelio Gonzales Jr (Resolution of Both Houses Number 8) and of the PDP-Laban. Because they introduce a new constitution without a provision banning the incumbent president, they must all answer the question whether their new constitution allows the incumbent president of the old constitution – who is barred from running again under the old constitution – to run under the new constitution.  One of the Senate’s resource persons in a previous hearing complained that critics keep on seeing “monsters when there are none,” arguing that there is no term extension for the current president in the PDP-Laban constitution. What he fails to see is the monster he is riding on. Anytime a new constitution is introduced in a presidential democracy with existing term limits, the question of term extension of the incumbent president becomes a central concern.  This is not based on the “fear of the new” but on knowledge of previous constitutional episodes involving elected strongmen who tried to skirt terms limits of their democracies by coming up with a new constitution. Alberto Fujimori did it in Peru in 1993 with his new constitution that ended the single-term limit for president of the 1979 Constitution. Hugo Chavez did it in Venezuela in 1999 with his new constitution that ended the 10-year waiting period for a president to run again under the 1961 Constitution. Ferdinand Marcos tried to do it in 1971-1972 to override the 8-consecutive-year term limit rule of the 1935 Constitution through a constitutional convention to write a new constitution. But Marcos failed, forcing him to fall back on plan B, which was to declare martial law and terminate Philippine democracy altogether. Changing constitutions is a classic strategy of autocratic leaders elected in democracies but who later undermined their own democracies.  This concern on presidential re-election becomes even more serious because the institutional design of the transitory provisions of both HCR no. 9 and RBH no. 8 gives the incumbent president mind-boggling powers, such that the president becomes a one-man hyper executive-legislative package. The powers of the president are almost revolutionary.  For example, the report of subcommittee 1 of the committee on constitutional amendments of HCR 9 says: “The incumbent President shall exercise all the powers and functions of the head of state and head of government under this Federal Constitution until the election of the next President and Prime Minister in May 2022. He shall appoint the new Cabinet from among the Members of Parliament. He shall have supervision and direction over the interim Prime Minister and Cabinet.”  With all these immense powers, and since the new constitution does not bar him to run, he would therefore be in a perfect position to run in 2022, giving him an unbelievable head start over any opposition in the next presidential elections.  Hence, on this issue, the institutional challenge to protect your democracy is to ban the incumbent president – who is covered by the constitutional ban on re-election under the 1987 Constitution – from running as president under the new proposed federal constitutions. Since federalism is being sold by most Filipino proponents as supposedly fulfilling the need for sweeping institutional changes to improve our democracy, I challenge all the proponents of federalism from the PDP-Laban to members of the House of Representatives and of the consultative committee formed by President Duterte to put their institutional design where their mouth is: write down a provision banning the incumbent president to allay the valid fears of many Filipinos that this shift to federalism is part of the same script of the current president and his key allies to remain in power beyond his constitutionally mandated term limit under the 1987 Constitution.  The statement of President Duterte that he will step down in 2022 even if a federal constitution is passed is as good as his campaign promise to ride a jet ski to the Spratlys, a promise which he now teases his own supporters for believing. To make sure that in 2022 he does not tease the country for believing him in 2018 that he will step down once his term ends under the 1987 Constitution and not run again for president, institutionalize his promise to step down by constitutionally barring him to run in your proposed federal constitutions.

I can count only one terrible experience but the response was über quick,” she said in a Facebook post. Pipay Gonzales, a 26-year-old public relations manager in Makati City, said she was dismayed. “Those who use ride-hailing apps, like Uber and Grab, will be the losers in this deal. Commuters like me won’t be able to compare prices now. We won’t know if we are being priced unfairly. The government should do something about it,” she told Rappler in an interview. Del Monte and Gonzales are just a couple of the ride-hailing app users in the Philippines who have expressed disappointment over the Uber-Grab deal. In the Philippines, 3 companies – Uber, Grab, and U-Hop – are accredited to operate as transport network companies. But with the deal, the local competition will just be between Grab and U-Hop. Up for review? Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said in a statement that no notification has been filed at the agency by Grab or Uber to date. “If the parties meet the new threshold, they should notify the PCC within 30 days after signing of their definitive agreement,” Balisacan said. Early this month, the PCC doubled the threshold for reviewing merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the country. The PCC on March 5 published a memorandum, raising the thresholds to P5 billion for the value of assets or revenues of the parent entity, and P2 billion for the size of the transaction as defined in the implementing rules and regulations.  “If the transaction meets the new [thresholds], the parties do have to notify us and we have to review the transaction,” PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said, echoing Balisacan’s statement. Fare structure regulation For its part, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it will continue to regulate and monitor the fare structure for the benefit of the riding public. A hearing is set for April 3 to tackle the proposed fare hike of Uber and Grab. “As [for] trust issues, we have [the] PCC whose mandate is to check the same. We will be awaiting [the] manifestation to be filed by Uber to address the issues pending before the LTFRB,” the transport regulator said in a statement. Grab earlier said a “dynamic surcharge” would continue to be applied based on several factors, including demand and supply at that particular point in time, traffic conditions, and estimated time for the journey. Customers who pick the taxi option, meanwhile, will continue to pay metered fares. With Uber moving out of the picture, the LTFRB said it would welcome new transport network companies as long as these are accredited. “With the new guidelines right now, any new TNC is welcome as long as they are accredited by the LTFRB and they pass the necessary documents for their respective accounts,” the agency said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/198978-uber-philippines-southeast-asia-drivers-grab-migration/","title":"Uber drivers in Southeast Asia moving to Grab in 2 weeks","date":"Mar 26, 2018 1:55 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Uber's operations in Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, will only be available until April 8, following the sale to Grab","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – In two weeks’ time, all drivers of Uber in the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia will have to move to Grab, after the California-based company sold its Southeast Asian business to its Singaporean rival.

The Uber app will continue to operate for two weeks to ensure stability for Uber drivers,” Grab said in a statement on Monday, March 26. “We’re working hard to onboard Uber drivers onto the Grab platform. We appreciate your patience during this transition timeframe if there may be any service disruptions,” the ride-hailing firm added later on its website. In the immediate term, Grab noted that “nothing will change and operations will continue as normal.” Current Uber users’ account information, however, will not be shared with Grab. “If you are new to Grab, we will still need you to register your account with us to start riding,” Grab said. The firm added that fares would remain the same, with a dynamic surcharge applied based on several factors, including demand and supply at that particular point in time, traffic conditions, and estimated time for the journey. Customers who pick the taxi option, meanwhile, will continue to pay metered fares. As for firms that use Uber as company transportation, Grab said: “Uber for Business services for employees of local and global companies will not be supported for trips taken in Southeast Asia after the transition. Uber rides outside of Southeast Asia will still be supported through existing Uber for Business agreements.” Grab had announced on Monday that it is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region.

The Philippine government has since suspended the processing of TNVS applications twice, after issues on the scope of regulation as well as complaints from taxi operators who argued there was “unequal application” of rules. It was just on February 5 this year when the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) again opened TNVS franchise applications.

Singapore-based Grab is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region, with the California-based company to receive a 27.5% stake in the business in return. The sale is Uber’s latest withdrawal from a market where it had faced fierce competition, as new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi seeks to stem huge losses and move past a series of scandals. After a fierce battle, Uber sold its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in 2016 in return for a stake, and last year the US firm merged in Russia with the taxi-hailing app of internet giant Yandex. The deal with Grab is similar to the one struck with Didi, and ends a years-long fight for market share in a region that is home to some 650 million people and an increasingly affluent middle class. “Today’s acquisition marks the beginning of a new era,” said Grab chief executive Anthony Tan. “The combined business is the leader in platform and cost efficiency in the region.” Khosrowshahi, who is joining Grab’s board as part of the deal, said: “This deal is a testament to Uber’s exceptional growth across Southeast Asia over the last five years. It will help us double down on our plans for growth.” Push for consolidation Grab has long been the dominant force in ride-hailing in Southeast Asia and speculation mounted that a deal with Uber was on the cards after Japanese financial titan Softbank invested huge sums in the US firm. Softbank is also a major investor in Grab, and is known for pushing for consolidation in the global ride-hailing industry, which has been losing billions of dollars a year due to turf wars. Grab, launched in 2012, has poured money into expanding its regional fleet and now has more than 2.1 million drivers in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Competition between ride-hailing apps has been heating up in Southeast Asia, with the market forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025, according to a 2016 report by Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek. Uber is the largest firm of its kind with a presence in more than 600 cities, but it has been rocked by scandals and is facing fierce competition from rivals in Asia and Europe. Chief executive Travis Kalanick was ousted in June last year after missteps including allegations of executive misconduct, a toxic workplace atmosphere and potentially unethical competitive practices. New boss Khosrowshahi has vowed to turn the company around as Uber gears up for 2019 public share offering. But he has a fight on his hands – Uber’s losses in 2017 grew to $4.5 billion from the $2.8 billion the company lost a year earlier. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/198473-dela-rosa-grab-drivers-join-war-riding-tandem-shooters/","title":"PNP taps Grab drivers in war vs riding-in-tandem shooters","date":"Mar 19, 2018 9:42 AM PHT","snippet":"The move comes as the PNP wages a war against riding-in-tandem shooters","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa urged Grab drivers on Monday, March 19 to hop on to their war against riding-in-tandem shooters. The call was made during the oath taking ceremony of 500 Grab drivers as road safety marshalls to help with the PNP Highway Patrol Group (HPG). “Bantayan ninyo ‘yan (riding-in-tandem shooters)…1,000 eyes and ears, makalusot pa kaya ang riding-in-tandem diyan?” (Look out for them. With 1,000 eyes and ears, would there still be riding-in-tandem incidents?) Why urge them? The PNP has an ongoing war against motorcycle-riding shooters after they noted a rise in homicides and murders during the first two years under President Rodrigo Duterte.   The push for the campaign was intensified in September 2017 after police were taken out from the administration’s war on drugs. It is unclear how the PNP has followed through with the project ever since their return to the anti-narcotics campaign.  How can they help? As road safety marshalls, the 500 Grab drivers are expected to report any irregularity they see while plying Metro Manila roads. These irregularities include road obstructions and unruly drivers along major roads, and shootings committed by motorcycle-riding suspects in narrow streets. The Grab drivers just simply text a special hotline set up by the PNP HPG, and cops will respond. Abuse of power possible: According to PNP HPG director Chief Superintendent Arnel Escobal, Grab drivers cannot use the title of road safety marshall to defend themselves from apprehension. He added text reports by Grab drivers will be validated by HPG cops before they pursue an apprehension. Asked how they will check reports, Escobal just said cops are already trained to decide for themselves. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/197773-thewrap-march-9-2018-midday-edition/","title":"Trump to meet Kim, Alejano on frigates deal, Uber and Grab | Midday wRap","date":"Mar 9, 2018 12:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the midday newscast with Marguerite de Leon","body":"Today on Rappler: United States President Donald Trump agree to a historic first meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un by the end of May. Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano calls out Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and Navy chief Robert Empedrad for their ‘change of tune’ during a House probe into the controversial frigates project. Uber is selling parts of its Southeast Asia operations to local rival Grab.

The application started at 8 am, with the first applicant completing the entire process within 10 minutes. Juliet Bulaon, a Grab partner, lined up as early as 6:30 am to make sure she would finish first. “It’s a relief. Now that [we have the papers needed], I won’t be worrying about our [car getting apprehended] all the time,” she said in Filipino on Monday. Bulaon is among the 66,750 operators who are expected to apply for their Provisional Authority (PA) as a step to eventually getting their Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) franchise. After 10 working days, Bulaon will return to the LTFRB for a hearing that will determine whether she will be granted a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC). If that is granted, she will get a franchise that will last for two years. Grab Philippines head Brian Cu echoed Bulaon’s sentiments, saying many TNVS drivers worry about getting apprehended by traffic enforcers for being “colorum.” “They can now drive without worrying that they will be apprehended for the reasons that they are colorum vehicles – they are not,” Cu said. Smooth process LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada described the process on Monday as “very smooth.” They were able to process about 50 applications within the first hour. “The applicants have complete documents with them that’s why the flow is smooth. There are some minor setbacks (with incomplete documents), but it’s manageable,” Lizada told reporters on Monday. Based on initial talks, LTFRB is set to process 300 applications per day – with Grab and Uber alloted 150 slots each. (READ: LTFRB to accept franchise applications for lease-to-own cars but…) But Lizada said they were able to finish all 300 applications before 2 pm, so the regulatory board will increase the number of applications they can accommodate in succeeding days. Transport Network Companies (TNC) Grab and Uber have set up assistance centers near LTFRB to ensure that applicants have all the requirements needed. Easier booking As the LTFRB opened up franchise applications, the TNCs think that booking for services will now be easier. Yves Gonzalez, Uber Philippines’ public policy head, said more drivers would be encouraged to get on the road now that are holding the proper documents. Grab’s Cu also said that that booking will be smoother, as issuing franchises is one way to determine whether the supply of TNVS vehicles will meet the demand on the road. “This is the step to get the right number of vehicles. We will see whether the supply will meet the demand. LTFRB will assess in the next months whether there’s a need to increase the numbers,” Cu said. In 2016, LTFRB suspended accepting new applications for TNVS permits for ride-hailing apps due to the rising volume of applications and concern of oversupply of units. Earlier in February, the regulatory board set the cap at 66,750 units, but said it would review the figure if the demand for TNVS is not met. (READ: Poe to LTFRB: ‘Explain the math’ behind cap on ride-hailing vehicles)– Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/197265-grab-launch-service-clark-international-airport/","title":"LOOK: Grab PH launches services from Clark International Airport","date":"Mar 2, 2018 5:14 PM PHT","snippet":"Nearly 400 units will be available to provide ride-hailing services for passengers from the country's second main gateway","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Passengers can now book Grab rides from the Clark International Airport.

In a press conference, One Goal 1 Voice TNVS community said the LTFRB does not give current and active drivers who do not have provisional authority (PA) assurances that they will be accredited. The application for TNVS permits opens on Monday, February 5, and it will be done on a “first come, first served” basis. The TNVS community is concerned that new operators would submit applications and “hog” the available slots. LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III earlier said some 32,000 slots are open to fill the “common supply base,” which was recently set at 45,700 units. Currently, there are around 125,000 units registered under Grab Philippines and Uber Philippines, exceeding the cap twice over. When asked whether current and active drivers would not be prioritized, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said “that seems to be what is happening.” Cu said they are hoping the LTFRB will consider using the transport network companies’ master list of active drivers and prioritize them during the application period. “What we’re proposing, and hopefully that gets settled, is that they (the LTFRB) use the submitted master list as basis of who’s active… I don’t want to log jam the applications that are not complete or are not active and I think a lot of people will agree to that,” Cu said. He also urged the LTFRB to review the cap, suggesting ways on how to arrive at better numbers. Given the total registered number, Cu said there are probably around 90,000 unique units or some 40% less the total registered vehicles. “You subtract those who are not active. I think that’s about 75,000 active unique drivers in total,” he added in a mix of English and Filipino. “Provided with all the numbers, ilan ang active daily? Medyo nagulat kami sa’n nanggaling ‘yung number na ‘yun (How many are active daily? We were surprised where that number came from),” Cu said, referring to the 45,700-unit cap. Review the cap On Monday, January 29, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said he has already ordered the LTFRB to review Memorandum Circular (MC) 2018-003 which limits the common supply base of TNVS. Tugade said policies “should be anchored in the spirit of good governance and compassion, in order to better serve the interest of all the stakeholders.” In a statement, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) said it will monitor the number of booking requests received by ride-hailing apps, including the served and unserved requests. The DOTr will also take into acount number coding, maintenance schedules, and drivers’ working hours. “We assure you that should there be adjustments in the common supply base as a result of the review, the decision would be based on actual data from the different transport network companies, thorough DOTr study, and consultations with the public at large,” the department said. Senator Grace Poe, chairperson of the Senate committee on public services, earlier asked the LTFRB to “explain the math” behind the common supply base crafted by the regulatory board. The memorandum is the latest move by the LTFRB in its attempt to regulate ride-hailing apps Grab, Uber, and U-Hop. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/194504-uber-philippines-tax-reform-fare-hike/","title":"Uber Philippines seeks fare hike, citing tax reform law","date":"Jan 25, 2018 3:15 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) From the current P5.70 fare per kilometer for UberX, the ride-hailing service firm proposes to increase it to P9 to P12, depending on the time of the day","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Uber Philippines on Thursday, January 25, submitted a petition to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for a fare hike due to increasing fuel prices and new excise taxes on petroleum.

TeamSpeed said the LTFRB had repeatedly given assurances that they would not put a cap on the number of transport network vehicle service (TNVS) cars in the country. The LTFRB supposedly only changed its mind recently. “Nu’ng nasa Senate hearing kami, ang sabi ay walang cap, then all of [a] sudden, [in the] past technical working groups bigla na lang nagbago in a snap (When we were at the Senate, they said they would not put a cap, then all of a sudden, in the past technical working groups they changed their mind in a snap),” the group said. TeamSpeed will appeal the decision of the board, and will demand the data or the rationale behind limiting the number of TNVS cars to 45,700. The LTFRB estimated that Grab has 55,000 units and Uber has 77,000 registered in their systems. Around 50% of them cross between the two platforms – a practice called “dual citizenship.” “Papatayin ninyo ang hanapbuhay ng mga Pilipino (You will kill the livelihood of Filipinos),” TeamSpeed said, addressing the LTFRB. Why impose a limit? The LTFRB started limiting TNVS units as it believes these cars worsen the traffic in Metro Manila’s clogged streets. The LTFRB previously said that as more and more cars are being brought into the metro every year, road-widening projects simply cannot keep up. Transport network companies (TNCs), or the companies that manage the ride-hailing apps, also found themselves in trouble as they allowed thousands of their drivers to operate despite lacking proper registration papers. The regulatory deadlock was tackled at the Senate, where lawmakers demanded that the LTFRB fix the mess immediately for the benefit of drivers and commuters.

That was December 22, 1957. It was the first Asian Zonal, the first stage for qualifying to the world championship. The 5-player, double-robin event was held at Pines Hotel, then one of the top hotels in the country.  Dressed in suits and formal wear, the 1957 Baguio Zonal was like the old chess tournaments of the turn of the 20th century. Beneath the formality was a battle for the lone slot to the 1958 Interzonal tournament.  Rodolfo Tan Cardoso, who marked his 20th birthday on December 25, was the top favorite. The Pangasinan-born Cardoso placed fifth in the world juniors and third in the New York State Championship. He had the experienced Karl Ozols of New Zealand, the veteran Josef Porath of Israel, Safvat of Iran, Joseph Hickey of Malaya and the national champion Meliton Borja as his rivals.  Florencio Campomanes was the chief arbiter, while also filing stories for the Manila Chronicle. The Manila Times and Chronicle splashed the Baguio Zonal prominently, surpassing even their basketball coverage. Since these newspapers had chess sections, the games were analyzed by their resident chess experts.  Being the hometown favorite, Cardoso felt the pressure. Despite grabbing a big lead, things came to a head in the last 3 rounds, in the first few days of January 1958. All of the achievements Cardoso made in 1957, led by fifth place in the world juniors, which made him Asia’s first International Master. He defeated  the rising Bobby Fischer in one game of their eight-game match hosted by Pepsi Cola that the 14-year-old American won.  Cardoso “pulled out a lost game out of the fire in a dramatic time pressure scramble”, the Manila Chronicle on January 1 described his victory over Joseph Hickey of Malaya. “The time pressure scrambles became aggravated when a fuse of the Pines Hotel conked out just before the end of time control… game was resumed less than two minutes later when candle lamps were provided.”  This gave Cardoso 5.5 points, one point ahead of Ozols, whose game against Joseph Porath of Israel was adjourned.  On January 2, Cardoso salvaged a lost rook and pawn endgame against Porath and drew after 104 moves. “Porath had a clear win after Cardoso’s 95th move but two consecutive weak moves allowed Cardoso to clinch the draw,” Campomanes wrote in the Chronicle. Then Cardoso adjourned his game against Ozols, with a slight edge in material.   After 7 rounds, Cardoso led by 1.5 points, 6 points with one adjourned game. Ozols had 4.5 points but with two adjourned games, one of which where he was inferior over Porath.  On January 3, Ozols defeated Hickey in one of his adjourned game to score 5.5 points, half a point behind Cardoso, who adjourned his game against Philippine champion Meliton Borja in the 10th round. Ozols was joined by Porath with 5.5 points.  On January 4, the front pages of newspapers trumpeted “Cardoso wins Asian Zone”. In the morning where adjourned games were to be finished, Cardoso held his position against Ozols to draw and defeated Borja in the other game. This gave him a 1.5 point lead over Ozols with the 10th and final round to be played in the afternoon.  The draw with Ozols, which reached 98 moves and took 4 hours to play, was pivotal as a psychological battle took place. “(Ozols’) idea was that, in a crucial game such as they were playing, Cardoso who was ahead in material, might go out into the attack, as he was wont to do, and overreach himself,” wrote Campomanes in the Chronicle banner story,  “Cardoso himself said that there were a few times in the match where he was tempted to make enterprising sacrificial combinations but thought the better of it,” the Chronicle said.  A fighting draw between Cardoso and Porath in a non-bearing game gave Cardoso 8 points, 1.5 points ahead of Ozols. Porath, who could have changed the course of the tournament had he found the winning move against Cardoso, finished third.  Cardoso thus qualified for the 1958 Interzonal tournament in Portoroz, Yugoslavia. He did not do well, but created chess history by upsetting former world championship challenger David Bronstein in the penultimate round, ending the latter’s dreams to be king.   Sadly, Cardoso never scaled the heights although he would beat strong grandmasters. Although Cardoso’s triumph fired up Philippine chess, it took 11 years before a Filipino won the Asian Zonal through Renato Naranja. Then came Eugene Torre, and he ruled Asian chess for at least a decade with an iron hand before the Chinese players came up.  Two years after he helped lead the Philippines into the Group A final for the second time in the 1974 Olympiad, Cardoso ceased playing. He returned to chess in the 1990s, establishing his chess academy where he oversaw the budding careers of many strong players, giving them the insights from his storied career.   Cardoso’s last pupil, John Marvin Miciano, treasures two items from him. One is a compilation of his games, rewritten from the old descriptive notations to the modern algebraic notation. The second is a series of new clippings and do’s and dont’s from Cardoso. It was Miciano’s dad, Juanito, who brought Cardoso to the hospital where he passed away in 2013.  Four years after, Miciano won the national juniors and qualified to the finals of the Battle of Grandmasters for the second time. Before December ended, the FEU student got the FIDE Master title.   Cardoso’s legacy thus lives on, 60 years after victory at Pines Hotel in Baguio. The headlines from that period are gone and once more, Philippine chess starts a long climb to the heights which it once occupied. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/192994-thewrap-january-5-2018-evening-edition/","title":"Malacanang on foreign trips, Grab fare increase, Trump slams book | Evening wRap","date":"Jan 5, 2018 8:33 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Chay Hofileña","body":"Today on Rappler: Senior Deputy Executive Secretary Menardo Guevarra says fired presidential appointees cannot say their foreign trips were approved by President Rodrigo Duterte. Secretary Francisco Duque III says the Health Department will not file cases against officials who should be held accountable for the now-suspended dengue vaccination program. Grab asks the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board for a 5% fare increase. United States President Donald Trump lashes out at a bombshell-filled book about his presidency. A United States-based research shows how ‘unbridled’ connection to Facebook creates a space for coercion.  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/192968-grab-philippines-fare-hike-petition-ltfrb-train-tax-reform-law/","title":"Grab files petition for 5% fare hike","date":"Jan 5, 2018 3:09 PM PHT","snippet":"In its fare hike petition before the LTFRB, Grab cites the increased cost of vehicle maintenance and higher fuel prices with the imposition of a new tax reform law","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing company Grab on Friday, January 5, asked the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for a 5% fare increase, citing the impact of the new tax reform law on its operations.

The law brings down income tax rates, but which increases excise taxes on petroleum, cars, and vehicle spare parts. Grab said the new tax law would mean higher expenses for Grab drivers, which would require a fare increase in the company’s fare rates. “We looked into the cost of maintaining a vehicle, we looked at the lifespan of the vehicle, we looked at the price of petroleum products.

Grab is waiting for the LTFRB to schedule a hearing on its petition. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/192619-viral-air-asia-worst-airline-baggage-scheme/","title":"VIRAL: AirAsia tagged as ‘worst’ airline over baggage, PWD assistance fees","date":"Dec 31, 2017 5:33 PM PHT","snippet":"Cavite Governor Jesus Crispin Remulla slams AirAsia for being the 'lousiest airline in the world'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Budget airline AirAsia drew flak on social media as the “worst” and “lousiest” airline after Facebook user Claudette Cledera shared her bad experience during her travel on her social media account.

Leo Gonzales, public affairs manager of Grab Philippines, said the company is open to investing heavily in PUV modernization in various cities, including those outside of Metro Manila. “It can be in the form of modernized jeepneys, it can be buses, almost anything, for as long as we are able to participate in this important part of developing our transportation,” Gonzales told reporters in Cebu on Thursday, December 21. He said Grab has already approached the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to raise the idea. Gonzales added that Grab’s investment would not be limited to Metro Manila but would also include other areas where it operates, such as Cebu, Davao, Cagayan de Oro, Bacolod, Iloilo, Pampanga, and Baguio. “We have not yet gone that far into how exactly we will go about it but we want to come in as a company that will probably be able to work with local operators,” he said. Financial details of Grab’s investment plan in the PUV modernization program have not been determined yet as Gonzales said the first step would be to study existing routes and determine new routes that would be created. The company has already partnered with transport researchers to assess existing routes and possible routes, starting with Bacolod, Iloilo, and Pampanga. In Cebu, Grab is open to talking with the City Integrated Transport Cooperative (Citrasco), the biggest transport group in the province, to map out a possible partnership or investment. “We are open to talking to anyone. Now is the time for transportation operators and movers to really work together,” Gonzales said. Grab, he added, envisions a single network that would offer all modes of transportation – jeepney, bus, taxi, motorcycle, car, tricycle, and even bicycle. “If we comply with all the requirements, I am sure that the government will consider us and any other eligible player to take part in the PUV modernization program,” Gonzales said. According to the Land Transportation Office (LTO) in Central Visayas, Cebu now has a total of 574,819 registered vehicles and motorcycles to date. This means that from January to December this year, 167,889 vehicles and motorcycles were added to the existing 406,930 registered vehicles, said LTO Central Visayas Director Alita Pulga. Cebuanos have been complaining on social media about Metro Cebu’s worsening traffic. By the end of 2018, Pulga said Cebu may have 800,000 registered vehicles. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/191788-grab-taxi-new-competitor-davao-city-hirna/","title":"GrabTaxi to face new competitor in Davao City","date":"Dec 20, 2017 8:00 AM PHT","snippet":"'This is long overdue. At least now the senior citizens don't have to get wet in the rain to hail a taxi cab,' says LTFRB spokesperson Aileen Lizada","body":" DAVAO CITY, Philippines – A new mobile app-based taxi service is set to fully operate in Davao City by early 2018. Developed in partnership with local taxi operators, Hirna was unveiled here on Tuesday afternoon, December 19. The app itself, however, will not be available any time soon. “It will be launched in the very early part of next year,” said Francisco Mauricio, president of AVIS Philippines. AVIS Philippines partnered with the Metro Davao Taxi Operators Association (MDTOA) and Globe Telecom for Hirna, which they demonstrated before Mayor Sara Duterte Carpio during Tuesday’s launch.  Mauricio said Globe serves as the service’s infrastructure partner. In this set-up, he said, Hirna’s partner-drivers will will be given free data and SMS packages “to encourage drivers to use the app.” Once it starts full operation, Hirna will become Davao City’s second mobile app that taps existing taxi fleets here. In 2014, Grab launched a similar service here called GrabTaxi. Davao City was the 17th location in Southeast Asia where the Singapore-based startup launched their app.  “This is long overdue. At least now the senior citizens don’t have to get wet in the rain to hail a taxi cab. We’ve been pushing for this,” Aileen Lizada, spokesperson of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), told reporters. As a taxi-hailing service, the companies behind Hirna said they do not plan to tap private sedans, but will only limit themselves to public utility vehicles. This is to “maximize” existing taxi fleets in Davao City, said Rogelio Largo, president of MDTOA. Around 5,000 taxi drivers are targetted to be tapped by the service, according to Lizada. Users of Hirna are given access to their assigned driver’s information, which would “reduce” risks of overcharging, passenger refusal, and other illegal activities, said Largo. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/191446-newspoint-lucky-and-dangerous/","title":"[OPINION | Newspoint] Lucky and dangerous","date":"Dec 16, 2017 2:30 PM PHT","snippet":"So, how far has Rodrigo Duterte taken us down the road to authoritarianism?","body":"How far has Rodrigo Duterte taken us down the road to authoritarianism? As phrased, the question, asked widely these days, denotes authoritarianism as a destination. That is in fact what it was for us old enough to have been there.  We found ourselves there suddenly, delivered like a child snatched and carried away in its sleep. As we had done all our lives, we went to bed free men and women, but awoke tyrannized, and would remain tyrannized for 14 years. Our theft in the night was Ferdinand Marcos. He was a consummate plotter, and Duterte idolizes him, and wants to do as he did. But he is no plotter himself; he is unqualified to be one, if not altogether incapable. Where Marcos was a dark genius, he is merely dark; where he was an original, he is a mere copycat – a copycat yet driven, compulsively, messily, by a personality disorder. But he seems lucky, which makes him even more dangerous.   Preceded by a reputation built as a strongman mayor of Davao for more than two decades, he ascended to the presidency on a decisive plurality of 16 million votes from a mixed constituency of poor and not-so-poor, the former looking for a quick lift to better life, the latter taken with his aberrant charm or seeing him as an icon of the politics of patronage they subscribe to. His political star shot quickly, flashily, feeding his clinically diagnosed narcissism. He ruled a provincial city whose two million citizens populated communities so sparsely strung out in a territory 35 times the size of Manila that not enough light, whether from electric power or from political freedom, shone. Now, he rules a whole nation of more than a hundred million and wants to rule it the way he ruled Davao – dictatorially.  But, if he can’t plot like Marcos, how does he do it?  He has to continue to be lucky, and so far he’s been lucky. He has found similarly dark-minded, though not necessarily similarly mental (which is not any consolation), and substantial co-conspirators. Among them are two persistent forces: the heirs of Marcos themselves, whose suitability is defined enough by the murders and crony capitalism under their patriarch’s regime, and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Arroyo deserves special mention for at least 3 things that make for incomparable credentials:  The Lower House itself is an institutional partner. Its ridiculous 90-plus percent majority for Duterte largely comprises district patrons who see in his gang-oriented leadership a furtherance of their own interests and schemes. The quality of their fidelity and usefulness manifests most distastefully in the House justice committee’s current farcical hearings of the impeachment case against Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno.  For a president who brooks no dissent, Sereno is no surprise target: she has voted with the opposite – and losing – side in cases promoted by Duterte (notably, the Arroyo acquittal and the hero’s burial for Marcos); moreover, tenured for a further 14 years, Sereno will be staying too long to be suffered, not only by Duterte but also by her fellow justices whose seniority to her by age and length of service was cancelled out by her appointment and long tenure. Those bypassed justices happen to belong in the Supreme Court majority, as reckoned by their favorable votes in Duterte cases.  And there lies another exploitable commonality of sentiments with another institution. In fact, the impeachment hearings were opened as a platform for the justices to air their resentments, an opportunity they promptly grabbed and are now taking advantage of with such reckless alacrity they don’t seem to mind parading their own polluted sense of justice. They have been going after Sereno licentiously. Consenting to testify under rules rigged to suspend the standard right of rebuttal for the accused, they have become compromised themselves, indeed implicitly enlisting themselves for Duterte. Thought wishfully to be vulnerable to the pressure of a tradition of independent-mindedness, being elected by  national vote, the Senate is seen as the last hurdle to a power consolidation for a Duterte dictatorship. But, if its recent vote for a continuation of martial law in all of Mindanao were any indication, Duterte should feel encouraged.  The vote came even after the war against terrorists and brigands in Marawi City, itself the original justification for the emergency, had been officially declared won. Furthermore, that vote had been better than decisive – 14 to 4 – although it pales still in comparison with the House vote – 240 to 27. At any rate, with Congress and the Supreme Court in the fold, the oversight powers over the President are neutralized, and the armed forces’ hang-up on legalities is satisfied. So, how far has Duterte taken us down the road to authorianism? If we’re not already there, we’re looking right down on it. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/190831-ltfrb-slams-tv-host-for-spreading-fake-news/","title":"LTFRB slams TV host for spreading ‘fake news’","date":"Dec 9, 2017 12:07 AM PHT","snippet":"The LTFRB and TV host James Deakin lock horns over ride-hailing applications","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) slammed television host James Deakin on Friday, December 8, for supposedly spreading “fake news” on his Facebook page. Speaking to reporters in their official media chatbox, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada showed a Facebook post by Deakin, where he slammed the LTFRB for supposedly requiring too much from Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) operators like Grab and Uber drivers. (READ: What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) “A dedicated mechanic. A stock of lubricants and parts. Dedicated CCTV for their garage/workshop. A dedicated safety officer. And a helper. Even if you have just one single unit…Why, LTFRB? Why?” Deakin said in his post. In her message, Lizada said, “Fake news. Why, James, Why?” Deakin hosts television shows focusing on automobiles and has more than 400,000 followers on his Facebook page. According to the LTFRB, Deakin misunderstood the memorandum circular. In a statement, the LTFRB explained that the requirements Deakin enumerated were not required of Grab and Uber drivers, but of Public Utility Vehicle (PUV) fleet owners such as bus, jeepney, and taxi operators. “To set things right, please be informed that the requirements cited by Mr Deakin are only for vehicles operating under fleet management, and not for TNVS like the vehicles operating under Grab, Uber or U-hop,” the LTFRB said in a statement. Deakin has since then edited his post, citing Grab Philippines as the source of how he understood the guidelines. LTFRB said they have reached out to Grab too. “We, therefore, request Mr. James Deakin to uphold objectivity, accuracy, and responsible journalism in presenting his reports/opinions, through verifying details with its proper sources, so as to prevent the spread of misinformation that may delude the public,” the LTFRB added. Reacting to the LTFRB’s statement in another official chatbox, this time managed by the Department of Transportation, he said the LTFRB was flip-flopping in regulating TNVS. “The LTFRB have been treating TNVS as PUVs, but when it suits them, they are exempt?” Deakin asked. He then shared that he had earlier been kicked out of the LTFRB media chatbox, and could have been reached for clarification. “All this coming from an agency that refuses to respond to queries and kicked me out of their Viber group? Precious,” he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/190016-metro-manila-traffic-southeast-asia-study-bcg-uber/","title":"Metro Manila has 3rd worst traffic in Southeast Asia – study","date":"Nov 30, 2017 8:30 PM PHT","snippet":"A study by the Boston Consulting Group shows Metro Manila motorists and commuters get stuck in traffic for an average of 66 minutes daily","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Metro Manila commuters and motorists alike spend more than an hour, on average, in traffic every day, placing the Philippines’ capital region the 3rd worst in traffic in Southeast Asia. This was among the findings of a recent survey conducted as part of a study called “Unlocking Cities,” done by global firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The study, commissioned by ride-sharing platform Uber, looks at the impact of ridesharing in Southeast Asia. The accompanying survey was done from September to October, covering around 300 respondents from Southeast Asian cities. The survey places Metro Manila 3rd worst in the region, with an average of 66 minutes stuck in traffic daily. It comes after Bangkok, Thailand, which is said to have the worst traffic (72 minutes), and 2nd worst Jakarta, Indonesia (68 minutes). The best performers in terms of traffic are Singapore (30 minutes) and Hong Kong (35 minutes). In Metro Manila, on top of the 66-minute traffic experience, drivers also spend an average of 24 minutes per day searching for parking. Traffic woes as economy improves  The BCG survey results also indicated that traffic may worsen, as 84% of Metro Manila respondents said they plan to buy a car in the next 5 years. At the same time, however, 37% of Metro Manila respondents said they would be “highly willing” to forgo purchasing a vehicle if ridesharing can meet their transport requirements. As expected, travel time more than doubles during rush hour in the morning and in the evening, according to Metro Manila respondents.   ‘Silver lining’ A silver lining, according to the study, is that a portion of potential new vehicles could be used on ride-sharing platforms such as Grab and Uber which would, in theory, lessen the number of overall vehicles on the road at the same time.   The effect would be especially pronounced if half of those cars are used for carpool services, where users would choose to share a ride with others in exchange for a lower fare. Both Grab and Uber offer this. Assuming 50% of rides are carpool services, BCG estimates that ridesharing could potentially reduce a million private vehicles from Philippine roads. Regulatory woes, infra buildup The potential effects of ridesharing, however, assume the presence of optimal conditions which has been far from the case in the Philippines. Uber itself was recently suspended for a month in the country and fined P190 million for failure to comply with orders of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The US–based firm may face even more problems ahead as it confirmed that details of Filipino users were exposed in a data breach that has affected 57 million users worldwide. The LFTRB also recently ordered the closure of popular motorbike-hailing platform Angkas over questions of legality. Multilateral agencies have put forward the improvement of public infrastructure as a long-term solution to traffic congestion. The study echoes this, pointing out that Manila, Jakarta, and Ho Chi Minh have all announced plans to invest more than $60 billion in rail infrastructure by 2022. But according to the study, the “added capacity of rail transport alone will not be sufficient to meet growth in transport demand by 2022.” It continued: “We estimate that ridesharing adoption between 16% and 40% across these cities is needed in conjunction with public transport to maintain congestion levels today.” The Philippine government is trying to address the poor infrastructure situation with its Build, Build, Build campaign, which seeks to raise public spending on infrastructure from 5.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year to 7.4% by 2022. The clock is ticking, however, with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimating that traffic congestion would cost the country P6 billion per day by 2030 if problems are not fixed. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/188126-sepp-blatter-hope-solo-absurd-grab-ass/","title":"Blatter says Hope Solo’s ‘grabbed ass’ claim is ‘absurd’","date":"Nov 11, 2017 9:18 PM PHT","snippet":"Sepp Blatter counters Hope Solo's allegations that he sexually harassed her","body":" LAUSANNE, Switzerland – The former head of world football Sepp  Blatter said on Saturday, November 11, that claims by US women’s goalkeeper Hope Solo that he had grabbed her backside were “absurd.” Solo told Portuguese newspaper Expresso that then-FIFA president Blatter had sexually harassed her at the 2013 Ballon d’Or ceremony. The 36-year-old Solo, her country’s standout goalkeeper, claimed Blatter pounced as she was about to present an award to her teammate, Abby Wambach. “Sepp Blatter grabbed my ass, it was a few years ago at the Ballon d’Or ceremony just before I got on stage,” Solo said. However Blatter, 81, told Agence France-Presse  the accusations were “absurd and ridiculous.” Solo, a World Cup winner and two-time Olympic champion, made the allegations on the sidelines of the Web Summit being held in Lisbon. She said that sexual harassment at the hands of male officials was a common problem in women’s football. “I have seen this all of my career and I would like to see more athletes speak about their experiences,” said Solo. “It’s out of control, not just in Hollywood but everywhere,” she added in reference to the firestorm of sexual harassment allegations in entertainment, politics, and sport since the scandal involving Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein unfolded. Solo made reference to the fact that female players sometimes married their US college coaches “which obviously a coach should not be doing, especially with a young player.” Blatter was president of FIFA from 1998 to 2015 until he was banned for corruption. The Swiss official ran FIFA with an iron hand and oversaw a period in which football’s premier tournament was hosted in Asia for the first time and he paved the way for it to be held in Qatar in 2022. After the corruption allegations emerged, FIFA banned Blatter from the sport for 8 years, a term later reduced to 6 years after appeal. Blatter told AFP last month that he would attend next year’s World Cup finals in Russia at the invitation of President Vladimir Putin. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/187771-thewrap-november-8-2017-evening-edition/","title":"Del Rosario on ASEAN, Grab driver’s killer, Facebook vs revenge porn | Evening wRap","date":"Nov 8, 2017 7:52 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Chay Hofileña","body":"Today on Rappler: Former Philippine foreign secretary Albert del Rosario slams the ‘lack of leadership’ in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The killer of model Grab driver Gerardo Maquidato Jr says his victim ended up dead because he tried to fight back. Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque is confident the administration’s war on drugs will not be a thorny issue in the first meeting between President Rodrigo Duterte and United States President Donald Trump. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana says President Rodrigo Duterte aborted plans by the military to construct artisanal facilities on one of the sandbars near Pag-asa Island following a protest from China. Facebook is pilot-testing a new technology in Australia to stop revenge pornography.  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/187744-dela-rosa-grab-security-money-pnp/","title":"Dela Rosa advises Grab: Think about security, not money","date":"Nov 8, 2017 4:03 PM PHT","snippet":"This comes after a model Grab driver was killed by no less than the passenger who booked him","body":" MANILA, Philippines – After a press conference presenting the killer of a model Grab driver on Wednesday, November 6, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa went on to talk to the head of the transport giant, Brian Cu. He had one advice: Think about your drivers’ security, not the money. “Kung meron pa kayong maisip na ibang measures para ma-protektahan ‘yung mga driver, mas maganda mag-isip kayo. ‘Wag lang ‘yung palaging mag-isip kung magkanong kikitain ng Grab, ‘yung kuwan din, ‘yung security din ng mga driver ninyo, kung mas maganda ma-enhance pa ninyo. Ako advice ko lang,” Dela Rosa told Cu while surrounded by reporters. (If you can think of other measures to protect your drivers, that’s better, not just always thinking about how much Grab will earn. It’s just my advice.) Dela Rosa’s warning did not come out of nowhere, as the top cop said that criminals have focused on other crimes ever since the Duterte administration focused on bringing down the illegal drug trade. “Hirap na sila sa drugs, wala nang mapagkitaan sa drugs pupunta sa kidnapping at hold-up. Magshi-shift sila doon eh, so bantayan natin,” he added. (They’re having a hard time doing drugs so they are going to kidnapping and hold-upping. They are shifting there so let’s keep watch.) The “good Samaritan” Grab driver Gerardo Maquidato Jr, was shot dead by his own passenger who attempted to rob him. The self-confessed killer Narc Delemios said the driver fought back while he was attempting the robbery. The claim was dismissed by Maquidato’s family.  In an interview after his conversation with the top cop, Brian Cu said tightening the security for passengers and drivers is a balancing act for them. “If we will make it too hard for people to register it will deter riders and reduce the convenience, so that’s the balance that we have to do. We are working on things that would provide safety to drivers, and in effect, safety to the passengers as well,” he said. So far, the transport network company (TNC) has allowed its drivers to implement a “No ID, No entry” policy, allowing them to decline trips from passengers who cannot prove that their accounts used to pick up rides match their real identities. Cu also said they are planning to create a “blacklist” database of passengers who are rude or abusive to their drivers. “So we call on other TNCs to work with us: form a safety committee that would blacklist passengers so we can report that immediately to the relevant authorities, both for passengers and drivers,” Cu said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/187730-model-grab-driver-fought-back-killer/","title":"Model Grab driver ‘fought back,’ says killer","date":"Nov 8, 2017 3:07 PM PHT","snippet":"The wife of Grab driver Gerardo Maquidato Jr confronts suspect Narc Delemios, when he is presented to the media in Camp Crame","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The killer of model Grab driver Gerardo Maquidato Jr claimed on Wednesday, November 8, that his victim ended up dead because he tried to fight back.

He apologized to members of Maquidato’s family, who were there, and said he only intended to rob the Grab driver. “Alam ko po na mahirap akong mapatawad ng pamilya ng na-ano kong driver.

Maquidato was killed on October 26, after he was booked by Delemios.  Police said Delemios cancelled his trip around 45 minutes into the ride. It was unclear whether he shot Maquidato and left his body in Pasay City during that period. Contrary to previous reports, it seemed that Delemios acted alone. Asked for the motive of Delemios’ surrender, National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) chief Director Oscar Albayalde said that Delemios decided to turn himself in because of pressure from his family. Delemios apparently already sent surrender feelers to the police a few days prior to his actual surrender.

Pasay City Police on Monday, November 6, identified the suspect, who was among those who posed as regular Grab passengers of Maquidato, as Narc Tulod Delemios of Block 23 Lot 2, Don Carlos Revilla Street, Narra Extension, Barangay 148, Pasay City. Tulod and his still-unidentified companions booked a ride with Maquidato on the night of October 26 before shooting and killing him. A witness said he heard gunshots around 7:50 pm and saw the lifeless body of the Grab driver pushed out of his silver Toyota Innova along Bonanza Street in Pasay City. The suspects then took off with Maquidato’s car. Delemios was identified by his live-in partner, who admitted to police that it was her cellphone that was used to book the Grab trip. Meanwhile another witness said Delemios was also a suspect in the killing of 19-year-old Gino Balbuena in 2014. A sworn statement by the witness, who asked not to be identified for safety reasons, said Delemios shot and killed Balbuena while they were playing cara y cruz in the early morning of October 10, 2014, at the corner of Bagong Sikat Street and Dimasalang Extension in Baclaran. Delemios, the witness said in the statement, was with a certain Jeric Lim, who served as “back-up” in the incident.  Balbuena’s sister said a possible motive for the killing of Gino was a petty quarrel in a basketball game.  Maquidato was one of Grab Philippines’ driver awardees, recognized for giving a courtesy ride to a sick passenger. A Facebook post, which went viral in August 2016, commended Maquidato for picking up a diabetes patient on her way to collect bags of blood for her dialysis. Maquidato did not charge his passenger for fare out of kindness. (Read the Facebook post here.)  Because of the killing of Maquidato, Grab Philippines has implemented a “No ID, No Entry” policy, allowing their driver-partners to ask passengers for personal identification cards before letting them onto their cars.   “Before starting the trip, our driver-partners may ask you to show a personal identification card (ID) to verify your identity, especially during nightshift hours.

The suspects are still at large, thus the tightened measures, Grab said. In addition, Grab also advised passengers to make sure that what they set as their pick up and drop off points are correct as Grab drivers will only follow what they set.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will meet with his cabinet at 10.00 am (0800 GMT) to set out specific powers it plans to take away from the wealthy northeast region, which currently enjoys wide autonomy including control over its own policing, education and healthcare. The measures – which take the country into uncharted legal waters – come after Spain’s King Felipe VI on Friday blasted what he said was an “unacceptable secession attempt” and said the crisis sparked by the region’s banned October 1 independence referendum must be resolved “through legitimate democratic institutions”. “We do not want to give up that which we have built together,” he pleaded. Madrid enjoys constitutional powers to wrest back control of rebellious regions in one of the Western world’s most decentralised nations, but it has never used them. Autonomy is a hugely sensitive issue in semi-autonomous Catalonia, which saw its powers taken away under Spain’s military dictatorship. Home to 7.5 million people, the region fiercely defends its own language and culture. ‘Critical point’ There are fears of unrest if Madrid seeks to impose direct rule of any kind, and Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has said such a move could push regional lawmakers to declare unilateral independence. But Rajoy said Friday that Spain had reached a “critical point” after weeks of political limbo and that his government had to act to stop the rule of law being “liquidated”. Rajoy is likely to announce plans to take control of Catalonia’s 16,000-strong police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, whose leader Josep Lluis Trapero could face up to 15 years in jail on sedition charges for failing to contain separatist protests ahead of the referendum. Madrid could also seek to force new elections – its preferred solution to Spain’s most protracted political crisis since it returned to democracy in 1977 – as early as January. Rajoy is due to hold a press conference early Saturday afternoon to announce his plans, which must pass through the Senate where his conservative Popular Party holds a majority — a process that would take about a week. Speaking on Friday night at the Princess of Asturias Awards – Spain’s answer to the Nobels – King Felipe described Catalonia as “an essential part of 21st century Spain”. ‘Hellish mess’ EU leaders, who were at the ceremony to collect a prize for encouraging harmony in Europe, used their acceptance speeches to demand respect for the law in words that offered implicit backing to Madrid. “Some are sowing discord by deliberately ignoring law,” European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said at the awards night in the northern city of Oviedo. He added pointedly: “All too often in the past the prospect of redrawing borders has been presented as a heavenly panacea that has resulted in a hellish mess.” As tensions continue to run high, independence supporters are set to rally in Barcelona Saturday evening calling for the release of Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez, the leaders of two powerful grassroots separatist groups who have been in jail since Monday pending investigation into sedition charges. Puigdemont says he has a mandate to declare independence after the referendum, which his administration says resulted in a 90% Yes vote. But turnout was given as only 43% as many Catalans who back unity stayed away from the banned vote. Accounting for about a fifth of Spain’s economic output, Catalonia is evenly split over whether to break away from Spain, according to polls. Supporters say the wealthy region does too much to prop up the rest of the national economy and would thrive if it went its own way, but opponents say Catalonia is stronger as part of Spain and that a split would spell economic and political disaster. Nearly 1,200 companies that have shifted their registered domiciles to other parts of Spain since the referendum, hoping to minimise instability. Madrid this week cut its national growth forecast for next year from 2.6% to 2.3%, saying the standoff was creating uncertainty. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/bahasa-indonesia/184804-singapore-airlines-grab-rewards/","title":"Singapore Airlines kolaborasi dengan Grab, bagaimana di Indonesia?","date":"Oct 10, 2017 1:07 PM PHT","snippet":"Banyak ide-ide segar lahir dari startup.

So, if you see no rhyme or reason in what he says or does, don’t search; there’s none. He goes off on impulse, as triggered. That’s why he swings from one extreme position to the other. He vowed, for instance, to sail the West Philippine Sea bearing his nation’s flag and to plant it in an island grabbed by the Chinese, only to capitulate, even kowtow, to them later. With the local communists, his relationship has been a love-hate one, as reflected in the on-again-off-again peace talks between them and the government. And to the United States, for which he has had only the worst epithets, he suddenly warms up, declaring himself “your humble friend.” If Duterte shows any consistency in anything at all, it’s in his relentless and ruthless war on drugs, but that’s only because it’s about the only trick this pony knows. He prosecutes this war with a killer’s instinct, although that instinct seems prejudiced against the poor. The characteristic illogic here is that the poor make up most, if not nearly all, of the thousands of dead in the war’s first year alone, yet he had always made a dramatic case of being once a poor boy himself. Anyway, his poor-boy story had its own limited run. He had to revise it once suitably triggered again, this time to portray himself as a scion of a landed family coming to a P3-million inheritance as a teenager more than 50 years ago. Possibly, Duterte’s new tale was inspired by a tipoff that the Office of the Ombudsman had gotten hold of bank records that lend credence to charges of unexplained wealth brought against Duterte by Senator Antonio Trillanes IV. Sure and soon enough, the tipoff proved correct; the overall deputy ombudsman, Arthur Carandang, confirmed that his and Trillanes’ documents are “more or less” a match. Trillanes had asked the Ombudsman, former Supreme Court Justice Conchita Carpio-Morales, to look into the case, but she inhibited herself, being an aunt of Duterte’s son-in-law, and passed the task to Carandang, who found that, indeed, Duterte had a lot of explaining to do. If Duterte had been prescient enough to put his inheritance in 3 pieces of property in Forbes Park, the premier rich man’s ghetto, in Makati, and sold now, he would have realized a billion pesos, precisely equal the amount shown to have found its way into his family’s bank accounts. But Carandang’s and Trillanes’ documents show no such simple transactions; they show, rather, sums flowing across a network of bank accounts. Trillanes did not say where he got his documents. In his own case, Carandang points to the Anti-Money Laundering Council, but it denies being the source. In any case, the Office of the Ombudsman says that it “stands by its word.” And responding to Duterte’s threat to have the office investigated for corruption, it says that it “shall not be intimidated” and that it in fact “welcomes… efforts to help it cleanse its ranks.” At any rate, the unsorted question about who provided the bank records loses much of its relevance in the glare of the damning evidence the records themselves reveal. Understandably, any anomaly involving the president – in particular a president so easily provoked to retaliate as Duterte – is most likely to disperse blamable functionaries. As it happens, the chairman of the Anti-Money Laundering Council is Duterte’s recent appointee as Central Bank governor. To be sure, taking on the president – any president – under any circumstances is sensitive business, to say the least. For one thing, the president cannot be sued while in office. He may be impeached by the House of Representatives and tried by the Senate, but the prospect is an improbable one for Duterte since he commands a massive majority in both houses. All that immunity, however, does not shield him from being investigated and revealed for wrongdoing. In fact, with his net worth, he is required by law to be truthful and transparent, and that’s precisely the duty Trillanes and Carandang are trying to get Duterte to fulfill, so that the people’s right to know may be satisfied. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/lifestyle-and-entertainment/183411-shakeys-ber-bundle-christmas/","title":"Why does Christmas in the Philippines start in September?","date":"Sep 26, 2017 5:25 PM PHT","snippet":"Experts weigh in on why among all other countries, Christmas is celebrated the longest in the Philippines","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Nations all have a way of marking the start of the Christmas season around the world. In the United States, the holidays officially begin on Thanksgiving in November while in Italy, a fellow Catholic country, decorations are only put up on December 8th or the day of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. {source}  {/source} In the Philippines, the Christmas season kicks off on September 1st or the start of the so-called ‘BER months’ – more than three months before the actual Christmas day. Christmas songs start playing on the radio and in the malls, holiday promos from airlines pop up, invitations from friends and family to get together and eat out start coming in, and Christmas trees, balls, and lights now occupy every department store’s racks – literally overnight.  We grew up practicing this tradition but where did it really all start? Whoever said we should start celebrating Christmas in September? You might think it’s because we, Filipinos, are mostly Catholic. It’s one possible reason but according to sociologist, Bro. Clifford Sorita, if we look at the Liturgical Calendar, the Advent season or the preparation for the Nativity of Jesus Christ begins four Sundays before Christmas day which is around the last week of November or early December. Is there a particular event in history that started this tradition? After much research, no one can say, said Bro. Sorita. It was just something that was practiced in Filipino households even before there were Jose Mari Chan and Mariah Carey memes announcing the first of September on social media. We have always been festive and we like grabbing the opportunities to come together as a family to enjoy a generous spread of food on the table. Then, is Christmas in September just a marketing stunt? A tradition invented by malls and manufacturers of ham and quezo de bola? “This tradition is not created by malls. Malls and brands only respond to people’s behaviors,” Bro. Sorita assures us.    “It may appear that malls have a huge influence on the extended celebration of Christmas in the Philippines. It makes sense that these retail outlets would capitalize on the practice to generate increased demand for toys and other gift items that we often buy during the Yuletide season,” Ed Timbungco, corporate communications consultant and PR professor at De La Salle–College of St. Benilde explains. “But it’s more than just a marketing stunt. Filipinos supported the extended observance of Christmas because we are really suckers for anything that will allow us to celebrate and spend more time with our loved ones.” So, what exactly is the reason behind this long-standing tradition? It turns out, the answer lies within us. “The most simple explanation for the Philippines’ long Christmas season is our psychological framework to count down the days to big celebrations,” said Bro. Sorita. “100 days until Christmas start on September 16th but we, Filipinos, we always like to start celebrating earlier.” “By knowing exactly how much time we have remaining to complete a task, instead of stressing about it, we will be able to better allocate our time. In fact, a 100-day countdown also acts as a secondary motivator and reinforces us Filipinos to complete our Christmas tasks before the big day.” In other words, our brains are hardwired to think of the months ahead of Christmas as a chance to buy gifts, to put up the Christmas tree and other decorations, to plan the Noche Buena, and to schedule Christmas parties. Most importantly, we use this time to get together with family, friends, and colleagues we haven’t seen all year over good food just like how our ancestors did. Probably the reason why this tradition has been successfully passed on from generation to generation.  And in these get-togethers, we like sticking to our comfort food favorites like Shakey’s. Now with the Shakey’s BER Bundle that comes with a free upsize of your all-time favorite pizza and chicken, plus a free Mojos Supreme, you can spend more time with more friends, family, and loved ones while counting down to Christmas.   “We celebrate Christmas the longest, first because we don’t want happy moments to end. We look forward to family gatherings and reunions so we can make up for lost time. Celebrations are very much a part of our psyche as fiesta-loving and I don’t see anything wrong with that,” said Prof. Timbungco.

Reached for comment, Uber Communications head Cat Avelino said it was “zero incidents for Uber.” Cu said Grab Delivery, the service supposedly being used to send narcotics, records over 20,000 dispatches a week, and that it would be unfair to fault the thousands for the error of a few. “What I don’t want to happen is for regulators to see our technology and our service for the minority of users that are using it for crimes, and ending up shutting down a service that benefits a vast majority,” Cu added. (READ: What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) While Uber does not have a delivery service, its patrons use their service to send packages through the regular booking service, asking drivers to bring packages to the users’ destinations. Vigilance asked from drivers In the same briefing, PNP HPG head Chief Superintendent Arnel Escobal said the suppression of such practices primarily lies in the hands of the delivery drivers. “Grab partners, you are not [a] law enforcement agency pwede niyong buklatin [ang deliveries] (you can open the deliveries), unlike us law enforcers parang abuse yun (it’s like abuse), we need a warrant para buksan ‘yun (to open them),” Escobal said. He explained that his officers cannot just stop delivery services in the middle of the road without prior knowledge of what they expect to find. Cu agreed with Escobal, announcing that they have already begun informing and reminding their drivers that they can open and refuse packages sent through Grab Delivery. He assured Grab drivers that they will not impose penalties on them if they refuse. Uber’s Avelino added that they do the same for their “partners.” “We regularly remind our driver partners to take precaution and only fulfill trips with riders [or] passengers,” Avelino said.  Escobal warned delivery drivers, however, that they should be more vigilant, for if they are caught delivering illegal drugs, they can be charged as accomplices to the crime. “So immediately, when it comes to his knowledge i-report kaagad niya (one should report it immediately),” he added. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/182908-anchesta-powerlifting-gold-para-games/","title":"Adeline Dumapong-Ancheta grabs powerlifting gold in 2017 ASEAN Para Games","date":"Sep 21, 2017 3:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Veteran para athlete Adeline Dumapong-Ancheta picked up another gold for the Philippines as she dominated the women’s over 86-kg powerlifting event in the 2017 ASEAN Para Games","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Veteran para athlete Adeline Dumapong-Ancheta picked up another gold for the Philippines as she dominated the women’s over 86-kg powerlifting event in the 2017 ASEAN Para Games on Thursday, September 21 at the Malaysia International Trade & Exhibition Centre in Kuala Lumpur.  Dumapong-Ancheta, 43, registered a best lift of 116-kg en route to another gold medal in her decorated career.

The Philippine men’s poomsae team grabbed its third straight gold medal since 2013 at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games on Saturday, August 26 here. The team had one different member during the 2013 gold, but this team – comprised of brothers Dustin and Rico Mella as well as Rodolfo Reyes Jr – has been together since 2015. Dustin, 22, admitted they were conscious about not sticking to the same old formula every two years. “We had to reinvent. Because once you’re on top, it’s harder to maintain,” he said after they notched a final score of 8.37 at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. “So we tried to figure something new, we added new types of training to boost our performance.” That included employing a conditioning coach to guide them through training with weights in the gym, and then incorporating that into skills training. They began training for the SEA Games at the start of the year. Their hardwork resulted in averages of 3.40 in accuracy and 4.97 in presentation during their event. “I feel proud,” said Dustin, a fresh graduate of the University of the Philippines Diliman with a degree in Business Economics. “I don’t have anything else to say but that I’m happy. I’m happy for us and our country.” Dustin also shared how he also had to juggle time with school (before he graduated) and training, as well as his job as a coach of the National Univesity poomsae team (after he graduated). {source}<iframe width=”560″ height=”315″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/VkA4jbLaZQI” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe>{/source}   Meanwhile, his younger brother Rico, 21, is still studying at De La Salle University and taking up Computer Science major in Computer Systems Engineering. “I always tell myself that I have a reason to fight and one of those reasons is I fight for my heart, I fight like my life depends on it,” Rico said after the win. Reyes, also 22 and only a few weeks older than Dustin, studied Education at the University of Santo Tomas. The trio are now eyeing participation in the Asian Games next year in Indonesia. It will be the first time taekwondo poomsae will be included in the Asiad. The event isn’t even in the Olympics yet. There’s no assurance they will be the team to represent the Philippines next year, but they’re willing to put in the work. “Within the national team no one is irrepplaceable,” Dustin said. “If you relax and someone works harder than you, he can replace you.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/180149-clinton-kingsley-bautista-bronze-110m-hurdles-2017-southeast-asian-games/","title":"Clinton Kingsley Bautista grabs bronze for PH in 110m hurdles","date":"Aug 26, 2017 6:14 PM PHT","snippet":"The former UAAP MVP Bautista registers a time of 14.15 seconds to cop the 3rd spot in the SEA Games","body":" MANILA, Philippines－ Trackster Clinton Kingsley Bautista delivered another podium finish for the Philippine athletics team when he snatched the bronze in the 29th Southeast Asian Games men’s 110m hurdles event on Saturday, August 26 at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium in KL Sports City, Malaysia.

In the past 6 years alone, our country has managed to win the elusive Miss World crown and came very close to snagging it twice. Several of the runners-up of Miss World Philippines have found success in other national pageants. Most notably Rachel Peters, Miss Universe Philippines 2017 and Nelda Ibe, Bb. Pilipinas Globe 2017, both of whom competed in the 2014 edition and finished 4th Runner-up and 2nd Runner-up respectively. We also have Janicel Lubina, Bb. Pilipinas International 2015, who was 1st Runner-up to Megan Young in 2013. Aside from their standout beauty and charming personalities, there is one more thing that is common to all of these winners. They are all part of one of two major beauty camps in the Philippine pageant scene. Aces & Queens and Kagandahang Flores have trained many of the most successful beauty queens in recent history. It is no wonder that many aspiring beauty delegates dream of being accepted in one of these camps. They are trained in runway and Q&A but also have access to hair and makeup tutorials and to some of the countries leading fashion designers.   In this year’s edition of the MIss World Philippines pageant, there are 12 official candidates from Aces & Queens and 10 candidates from Kagandahang Flores. Surprisingly, there are also 13 official candidates who have decided to go at it without a camp. They are known as the independent candidates. I interviewed 10 of the 13 candidates to find out why they chose to join as an independent.    #4 Rose Flores, 24 years old, Makati City  Who or what convinced you to join MWP 2017? I have looked up to the Miss World queens ever since I was a little girl so, in the back of my mind, I always knew that I would eventually end up here. But in terms of preparations, I’ve been preparing for almost 3 years. Did you intentionally join as an independent ? Not at all. In the past years of preparations I have been doing also involved looking for a camp to train me. I’m very hardworking so I didn’t want to slack off. I wanted to get as much training as possible. A few months prior to the screening, I still couldn’t find any camp to train me, which made me decide that it was my destiny to join independently and do my best to prove young girls and dreamers that they can win with enough determination and hard work.  Many of the recent winners in almost all the pageants come from beauty camps, how does that affect you? Absolutely, I have done my research about each Filipina queen and which camp they belong to. But I also realized that joining independently does not mean I work less than those who are in a camp. In fact, it’s quite challenging at times because it requires me to save up to be able to provide the things I need for the competition. That is also why it took me this long to prepare: I had to prepare myself not just physically and mentally but also financially. Were you ever part of a camp or did you try to join any camp? I have tried joining a camp a few times but nothing really pushed through so I went on strategizing on my own instead. I didn’t want to waste any time. After all, one of my strongest qualities as a woman is that I am very independent given that I was a working student and now an entrepreneur. I’m am not going to let any rejection or obstacle belittle my dream because this is what I believe I should be doing. I don’t expect anyone else to understand my calling in life. What is the advantage of being an independent candidate? The biggest advantage is that I can focus solely on myself, on the organization I wish to work with, and looking far beyond what comes after winning a crown and what I wish to do with my reign. I feel very lucky to have the support of people in the industry that I cannot wait to give credit to. So never give up on your dream.    #7 Jane Darren Genobisa,  20 years old, Bansalan, Davao del Sur  Who or what convinced you to join MWP 2017? I’ve joined several local beauty pageants but I’ve never won a crown. It made me doubt myself. But I still decided to join Miss World Philippines because I want to prove to myself that I can do it. At the same, I want to grab the opportunity to have a bigger voice and greater influence to help those who are in need especially the orphans, abused and abandoned children, and those kids who were casualties of war in our island Mindanao to have a better and a brighter future thru education and proper shelter.  Since I was orphaned at early age, I understand and know how they feel. For the past 6 years, I have participated in community outreach projects and programs. Since the mantra of Ms. World Philippines is beauty with a purpose, so I took a chance.  Did you intentionally join as an independent? Yes , because I don’t know anybody here in Manila. I just bravely tried my luck and here I am. Many of the recent winners in almost all pageants come from beauty camps, how does that affect you? It doesn’t affect me at all but it challenges me to shine brightest among the stars. And I think winning the crown depends on your own performance and destiny. Were you ever part of a camp or did you try to join any camp before? I’ve never been a part of any camp before. But honestly, I passed an application for a certain camp when they had their national auditions but they snubbed me. It’s fine, maybe they will get me in the future.   What is the advantage of being an independent candidate? I think the advantage of being an independent is that it will teach you a sense of self-reliance.  No one will pressure you to win the crown or stress you much. You go on your own pace.   #10 Leida Babasanta, 22 years old, Santa Rosa, Laguna   When did you decide to join MWP 2017?  After finding out about the screening of Miss World Philippines, I just took the chance and gave it my best shot. Now that I am an official candidate, this is the moment of truth. I will give my 100% to have a very respectable finish in this prestigious competition. The person who convinced me to join was the same person who opened the door to the world of pageants to me, Hon. Donna Babasanta, my uncle and my mentor as well the founder of Hitomi of Santa Rosa, Laguna, a group of local beauty title holders in the province of Laguna. I look up to him.  Did you intentionally join as an independent? I still consider myself as an independent candidate even though I am the first and only candidate for Hitomi of Santa Rosa. We have finally decided to bring out the best in our local beauties and compete in prestigious beauty pageants such as Miss World Philippines. We believe that Miss World Philippines is a very good place to start. Many of the recent winners in almost all pageants come from beauty camps, how does that affect you? Independent or coming from a camp both have its pros and cons. To be independent is not a minus factor. What makes it better when you come from a camp is that you have proper training and you benefit from the support structure.  Were you ever part of a camp or did you try to join any camp before?  I had initial training with KF back in 2015, which helped me a lot. But being the first for Hitomi of Santa Rosa is a big thing for me and my humble beauty camp.  What is the advantage of being an independent candidate?  The advantage of being independent you can bring out the best in you and focus on yourself alone.   #27 Ella Eiveren, 20 years old, Sta. Rosa, Laguna  Who convinced you to join MWP 2017? My handler, Marc Torres, initially asked me to join MWP. At first I got scared and was not so sure about the idea of joining MWP because I had doubts about myself – whether I was ready for this or not especially since I’m about to graduate this semester. However, I knew deep down inside of me that this what I wanted and what I’m really passionate about so I finally decided to take a leap of faith and joined. Did you intentionally join as an independent? Yes. Wala lang po talaga kasi akong (I really don’t have a) camp and haven’t tried to join beauty camps but if given a chance to join one, it would be my pleasure. Many of the recent winners in almost all pageants come from beauty camps, how does that affect you? I don’t really think of it that way. Yes, they may have an advantage compared to independent candidates as they are well trained beforehand in their own camps but I think that the recent winners of pageants won simply because they deserved it. They have shown the grace, unique beauty, talent, and intelligence needed to win that crown. Were you ever part of a camp or did you try to join any camp before? I haven’t been part of any camp and I also haven’t tried to join any.  What is the advantage of being an independent candidate?  I guess, since through time, both beauty camps have revealed their “legend” or “trademark” or “standards,” members of beauty camps may feel a bit pressured since they somehow have the whole camp’s expectations to meet while independent candidates probably feel less pressured since we only need to satisfy our own expectations.   #28 Sheila Reyes, 22 years old, Valenzuela City   Who or what convinced you to join MWP 2017? I was inspired by the empowered women in my family, and this has been my greatest dream ever since I was a kid. I decided to join MWP early this year but since I was so focused with work and dancing, I haven’t had the chance to really train with any camps. Did you intentionally join as an independent? Yes, but I’m getting all sorts of help from my supporters and handlers in Valenzuela City, they are all very helpful.  Many of the recent winners in almost all pageants come from beauty camps, how does that affect you?  I think camps are of big help to young women like me when it comes with beauty pageants. Were you ever part of a camp or did you try to join any camp before? I screened for Aces and Queens last 2015 but unfortunately, I was rejected because I looked too young. But that did not stop me from pursuing what I love. Recently, I have received invitations from camps but I opted to stay with my handlers for Miss World. But I’m very open to future opportunities. What is the advantage of being an independent candidate? I think it’s nice to be a part of a camp and I think that’s nice to be independent too, because I’m able my explore things on my own.   #29 Krystle Onjangco, 24 years old, Filipino Community of Los Angeles   Who or what convinced you to join MWP 2017?  I decided to join last year upon hearing about Catriona Gray. I was inspired by her cause because I too have this passion to tap the potentials of the youth into an active manifestation of their abilities to shape a better world. Did you intentionally join as an independent ? Yes, I wanted to root my journey not on who I am but the cause that I am bringing forward through Miss World Philippines.   Many of the recent winners in almost all pageants come from beauty camps, how does that affect you? It does not. I believe in what the camps are doing to help the ladies and I am happy for them but as an independent candidate, with my handler, Jontie Martinez, being focused on me and having that close connection, makes me feel stronger and more empowered. Were you ever part of a camp or did you try to join any camp before? I was with the Aces and Queens camp early this the year.  What is the advantage of being an independent candidate? I can rely on my own perspectives. I have more liberal decisions. My choices are more personal, with the support of my handler. Ultimately, I am able to join without sacrificing who I am.   #30 Kathleen Gomez, 23 years old, Balete, Batangas   When did you decide to join MWP 2017?  I decided to join MWP when I became inspired by former Miss World Megan Young. I saw how dedicated and passionate she was about her responsibilities, especially with regard to the youth. Before and until now, I used to help people in small ways. Buying food for street children and giving them some clothes and toiletries. But I’m not the type of person who posts everything on social media. I want to be discreet with any charitable acts I do. It makes me feel satisfied and happy. But after our seminar at Rappler, I learned that posting some things on social media can also be inspiring. Poor people, especially the children, convinced me more to join MWP. I want to be the voice for and the second mother of those children, especially the victims of violence.  Did you intentionally join as an independent? Yes, I intentionally joined as an independent because I really want to prove to myself that I can do everything without being involved in the camps. I really wanna feel how to be an independent person. I also want to inspire people to accomplish any tasks with just yourself, without the help of anyone. Many of the recent winners in almost all pageants come from beauty camps, how does that affect you? Of course I was so scared and it’s really hard to thinkof myself as being an underdog ’cause you don’t belong to any of the camps who could help you a lot on different things. But instead of losing my confidence, I became more challenged on proving that I can do all things by myself. Its very challenging and I think it’s also nice. Were you ever part of a camp or did you try to join any camp before? Some people had talked to me about joining their camps and I was so flattered. But I didnt commit to any of them because I want to experience how it feels to be an independent candidate. After MWP, maybe I’ll be encouraged to join one of those great camps. What is the advantage of being an independent candidate?  I think the advantage of being an independednt candidate is that you can move more freely. You can schedule your own time, you can have your own training any time you want, you can do workouts anytime you want, and no one else will dictate your movements. And this will make you more of a strong person.   #33 Noelle Uy-Tuazon, 25 years old, Davao City  When did you decide to join MWP 2017? It was actually a last minute decision because I had just screened for Bb. Pilipinas last February and was traumatized. However I ran into my uncle, Tito Hansel Villafuerte, and he encouraged me to join. I had thought that Miss World was already done with this year’s screening but when my tito told me it would be in a couple of weeks, I decided to join last minute. Miss World has been a dream of mine ever since I was a little girl. I’m grateful that I have this chance. Did you intentionally join as an independent? Initially, I intended to join with a camp and not as independent, but I was having difficulty getting in touch with the camps. So I decided to ask my mother for assistance and ask family members on tips regarding how to approach this contest. Earlier in the year, I recall crying to my mom because I couldn’t get in touch with the camps despite asking help for just a mere meeting. So when I decided to join last minute, I stuck it out and went independent with my family’s unrelenting support. I figured I’ve been independent this far on so why not just persevere and so far my mom and uncle have been very helpful with posture and walking.  Many of the recent winners in almost all pageants come from beauty camps, how does that affect you? The history of beauty queens coming from camps has been intimidating, to be frank. During the beginning of MWP, that’s when I felt the pressure to truly be on top of the competition because all of these ladies are so well trained in posture, angles, and walking. This is my first pageant so in a way everything that I’m experiencing is new to me. I’m a scientist by training and not used to being in front of the camera or using makeup everyday – especially having spent most of my earlier 20s in a body farm working with decomposing human remains. On the other hand, I think having women from camps is also good for the pageant because it gives that element of diversity, but at a personal level it puts a lot of pressure for independent candidates such as myself. Were you ever part of a camp or did you try to join any camp before?  I have never been part of a camp but it was only this year that I tried joining a beauty pageant because I was always busy studying and working. I had tried to join a camp when I first got back from the US, but I couldn’t get in touch with them and with the forensic studies that I was doing at the time, it sadly just didn’t work out. What is the advantage of being an independent candidate? I believe one of the advantages of being an independent is having the freedom over one’s schedule. Most importantly, the freedom to really research and choose the team that you want to help you – from designers to instructors. Also being an independent gives one the advantage of standing out because the runway walk that one would develop would be different from the styles of those coming from camps. Subtle details such as walks and angling would differ from the candidates coming from camps even if it’s as minuscule as where one’s hand is placed during a stance. So in a lot of ways being an independent isn’t all that bad because one can truly understand all the mechanics for a beauty pageant. We have to do everything else ourselves, we have to research and try everything to see what really works for us. We don’t have the luxury of having a set program to follow. Instead, we have to be like scientists searching for information and testing it like an experiment.   #35 Sophia Senoron, 17 years old, City of Manila   Who or what convinced you to join MWP 2017? I decided to join Miss World after my coronation as the Generation East Grand Winner of 2017. The pageant made me realize how influential beauty queens are in the Philippines and how they act as platforms to spread awareness about our ideologies. A little light bulb went on in my head and I realized that I shouldn’t wait for my country to change: I should be the change my country needs. I did research on Miss World and the motto “Beauty with a Purpose” appealed to me. I want to serve God, my country, and my people using my strengths. This is my purpose.  Did you intentionally join as an independent?  I joined as an independent because I wanted to prove that women don’t need to be “trained” or “made into” beauty queens. A true beauty queen is a woman true to herself and confident in her ways. Through that confidence, a woman can influence and lead. Most of all I wanted to see how far I can take myself, to become the woman I was raised to be – how my own obstacles in life have shaped me and what lessons they have taught me. I want the Philippines to be confident in me. Many of the recent winners in almost all pageants come from beauty camps, how does that affect you? Well, I choose to believe that is the heart and brain of the woman beneath the crown that won the hearts of her people not the camp.  Were you ever part of a camp or did you try to join any camp before? My former handler was associated with a beauty camp. I had cut connections with my handler and therefore the beauty camp because he didn’t believe I had a chance at winning the crown. What is the advantage of being an independent candidate?  Advantages? I think the advantage of being an independent candidate is also the advantage of the people we wish to represent.    #31 Jeanyfer Ozbot  Who or what convinced you to join MWP 2017?   “I decided to join MWP this year.  I was planning and waiting for the good sign & when I saw their post i grabbed the opportunity.  I sent all the requirements and was the first applicant who arrived since I was so excited. It’s my decision to join MWP because I really want to experience a national pageant and want to represent Iloilo City.”  Did you intentionally join as an independent?  “I intentionally joined as an independent. There is still alot of training also even as an independent. Having a camp doesn’t guarantee your success. At the end of the day, the most important is how you perform, your guts and determination and your attitude.” Many of the recent winners in almost all pageants come from beauty camps, how does that affect you? “Yes, most of the winners have a camp. But then it’s not the end of the world because sooner there is  an independent girl who will win. I was so happy because the MWP organizers accepts independent. It’s our time to showcase our beauty, talent and wit.”  Were you ever part of a camp or did you try to join any camp before? “I have never been part or tried to join a camp. But I want to now because I’m willing to learn more & be trained.  What is the advantage of being an independent candidate?  “I think as an independent you can be friends with everyone. No pressure. I can do what ever I want and I can decide whatever i really want to wear.”   It takes a very strong woman to decide to be an independent candidate since, statistically, the odds are against them. But more than just a beautiful face, they have the fighting spirit and determination to rise above the convention and triumph. They are creating their own path and lighting their own way to success.     On September 3, 2017, we will find out if these independent candidates will break the winning streak of the camps and pull a major upset. – Rappler.com    Voltaire has 10 years experience in the fashion industry.

The win brightened moods of Pinoy basketball fans after Gilas was eliminated from contention with a one-sided loss to South Korea in the quarterfinals, and was beaten by Lebanon in the battle for fifth place. Terrence Romeo’s clutch 3-pointer with 46 seconds remaining cut Jordan’s lead to one point, and Aguilar’s lay-up under the basket gave Gilas the lead, 71-70, with 12.6 remaining. Romeo also got things done on the defensive side as his steal attempt on the ensuing inbounds pass forced a turnover for Jordan, which led to Gilas cushioning for the win. Gilas Pilipinas let go of 10-5 lead but was unable to keep their defense intact and let Jordan grab a 7-0 run to end the first quarter with a 17-all deadlock. Philippines unleashed a strong offensive blow in the second period behind Jayson Castro and Terrence Romeo’s killer treys for an 8-0 blitz to grab the lead at halftime, 35-27.

The host country Lebanon stepped on the offensive pedal with a 7-0 run early in the match but Gilas Pilipinas tried trimming the lead with behind back-to-back three-pointers and a two-handed slam from Japeth Aguilar to close the first quarter behind 29-18. Philippines managed to intensify their offense with Jayson Castro unleashing two consecutive triples to cut Lebanon’s advantage to only 8 points but center Norvel Pelle’s stonewall defense prevented the nationals to maintain their rhythm.

His war against drugs says it all.","body":"If you can bring yourself to believe Rodrigo Duterte – which is proving more and and more difficult to do because he’s proving himself more and more unstable – this nation has been condemned to poverty. Sixteen million Filipinos did in fact believe his promise to precisely deliver the nation from poverty, and in May last year gave him the decisive popular vote to lead it for the next 6 years. They believed his diagnosis of its elemental malaise – drugs – and they believed his prescription – kill. “Until all the drug dealers and addicts are dead,” he said, “we cannot move forward.” And so, as soon as he took office in July, he sent out his police to kill – for national redemption. Naturally, the poor, who have seen no improvement in their lot for generations, made up the majority of his supporters – they liked a quick-fix leadership, and had become so desperate they were prepared to forget that not very long ago (1972-1986) they had been set even further back under that precise sort of leadership, that of Ferdinand Marcos, an idol of Duterte’s, as it happened. Duterte did attract some following from the definitely not poor, but it’s difficult to tell why; apparently, not unlike an audience vicariously taken with perverse theater, some of them were charmed by his aberrant character, routinely manifest in a blustery language accentuated by sexist allusions and a favorite cuss phrase. Actually a not uncommon expression, that phrase is benign, meaningless, in its common utterance, but, in Duterte’s public speechmaking, it is crisply articulated and unmistakably aimed and ill-willed: it’s a phrase that debases mothers – the pope’s own mother once got it. In any case, Duterte’s well-heeled backers are well hedged against whatever costs his bizarre brand of presidency might bring, unlike the poor, who in fact have borne these costs. His war against drugs says it all. Thousands of lives have been lost in this war at the hands of either the police or, in a differentiation strictly demanded by the government, “vigilantes,” although if indeed operating on their own, these vigilantes could only have been inspired as well by Duterte’s exhortations. Scarcely any among these victims were drug producers or suppliers of any consequence; they were, rather, small fry, forced by the circumstances of poverty to use and peddle drugs, yet ending up dead none the richer for it.  Duterte first asked that his war be given 3 months, then asked for 3 months more, then asked for until the end of his first year, then for until the end of his term. Having predicated the first step toward national progress on the success of his war, he was saying to not expect to see that first step taken under his leadership. And, now, suddenly, at the end of his first year, he admits – although without the slightest hint of humility, as only may be expected of a clinically certified narcissist – that the job can’t be done in one presidential term. In other words, he can’t do it, but surely he prefers to be understood as being the only one who, given a longer term, can do it. He says he has finally identified the root problem – no, it’s not poverty; it’s elementary geography: an archipelago of 7,100 islands, the Philippines has a coastline too long to be patrolled against the smugglers who sneak in the drugs. How Duterte’s newly learned geography lesson informs his drug-war strategy he does not say, but I imagine the issue is complicated by diplomacy: the drugs come mostly from China, and he’s afraid to antagonize China.        In the meantime, he continues to fight his war, and fight it with greater intensity but with the same dubious purpose and strategy – kill all 4 million drug dealers and users and save the nation.  In merely 3 days of the week now ending, his war accounted for an average of around 25 kills a day, higher than ever. Elementary arithmetic could have shown him, too, that, at that rate under constant conditions, it will require more than 400 years to kill his 4 million and win his war. Conceivably, anyway, greater frenzy and, consequently, more indiscriminateness attend the intensified war. A scandalous case involved 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos, an 11th-grader from Caloocan City. Witnesses, their words validated by CCTV images, tell his story: Kian happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Out of curiosity, he picks up some stuff – supposedly drugs – disposed of on the run by someone eluding the police. The pursuers vent their frustration on Kian. They grab him, hand him a gun, order him to run and, as he obeys desperately, in tears, knowing for sure he’s running for his life, gun him down. Yet Duterte’s servile police chief could find it in himself to try to be cute: he says the people should be grateful to know that, as evidenced by all those thousands of corpses, the police don’t sleep on the job.

Nograles, who represents Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) in the House of Representatives, said Friday, August 18, he tried to use Grab to get to the airport. “To his disappointment, he was refused three times and at least two Grab drivers cancelled on him before one finally decided to take him,” according to a press release from his office. A regular Uber user, Nograles said he eventually cancelled the Grab ride and took a taxi instead. He was still charged by Grab P318 for the ride he did not take. “This to me is a clear case of passenger refusal, which is considered a violation by the LTFRB. They’ve been talking tough about imposing severe punishments against taxi drivers who refuse passengers, but what about those who do the same through our ride-hailing applications? Mas high-tech lang sa Grab, pero di ba pareho lang na passenger refusal ‘yan (Grab is just more high-tech, but isn’t that also passenger refusal)?” said the lawmaker in the statement. Ride-sharing or ride-hailing apps, such as Grab and Uber, have been in the spotlight recently after the LTFRB cracked down on these companies, particularly because they allowed unregistered drivers to use their platforms. The LTFRB recently suspended Uber for a month because the company did not comply with the regulatory agency’s order to stop accrediting and accepting new drivers. Users of the apps have been complaining about the surge in Grab ride prices following the suspension of Uber. Although the two platforms have the same end-goal – connecting a driver to a potential rider – their mechanisms differ. On Uber, for instance, drivers only know the drop-off point after they agree to pick up the passenger. Meanwhile, Grab drivers are informed of a passenger’s destination even before they agree to the trip. Nograles criticized Grab for “overcharging,” which he said “has gone out of control after LTFRB decided to suspend Uber.” “There are times when Grab would charge as much as P800 just for a 20-kilometer ride because of the surge. This is already hold-up. This is no different from a taxi driver who would demand an extra on top of their meter fare. I don’t know if LTFRB even knows this is considered as overcharging,” he said. He called for an “auto-cap” for fare surges. The LTFRB in December 2016 ordered both Grab and Uber to lessen the multipliers for their surge price to twice the fare, excluding the base fare. This was partly in response to the costly surge prices during the holiday season. Nograles said he would bring up the incidences of high surge prices and passenger refusal when the House committee on transport begins tackling bills that would provide legal framework for Grab and Uber to operate in the country. Grab earlier promised to limit to its surge pricing following Uber’s suspension. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/179158-ph-yap-vicencio-dela-cruz-bronze-sea-games-2017-archery/","title":"PH’s Yap, Vicencio, Dela Cruz grab bronze in SEA Games 2017 archery","date":"Aug 18, 2017 2:45 PM PHT","snippet":"Philippines is currently at 7th place with a silver and 2 bronzes in the 29th Southeast Asian Games","body":"   MANILA, Philippines – The dynamic trio of Earl Benjamin Yap, Joseph Benjamin Vicencio and Paul Marton Dela Cruz bagged the bronze medal in the 29th Southeast Asian Games team compound archery tournament at the KL Sports City, Malaysia.

Kazakhstan cruised to an 8-2 lead to start the 4th set, but the Philippines once again came from behind to stun their foes and equalize the match at two sets apiece. The seasoned Kazakhs, however, got huge momentum back in the decider as they hopped on a quick 10-1 run to fend off the Philippines’ late game rally and salvage 7th place. Jaja Santiago paced the national team with 18 points on 14 attacks and 3 blocks. Alyssa Valdez and Jovelyn Gonzaga joined her in double digits with 11 and 10, respectively, while Ces Molina had 7. Yekaterina Zhdanova produced a game-high 24 markers on 19 spikes and 5 block shots for Kazakhstan. Katerina Tatko added 15, while Radmila Beresneva and Alla Bogdashkina both pitched in 14. Despite failing to advance further in the semifinals, the Philippine team has already surpassed its 12th place finish back in the 2015 edition of the Asian Seniors, while qualifying for the Asian Volleyball Cup in 2018, a first for the country. The country also finished 12th in the same tourney when it was played 4 years ago in Thailand. With the two teams locked in for 7th and 8th place, the remaining bottom squads Vietnam and Chinese Taipei will face-off in the next match of the day for a chance to seal the 5th seed.

The Philippine team held its own offensively in the opening set as it provided a show against the defending Southeast Asian (SEA) Games champs. The Filipina spikers briefly got a taste of lead, 17-16, before Thailand sparked a run in clutch time to fend off the gritty PH. It was all Thailand in the second set, however, as the powerhouse squad displayed dominance on both ends of the floor.

The 78th-ranked Dane birdied 3 of the last 5 holes to fire a four-under-par 67 at Quail Hollow, one stroke ahead of US Open winner Brooks Koepka and his fellow Americans Gary Woodland and Grayson Murray. “I just felt like I was playing nicely,” Olesen said. “The first 15 holes I played really well. I putted very nice.” World number two Spieth, who won his third major title at last month’s British Open, struggled with his putter in firing a 72. At 24, he would become the youngest on the career Slam list by winning the Wanamaker Trophy this week. “Tee to green it was pretty solid,” Spieth said. “On the green was the problem. My speed and lines were a little off.” Spieth, who also won the 2015 Masters and US Open, can become only the sixth man to sweep the four current major titles in a career after Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen. Koepka, who captured his first major title in June at Erin Hills, had 5 birdies and two bogeys, the last at 16 to fall back. He has again peaked at the right time, he said. “These are the events where you want to play your best,” Koepka said of majors. “Sometimes it’s a lot simpler than people think. It just comes down to preparation.” World number one Dustin Johnson, in a pack on 70 that included Australia’s Jason Day and Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama, said putting was as tough as he has seen all season. “It was tough to get the ball close to the hole,” he said. “I’m very pleased with that the way the course played.” Olesen, 27, seeks his first major title. His most recent of four career European Tour victories came at last year’s Turkish Airlines Open. But he is fighting to keep the excitement and pressure well managed. Olesen sank a seven-foot birdie putt at the second, missed the green and made bogey at the par-3 sixth, then birdied the par-5 seventh by two-putting from 60 feet and the par-4 eighth on a 15-footer from the fringe. He birdied the 14th from 12 feet and the par-5 15th after chipping to three feet, then missed the green and took bogey at the par-3 17th only to seize the solo lead with his longest putt of the day. ‘A little disappointing’ Spieth, who began on the back nine, birdied the par-5 15th but found a greenside bunker at 16 and missed a 14-foot par putt, then missed 10-foot par putts at the first fifth and par-3 sixth holes. Spieth answered with birdies from three feet at the par-5 seventh and inches from the cup at the par-4 eighth. “It was a day that should have been a couple under par and ended one-over,” Spieth said. “It’s a little disappointing but I brought it back with a couple birdies to at least having a chance going forward.” Spieth was in the early feature group with Koepka and the year’s other major winner, Spain’s Sergio Garcia, the Masters champion. Murray, a home-state hopeful who struck the opening shot at the year’s last major tournament, birdied 3 of the last 6 holes. “I’ve got to keep putting myself in position to make gains,” Murray said. “You can’t miss the fairways.” ‘A good turnaround’ Day, who had 4 bogeys in the first 12 holes, rallied with two birdies and an eagle in the last 5 to finish on 70. “It was a good turnaround,” Day said. “It’s challenging tee to green but on the greens it’s very hard and very fast. If you don’t get yourself in position it’s hard to make par.” Among afternoon starters, fourth-ranked Rory McIlroy was level par after four holes and South Korean An Byeong-Hun was three-under through five after opening on the back nine with 3 consecutive birdies. Northern Ireland’s McIlroy, 28, could become only the third player to win 5 majors before turning 30, joining Nicklaus and Woods. He has two PGA titles and two wins at Quail Hollow in US PGA events. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/177507-senate-hearing-ltfrb-grab-uber-taxi-passenger-bill-of-rights/","title":"LIVE: Senate hearing on LTFRB issues vs Grab, Uber and Taxi Passenger Bill of Rights","date":"Aug 4, 2017 8:48 AM PHT","snippet":"Watch the hearing live on Rappler on Thursday, August 3","body":" Bookmark this page to watch the Senate hearing live on Thursday, August 3 MANILA, Philippines – The Senate public services committee will hold a hearing on the issues hounding ride-hailing companies Grab and Uber, as well as the proposed Taxi Passenger Bill of Rights, on Thursday, August 3.

DOTr Assistant Secretary for commuter affairs Elvira Medina raised the issue on Thursday, August 3, in a Senate public services committee hearing. “For the past weeks, the LTFRB had been bashed, they had been maligned. But my question is did any of the two, or any of these TNCs hire agencies using minions and all the other to bash the LTFRB?” Medina asked. However, she was not given the chance to continue her questioning, as Senate committee chair Grace Poe called her out. Poe said it is not wrong for either parties to hire public relations companies in a free market. “Ma’am I think we’re going off topic. I understand what you’re saying. Madaming trolls. Madaming fake news. (There are a lot of trolls. There’s a lot of fake news) That’s the free market. That’s the sad or happy reality. They will get their PR firm. No one’s stopping the LTFRB from getting their own advocates to speak out and that’s fine. No idea will last anyway if it’s untrue,” Poe said. The senator pointed out there must be a bulk of Filipinos who “enjoy” the convenience of TNCs and TNVs. “Obviously, there’s a following and there are people who are agreeing because they absolutely enjoy the service. Otherwise kung propaganda, sandali lang yan (if it’s propaganda, it won’t last). They can spend millions and it will not take off. For sure meron silang (they have) PR, lets just agree on that,” Poe said. Poe, also the public information committee chair, said she would not even try to regulate it. “No, I’m not going to regulate that.

Lawyer Bong Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA), told senators that this practice is no different from Uber and Grab’s surge pricing, or the increase in fares based on demand during peak hours. “[Grab and Uber] are trying to incentivize drivers para kapag traffic, may high demand, pupunta ang auto sa pasahero. Because if they don’t do it, hindi susunduin ng mga sasakyan nila ‘yung mga pasahero,” Suntay said during a Senate public services committee hearing on Thursday. (Grab and Uber are trying to incentivize drivers so that during heavy traffic and there’s high demand, they would agree to pick up passengers. Because if they don’t do it, the drivers won’t pick up the passengers.) Suntay explained that some taxi drivers ask for additional payment due to insufficient income or losses incurred in traveling to far or congested areas. “May taxi driver na magsasabi, ‘Puwede ba padagdag ng P50 sa metro?’ Dahil alam ‘nyo ho, pagka ang pasahero magpapahatid sa lugar na matraffic, malulugi ‘yung driver,” he said. (There’s a taxi driver who will say: “Can you add P50 to the metered fare?” Because you know, if a passenger wants to be brought to a congested area, the driver would incur losses.) “If a taxi driver gets stuck in traffic for an hour, the meter would only earn him P75 because our waiting time is P3.50 for every two minutes. A driver who pays a boundary of P1,200 [a day] would need P60 an hour just to make the boundary. This is the reason why taxi drivers ay tumatanggi na maghatid (decline to get passengers),” he added. Suntay also said he is not “justifying” the act, which has exasperated commuters and prompted them to switch to transport network companies (TNCs) like Uber and Grab. “I’m not justifying it. I’m just saying the real reason why it’s done,” he said. Suntay added that the lack of income leads to the negative behavior of drivers. “As with any normal person, income has a direct connection to individual behavior and action. Kapag walang pera, mas bugnutin ka, mas mabilis kang mainis. Kapag maliit ang kita mo, naghahanap ka ng paraan to augment it (If you don’t have money, you’re more irritable, you’re easily annoyed. If you have limited income, you find ways to augment it),” he said.

During the House committee hearing on the registration and franchising or lack thereof of the two companies, Uber said it has more than 66,000 “partners who have taken at least one trip in the past year.” Out of that number, only over 2,500 have either a provisional authority (PA) permit or a certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise, which allows them to ply the streets of Metro Manila. Grab, meanwhile, has more than 52,000 vehicles accredited with only 3,000 to 4,000 of those vehicles possessing either PAs or CPCs from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “We are shocked, to say the least,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said, after the two companies stated the figures. Delgra said up until today, the number of vehicles registered under Grab and Uber had been unclear even to them. Grab and Uber, ride-hailing firms which provide an online platform for car owners and drivers to connect with passengers, has been at odds with the LTFRB as thousands of drivers operate without permits or with expired permits. Several lawmakers have filed bills before the House of Representatives to define, classify, and regulate companies like Grab and Uber. “Come to Congress, get your franchise, and don’t fight with LTFRB,” said AKO Bicol Representative Rodel Batocabe, author of a bill that would regulate TNCs. Batocabe lost his nephew to a car crash involving an Uber vehicle in Singapore last month. Lawmakers also quipped that it was no wonder traffic in Metro Manila has gotten worse, given the sheer number of TNC vehicles on the road.    Both Uber and Grab, however, clarified that not all of the vehicles registered in their networks ply Metro Manila at the same time. Some “partners” are registered with both companies. Not all drivers are full-time either, meaning they only drive their vehicles for a few hours a day at most. Bong Suntay of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) said they are fine with operating alongside Uber and Grab so long as these ride-hailing services “are regulated just like [taxis].” “The requirements are almost the same.

After years of clamoring for a full ironman to be held here in the Philippines, the Sunrise Events Inc (SEI) finally relented to organize one for its 10th year anniversary next year. SEI opened the registration today online and also set-up an online registration station at the New World Makati Hotel wherein some 250 people showed up to register for the event. “It was a gathering of athletes to register together, to make a commitment to join the Century Tuna Ironman Philippines on June 3, 2018,” SEI general manager Princess Galura explained. Those interested still have a chance to join the race as there are still about 100 slots up for grabs not only for Filipino participants but also for those athletes coming from other countries. Galura said that registration will be open until the 1,000 slots run out. She added that they have decided to limit the participants to only a thousand because they wanted to be able to provide a special experience to each of the participants. The 1,000 participants will not include the professional triathletes who will be taking part in the event. According to the SEI general manager, they still do not know how many of the pros will be competing. Galura also explained that they decided to hold it in Subic because it will be easier to hold the 180-kilometer bike leg of the race via the Subic-Clark Tarlac Expressway. Participants will have to conquer a 3.8-kilometer ocean swim at the Triboa Bay, take the 180-kilometer bike ride at the SCTEX in two loops and end the race with a 42.2-kilometer run on the road offering the best views of Subic Bay also in two loops. The lung-busting race will only have one category — the individual, wherein the participant could either be in the pros division or the age-group divisions. The race will not have a relay category. Galura said it is the best chance for Filipinos to become an ironman on their home soil while they are being cheered by their family and friends.  “They can bring their whole family in Subic and it will be cheaper,” added Galura. With 100 slots still floating, interested participants can avail of the early registration fee of US$650 until August 30, 2017. The normal rate of US$700 will be applied from September 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018 while US$800 will be charged to a late registrant from March 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018 should slots remain available in those periods.

It is best to ride and confront change, not resist it.","body":"A disservice to all.  This is what the government, through the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), is doing in its wish to impose its authority and medieval mindset on Grab and Uber. Its pronouncements on the app-based riding services have confused more than clarify, raised questions more than answer them, and agitated more than serve thousands of already harried urban commuters. The mess began when the LTFRB threatened to apprehend all Grab and Uber drivers by July 26, 2017, if they remained without permits or provisional authorities. It also ordered the two companies to pay the fine of P5 million each, which they eventually did. This came a year after the agency did the correct thing, which was to suspend the issuance of such permits after these transport network vehicle services (TNVs) deployed drivers beyond the number they were allowed. The LTFRB promised at the time to draft new regulations, which it has so far failed to do. Worse, it lost the companies’ accreditation papers. Now it’s saying perhaps these drivers should have minimum working hours. Or that government should tax them.   The revived crackdown smacks of bad faith on one hand – are well-entrenched taxi operators in control of LTFRB? – and incompetence on the other, given the agency’s short-sighted and wish-washy approach to a modern-world management problem. (READ: What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) To be sure, app-enabled transport services are not beyond criticism or abuse. In America, Europe, and Asia, governments and established taxi operators have risen up in arms over the way technology has allowed public-interest companies to escape regulation and basic standards.  The disruption at some point prompted some governments to recommend banning Uber, an idea that’s akin to controlling news distribution online.  Yet, it cannot be denied that Uber and Grab serve commuter needs; they’re efficient and can be tracked – both in how much they’re paid or where they travel. In the Philippines, they fill a void left by a perennially weak mass transport system. So why fix what isn’t broken? Technology should serve to motivate us to do things better. Taxi operators, for example, can band together for their own app or 3rd-party channels. Instead of spanking tech-savvy drivers, the LTFRB should help drivers and companies upgrade skills and use technology to improve services, strengthen safety for commuters, and connect with each other to discuss welfare issues, such as better pay and insurance. The data collected over the years by Grab and Uber can also help government better understand consumer behavior – as well as the unaddressed weaknesses of the transport industry. Singapore has started doing this.

What exactly are the requirements for these permits?","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Regulatory Franchising Board (LTFRB) recently raised issues against Grab and Uber drivers over franchising permit violations. What does the LTFRB need from these transportation giants? It all started in July 2016, when the LTFRB, through Memorandum Circular No. 2016-008, suspended the acceptance of new applications for transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) permits of transportation network companies (TNC) like Uber and Grab. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) said the circular was issued due to the rising volume of TNVS applications and the government review of the fare scheme. On July 23, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) released a statement on its Facebook page and cited issues of “accountability of TNCs to passengers and operators alike, and the problem of fare surging scheme.” “Equally important issues for compliance is to make sure that TNCs and TNVS contribute their fair share of taxes to the government, and for TNVS to have the required garages to avoid illegal parking on streets to prevent traffic congestion,” the DOTr said. TNVS permits are legal papers given to accredited TNCs. These are the qualifications for aspiring TNVS applicants prior to the moratorium:   LTFRB gives two kinds of permits to TNVS drivers: the provisional authority (PA) permit valid for 45 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise valid for one to two years. (READ: LTFRB fines Grab, Uber P5M each for permit violations) The requirements for a CPC permit are as follows: New Certificate of Public Convenience by Kimiko Sy on Scribd   A CPC permit usually takes more time to process. While waiting for the CPC permit, LTFRB gives out a PA permit which is processed just for 7 to 10 days. Here is the cost for filing permits: Filing for a motion to get a PA permit requires a motion for extension of provisional authority to be executed by a lawyer, OR/CR from LTO Registration, receiving copy of the application for CPC, government-issued ID, special power of attorney (for a representative), and the receipt of the payment for motion. No more permits Since the suspension last year, LTFRB has not processed a single application for TNVS permits. However, Grab and Uber have admitted that 80% of their drivers are driving without either a provisional authority (PA) permits or a certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise. Those whose status have been held following last year’s suspension order can continue to file for PA permits until their CPCs are released.  The LTFRB’s latest estimate is that of the 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers,15,400 at most have adequate papers to operate. Discussions of Grab and Uber’s suspensions raised numerous complaints from commuters, especially those taking metered taxis. (READ: #CommuterWatch: ‘Choosy’ taxi drivers and other transport woes) The suspension dilemma is also heavily reflected on 50,000 Grab and Uber drivers operating around the country. “Hindi ko naman po alam na kailangan naming kumuha ng ganoon sa LTFRB kasi hindi malinaw ang instructions nila sa amin, ang hirap po kasi lahat kami mawawalan ng trabaho,” said Grab driver Dodie Cabatu. (I didn’t know that we had to get [those forms] from the LTFRB because their instructions weren’t clear to us. It’s hard because a lot of us will lose our jobs [because of this]).” Grab and Uber have filed separate motions for reconsideration. Pending the LTFRB decision on the MRs, the TNCs’ undocumented drivers can continue their services. The LTFRB has also ordered the Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered with the TNCs after June 30 this year. – with reports from Hannah Mallorca/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/176933-you-need-to-know-fuss-grab-uber-ltfrb-regulation-explainer/","title":"What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?","date":"Jul 28, 2017 9:26 AM PHT","snippet":"What's happening between the LTFRB and ride-hailing services? Here's a rundown of the ongoing controversy","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Over the past couple of days, Filipino commuters took to social media to express their anger and frustration over reports that the operations of Grab and Uber may be adversely affected following a government regulatory body’s crackdown on unregistered drivers using the ride-hailing platforms. The issue sparked fierce debate on both sides – with commuters saying Grab and Uber are essential to metro life and much more reliable than ordinary taxis, while the government insists that these need to be regulated to ensure accountability. What’s the issue about? Here’s a rundown of the ongoing controversy. Who are involved? Ride-hailing services Grab and Uber are considered Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), based on new transport categories created by the government back in May 2015.  Vehicles under Grab, Uber, and other similar ride-sharing services are considered part of the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS). The TNVS covers vehicles that provide pre-arranged transportation services for compensation. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) approved Grab and Uber as TNCs in July 2015 and August 2015, respectively.  The TNCs are required to screen and accredit their drivers and register them with the LTFRB. The LTFRB, meanwhile, is in charge of issuing permits to TNVS drivers: the provisional authority (PA), or a temporary permit valid for 45 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise, which is valid for a year.  What’s the problem? On July 21, 2016, the LTFRB released Memorandum Circular 2016-008, which suspends the acceptance and processing of applications for Uber, Grab, and other ride-sharing services.  The order essentially stopped the release of temporary permits to Grab and Uber vehicles while the LTFRB further studied how to regulate the growing industry. On July 11, 2017 the LTFRB ordered Grab and Uber to pay a fine of P5 million each for letting drivers with no permits or expired permits to still operate on their platforms. Grab and Uber admitted that they accepted new drivers despite the LTFRB’s earlier order, citing strong passenger demand. Both companies said about 80% of their active drivers don’t have a PA or CPC franchise. But some Grab and Uber drivers say it’s not their fault they are considered “colorum.” They point to the LTFRB’s earlier order stopping the processing of TNVS applications. They also claimed that some 7,000 drivers who were already accredited did not get their PAs renewed last year. Because of this, many drivers had expired PAs by the end of 2016.  Aside from the hefty fine, the LTFRB also ordered Grab and Uber to clear out unregistered drivers by July 26 or face more fines.  But Grab and Uber filed separate motions for reconsideration. The LTFRB later agreed not to apprehend unregistered TNVS until it decides on the appeal. While this came as a relief to Grab and Uber users and drivers, this decision did not sit well with operators of taxis, jeeps, and vans: they slammed what they called the LTFRB’s preferential treatment, saying they too should be spared from apprehension while waiting for the approval of their franchise applications.  What’s the LTFRB’s position? For the LTFRB, the problem began with Grab and Uber. LTFRB chief Martin Delgra III said the TNCs may have deliberately withheld telling their “partner drivers” to come to the LTFRB to get a franchise before operating. And despite public outrage on social media, the LTFRB said it’s standing firm on its position, saying the TNCs should explain to their peer operators why they were allowed to operate on the platform even without the proper permits. LTFRB spokesperson Aileen Lizada also said that Uber and Grab trips represent a “minority” in the total number of trips in Metro Manila – they account for only 2% of the 21.5 million trips per day recorded in 2015. But despite this, the LTFRB also acknowledged that the riding public will be harmed if it simply cancels the accreditation of the TNCs. Adding to the controversy were statements made by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, who said that the government should have a share from the income of Grab and Uber. The LTFRB later clarified that Tugade was referring to the unregistered vehicles.  Stoking more reactions was LTFRB’s admission that it lost the accreditation papers of Grab and Uber. The two companies’ accreditations are still pending renewal. Grab’s accreditation expired last July 3, and Uber’s is set to expire in August.    How did the public react? With the LTFRB’s crackdown on unregistered Uber and Grab vehicles, an estimated 15,000 drivers at most can remain on the road, out of the estimated 56,000 drivers. Both Grab and Uber are seeking the support of their users, launching online campaigns. On Twitter, the hashtag #WeWantGrabUber trended as commuters expressed their anger and frustration. Citing bad experiences with taxis, some netizens say Grab and Uber remain the safest way for them to commute. (READ: Cracking down on Uber and Grab will hurt commuters, not protect them)  Even the former LTFRB chief chimed in to say that the new government should listen to actual users of these ride-sharing services.   But some backed the government’s move, citing the need for accountability. During a House hearing, one lawmaker asked whether TNCs can be held accountable if a crash happens involving one of their vehicles.  Others also questioned the surge pricing system that they say needs to be further regulated.  Still, some questioned the very model of Uber and Grab. While its original idea was ride-sharing – those going a certain way can pick up co-passengers heading in the same direction – it quickly became a way to make profit, with some operating them similar to a taxi fleet. (READ: Let us go beyond #WeWantUberGrab)  Because of this, some point to TNVS units as just an addition to traffic, a position the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chief also takes. What’s next? As of Wednesday, July 26, the LTFRB ordered all Grab and Uber drivers who registered with the service after June 30, 2017 to be deactivated.   Grab stopped activating new drivers on July 17, while Uber stopped on July 18. The regulatory agency also said it’s considering setting minimum working hours for Grab and Uber drivers. The LTFRB is continuing meetings with the TNCs. The regulatory agency also plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/176936-thewrap-july-27-2017-evening-edition/","title":"Grab and Uber, Aguirre, PCGG | Evening wRap","date":"Jul 27, 2017 7:52 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"Today on Rappler: The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board says it is ‘seriously considering’ setting “minimum” working hours for Grab and Uber drivers. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre conducts a surprise inspection of the New Bilibid Prison. Malacanang says proposals to abolish the Philippine Commission on Good Government is driven by the need to streamline government, not politics. Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella claims the European Union and the Commission on Human Rights were invited to President Rodrigo Duterte’s State of the Nation Address. United States President Donald Trump announces that transgender people may not serve ‘in any capacity’ in the U.S. military.   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/176882-thewrap-july-27-2017-midday-edition/","title":"Grab and Uber, Gorio, Trump | Midday wRap","date":"Jul 27, 2017 1:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the midday newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"Today on Rappler: The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board orders Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered with the ride-hailing companies after June 30. State weather bureau PAGASA says Tropical Storm Gorio has slowed down but maintained its strength. United States President Donald Trump announces that transgender people may not serve ‘in any capacity’ in the U.S. military.

In a press briefing, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said the LTFRB qualifies transport network vehicle service (TNVS) providers as “public service” so they should observe a minimum number of hours on the road – just like government workers – to fulfill that duty. “So if ever we will grant franchises, [there should be a] minimum number of hours na dapat online kayo. Kasi kung bibigyan kayo ng prangkisa, pero two hours a week lang kayo babiyahe, sayang. Bibigay na lang natin sa iba ‘yung prangkisa,” Lizada said. (So if we will grant franchises, [there should be a] minimum number of hours that they need to be online. Because if we will give franchises, but they will only work for two hours a week, it would be a waste. It would be better to give the franchise to other operators.) The board member said the measure will help regulate the drivers of TNVS operators, as there are currently 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers plying the roads. Imposing minimum working hours, Lizada said, would also respond to a recently-revealed practice of Grab and Uber drivers who only go on the road “when surge prices are high.” Currently, Grab classifies drivers as part-time if they stay on the roads below 40 hours a week, and full-time if they clock higher hours. Uber, for its part, classifies drivers as “casual drivers” if they operate below 10 hours, part-time if below 40, and full-time if above 40. The LTFRB bared the plan a day after its second technical working group meeting with Grab and Uber on Wednesday, July 26. On Wednesday, the agency announced that it ordered the deactivation of drivers who registered with Grab and Uber after June 30, 2017. Lizada said they hope to be done with the meetings by September 2017, and produce memorandum circulars to fix the regulation deadlock. After that, the LTFRB plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services. There are bills filed in both houses of Congress seeking to regulate TNVS providers. The transport network companies had earlier filed motions for reconsideration to delay the implementation of the LTFRB’s order issued last July 7, which instructed both TNCs to purge drivers without adequate documents. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176800-ltfrb-deactivate-grab-uber-drivers-registered-after-june-30/","title":"LTFRB orders Grab, Uber to deactivate drivers registered after June 30","date":"Jul 26, 2017 10:37 PM PHT","snippet":"LTFRB reiterates its order for Uber to submit its master list of drivers, as the agency has only received Grab's","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Drivers who registered with Grab and Uber after June 30, 2017, should be deactivated, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered on Wednesday, July 26. This order came after both transport network companies filed motions for reconsideration (MRs) to delay the implementation of the LTFRB’s July 11, 2017, order, which instructed both TNCs to purge drivers without adequate documents. LTFRB officials and representatives of Uber and Grab were still in a meeting as of posting late Wednesday night. “The Board acknowledges receipt of the payment of fine in the amount of Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000) from each Respondent as contained in the Board’s Consolidated Order dated 11 July 2017 has been fully complied with,” the July 26 order read. “[The] subsequent filing by the Respondents of the [MRs] have the effect of staying the execution of the other directives contained in the 11 July 2017 Consolidated Order only for those Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) existing in their systems as of 30 June 2017.” The LTFRB has issued 3 orders in relation to Grab and Uber operations: The MRs filed by the companies will still halt the implementation of the July 11 order, but only for drivers registered as of June 30. Grab stopped activating new drivers only on July 17, while Uber stopped on July 18. The LTFRB reiterated to Grab and Uber its demand for the companies to provide a master list of all their drivers as of June 30, 2017. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said they have only received Grab’s. Uber communications head Cat Avelino said they will submit theirs on Thursday, July 27.

(PUVs need to show the public that they can also provide good service… What happened with the [transport network vehicle service] operators, they became the symbol of good service, but we all have the potential for good service, we just need to show it.) Orbos was addressing PUV transport groups in a consultation, telling them that their services can improve in simple ways. (READ: Taxi, jeep, van operators call out LTFRB for ‘unfair treatment’) He recommended that jeepney drivers keep their aisle lights on at night, and avoid wearing sleeveless shirts and shorts while working. For bus drivers, he said they should only pick up passengers from designated areas. “Napakaliit ho na bagay iyon pero kung naipatupad ninyo ‘yun makikita ng mamamayan kung ano ba talaga ang serbisyo na gusto ‘nyong ibigay sa kanila,” added Orbos. (They’re small gestures but if you can do them, people will see what service you want to give them.) Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) board member Aileen Lizada seconded Orbos’ recommendation. Lizada told PUV operators that the public’s support for Grab and Uber should be taken as a “wake-up call,” especially because jeepneys, buses, and taxis serve the majority of the riding public. Taxi driver-operators, said Lizada, should know how to navigate, keep their cars presentable at all times, and agree to take passengers to wherever their destination is. “‘Yung mga gano’n dapat sabihan ‘nyo rin ‘yung ibang taxi drivers na ‘pag ginawa nila ‘yun (mistakes), apektado ang buong taxi denomination,” she added. (You should inform other taxi drivers, because if they [commit mistakes], the whole taxi denomination will be affected.) In line with their advice, Orbos urged the transport leaders to be open to the Department of Transportation’s PUV Modernization Program, which includes the phaseout of old vehicles and revision of transport routes. “Ito po ay pagkakataon na i-modernize (This is an opportunity to modernize your fleet)… Why don’t you take it upon yourselves?” he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176782-grab-uber-riders-minority-ltfrb/","title":"Grab, Uber riders only a minority – LTFRB","date":"Jul 26, 2017 1:46 PM PHT","snippet":"'Sila lang ho 'yung maingay sa social media, [but] definitely government will not budge, we will not be allowed or influenced because of social media,' LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada says","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab and Uber riders constitute only a minority of the commuting public, but they’re just noisier on social media.

His stand: “Kung ‘colorum’ ka, dapat wala ka sa lansangan (If you’re colorum, you shouldn’t be on the road),” Lim said on Tuesday, July 25. According to him, traffic volume in the metro’s roads has been the MMDA’s problem for the longest time, and keeping thousands of unregistered Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) drivers does not help. “Last year, 417,000 cars were sold. The projection this year won’t be less than 450,000. Let’s say 30% of those cars are in Metro Manila. But the capacity of EDSA is not expanding,” Lim said in a mix of English and Filipino. Of Grab and Uber’s 42,000 drivers, the LTFRB estimates only 15,400 have the necessary permits to operate. The number of unregistered drivers ballooned over the past year as the LTFRB imposed a moratorium barring new drivers from getting temporary permits to operate while they wait for their certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise. Earlier, the LTFRB ordered unregistered drivers off the streets by July 26, but Grab and Uber filed motions for reconsideration allowing them to operate further.

This was the question that grieving lawmaker AKO BICOL Representative Rodel Batocabe posed to TNCs and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Tuesday, July 25, during the hearing of the House committee on Metro Manila. The committee hearing comes after the LTFRB encountered a regulation deadlock with the TNCs, as the LTFRB attempted to put a cap on the number of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) cars in the metro. “Two weeks ago, namatay ang pamangkin ko sa Singapore, Uber. Yung driver hindi namatay, pero pamangkin ko namatay in Singapore…Let’s say dito sa Pilipinas nangyari ‘yun, sinong idedemanda ko?” Batocabe asked. (Two weeks ago, my nephew died in Singapore [while riding] Uber. The driver didn’t die, but my nephew did. Let’s say it happened in the Philippines. Who do I sue?) LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III pointed Batocabe to Memorandum Circular (MC) 2015-015, which says that the driver, not the TNC, will be liable. “The TNC shall be liable for failure to exercise due diligence and reasonable care, except if such non-compliance is due to acts or omissions outside of the TNC’s control. However, such liability shall not extend to actions of drivers, who are independent contractors who provide the transportation services directly to passengers,” the MC read. But for Batocabe, the TNCs should also take a part of the blame since they also accredit their drivers as their “partners.” “They can’t just operate with apps and everything without any regulation especially when it involves public utilities and public service [and when] it involves our people,” Batocabe said.  Batocabe recommended that the LTFRB issue a “remedial order” to reinforce their last MC increasing the accountability of the TNCs. Passenger insurance In their defense, representatives from Grab and Uber said that all rides booked through their applications are insured by the Passenger Accident Management and Insurance Agency, setting insurance as high as P200,000 per passenger in case something untoward happens. They also said that they actively reach out to passengers when they get into trouble in their trips. Uber government relations chief Yves Gonzalez added that passengers can file a case against Uber if they find fault committed by the company itself. Meanwhile, the LTFRB chairman said he will raise Batocabe’s concern in the board’s technical working group meetings with Grab and Uber in the coming weeks. Grab and Uber were recently fined P5 million each for allowing their drivers to work in Metro Manila despite their lack of permits. In its July 11 order, the LTFRB directed the TNCs to purge themselves of drivers with expired or no permits by July 26. But Grab and Uber have filed separate motions for reconsideration.

They showed invaluable support for our community that allowed an entire industry to get back on our feet.  As an official update, Grab has filed a Motion for Reconsideration last July 20. The motion calls for the LTFRB to set aside the July 11 Consolidated Order to cease operations of TNVS units without franchise by July 26.The LTFRB will now need to review the issue of colorum and this suspends the effectivity of the Order. We assure you that no final decision has been made and this means that there will be no apprehensions, and Grab will not deactivate any units without PAs.  While we work with the LTFRB on this from our end, please do continue outserving and providing safe and reliable rides to our passengers.  Let us be hopeful that our collective efforts will lead to a long-term collaboration between our community and our regulators. We, along with more than 120,000 people who signed your petition, are standing with you and the families that you work hard to support.  Thank you Ka-Grab. Grab ON!

They appealed to the LTFRB to lift its July 21, 2016, order, which bars TNVS applicants from getting provisional authority permits (PAs) from the agency. Without PAs, new drivers waiting for the processing of their TNVS franchises cannot ply the roads. Citing “public demand,” however, Grab and Uber continued to accept new drivers and let them ply the metro’s roads even with expired or without PAs.  Of 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers, 26,600 have expired or no permits. The LTFRB issued a July 11, 2017, order, slapping both transport network companies (TNCs) a P5-million fine each, and marked July 26 – Wednesday next week – as the start of apprehension of drivers without proper documents. Grab and Uber put the apprehension day on hold as they filed motions for reconsideration of the July 11 order. However, the order which put the PA moratorium remained in effect. In their defense, the drivers accredited only by TNCs and not by LTFRB said they also underwent screening in obtaining their accreditation. “After undergoing stringent screening, training, and drug tests, we received our accreditation from our [TNCs]…. Even though many in our ranks do not yet have a PA, it is hard to consider us as fly-by-night ‘colorum’ drivers. Remember we underwent screening, training, NBI clearance, and drug tests,” their statement said. Receiving their petition, DOTr Undersecretary for Roads Thomas Orbos said he cannot assure them anything but their “best effort” to resolve the regulation deadlock. He said he will push for their inclusion in the upcoming technical working group talks, where so far only the LTFRB, Grab, and Uber representatives are included. “I will take it up with the LTFRB. They (drivers) are stakeholders. So, definitely. I am not saying anything, that’s a decision that [the LTFRB needs] to make, but definitely they need to be heard,” Orbos said. The group initially gathered signatures manually but later put the petition online where it got overwhelming support from users of the ride-hailing applications. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176273-ltfrb-lost-grab-uber-accreditation-papers/","title":"LTFRB lost Grab, Uber accreditation papers","date":"Jul 21, 2017 2:05 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED)The LTRFB board under the Duterte administration has been looking for the documents since it assumed office, says board member Aileen Lizada","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has (LTFRB) lost the accreditation papers of Grab and Uber, board member Aileen Lizada said on Friday, July 21.

After they are approved, the OED no longer has any reason to keep the documents. They are passed on to the Board already for their signature,” Cabrera said. Former LTFRB board member Ariel Inton, for his part, said the supposed loss of the documents is both unlikely and easy to remedy. Inton said former LTFRB legal counsel Robert Peig worked with the current board during the members’ “first few months” in office, so they can ask for his help. He added that the LTFRB can ask Grab and Uber for new copies of the accreditation requirements if necessary. Grab’s accreditation expired on July 3 while Uber’s is set to expire by August. They have been sought for comment regarding the accreditation documents but have not replied as of posting. Lizada spoke up about the supposed missing accreditation papers days after the LTFRB reportedly reached a “compromise” with Grab and Uber on the LTFRB’s July 11 order that it would begin apprehending their colorum drivers starting July 26. This was achieved in a meeting initiated by several senators. The TNCs have appealed the order.

The secretary’s statement was met with online rage from regular Grab and Uber riders. “Ang punto ni Secretary Tugade at ng LTFRB, kapag colorum ang isang sasakyan, walang habol d’yan ang gobyerno. Paano mo masisingil ng tamang tax kung hindi nga sila rehistrado?” Delgra said in a press statement on Thursday.

How can you charge taxes if they are not registered?) “Like any business, TNCs and their partners are covered by laws of taxation and they must give what’s due to the government,” Delgra added. However, the LTFRB cannot collect taxes anytime soon. Their hands are tied since they had given Grab and Uber until July 26 before apprehending some 26,600 colorum drivers, whose numbers have increased since 2016. Delaying the apprehension further, the transport network companies both filed motions for reconsideration against the LTFRB’s order.

Grab lawyer John Paul Nabua said they argued in their MR that the LTFRB did not inform them when it would lift the moratorium on accepting new driver applicants.

In a Facebook post on Tuesday, July 18, where Ginez recounted his time regulating the application-based transport services, he said: “Let the voices of TNVS (transport network vehicle services) users be heard.” Ginez was the head of the LTFRB when ride-hailing firms like Uber and Grab were rising in the country. He said they encountered “vociferous objections” from taxi operators back then, prompting them to issue memorandum circulars to regulate the TNVS. The Philippines became the first country to regulate app-based transport services. (READ: Taxis beware: Gov’t introduces 4 new transport categories) The LTFRB on July 21, 2016, under the Duterte administration, stopped new drivers from applying for provisional authority (PA) permits. Thousands of Uber and Grab drivers operated even without permits, however, so the LTFRB imposed a P5-million fine and set a July 26 deadline for “colorum” drivers to stop operating. What users say Out of 56,000 drivers estimated by the LTFRB, only 15,000 at most can remain on the road starting July 26. With majority of Uber and Grab drivers affected, TNVS users have been coming to their defense. Commuters have taken to social media to express anger and frustration, with #WeWantGrabUber trending on Twitter for two straight days already. Users also backed the petition started by Bobby Coronel, president of the Uber and Grab drivers’ group, which is asking the LTFRB to begin processing new PA applications. (READ: Grab, Uber drivers ask LTFRB to lift ban on new driver applications) So far, the petition has gotten more than 100,000 signatures, accompanied by testimonials. A certain Rosalie Lim from Quezon City said: ” I’m signing because Grab/Uber is the safest way for me to [commute]. They gave us comfort and assurance [compared] to [taxis]. I had [so] many bad [experiences] riding [taxis]… if possible do a survey because most of the riders like me now prefer to ride [with] the comfort and safety of Grab/Uber.” LTFRB to listen LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III gave an assurance that they would consider the concerns of all commuters – not just Uber and Grab users – in an upcoming technical working group (TWG) meeting which would decide the fate of the TNVS drivers. When asked what would happen to 80% of Uber and Grab drivers who do not have permits from July 26 onwards, he just said it would be discussed in the TWG meeting. According to Delgra, they plan to hold the meeting before July 26, the deadline for weeding out “colorum” drivers.

What I support is a more comprehensive campaign calling for better public transportation that benefits everyone – commuters and drivers alike.  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has halted the apprehension of undocumented drivers until Wednesday, July 26, 2017. Responding to this, Grab and Uber drivers united and launched an online campaign calling on the LTFRB to grant permits to additional Uber and Grab drivers.  I, however, think that saving Grab and Uber alone will not really solve our traffic woes in Metro Manila.  Let me start by sharing my experience with a taxi driver – whose name unfortunately escaped my memory – almost two years ago. Unfair boundary system  He told me that taxi drivers like him work 24 hours a day just so they could reach their boundary and earn enough to support his family for two days.  “Paano ‘nyo nakakaya (How do you do it)?” I asked.  “’Ayun Ma’am, lumalaklak ako ng Cobra at kape. Minsan sinasamahan ko pa ng Red bull. Ganoon talaga eh,” he answered with a smile. (Ma’am, I drink Cobra and coffee. Sometimes, I would also take strong energy drinks like Red Bull. That’s just how it is.) He said he would spend the following day in bed, gathering his strength for the next cycle on the road. The next day, he would start work at 5 am, weathering the traffic, unforgivable flooding and rain, and fatigue, and clock out exactly 24 hours later. He said this as a matter fact, without the slightest hint of complaint or regret. That is how he is able to put food on the table. How could he complain about it? Since then, I’ve made it my mission to ask every taxi driver I get to meet if this is how they lived. Majority of the taxi drivers – from the youngest to the 72-year-old driver I met – affirmed this.  The only ones who control their time and sleeping habit are those who are rich enough to own a cab. And that’s just a speck of the total taxi driver population in the Philippines.  The plight of bus drivers and conductors who would cram their vehicles with standing passengers during rush hour is no different. They are also limited by the boundary system that defines our public transportation system. This is the reality of many taxi and bus drivers in the country: the public transportation system is plainly inhumane to them.  False dichotomy How does this relate to the “We want Uber and Grab” campaign?  The current narrative surrounding the campaign creates a false dichotomy between the ride-sharing apps and traditional public utility vehicles. It is as if to favor one thing, you should be against the other.  But that misses the whole point.  It is true that Grab and Uber have served as an answered prayer for many commuters in Metro Manila,  However, Grab and Uber alone cannot solve traffic. In fact, they only add more franchises and cars on the road, benefitting only a certain portion of the commuter population that could afford its pricing rate on a daily basis. And how they leave more carbon footprint is a totally different matter.  What the country needs is better public transportation which essentially means fewer and more efficient modes of transportation – emphasis on train systems and buses – that have the capacity to transport more commuters.  Because of the false dichotomy, we forget that there are good and bad drivers regardless if they drive a cab or a Grab or Uber car. We’ve read it on social media, in news reports.  There are kind and honorable taxi drivers like Gener Jarito and Jhun Ochavo as there are rude drivers with the Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS).   Because of the false dichotomy, we also miss the fact the LTFRB is not only being inconsistent with its regulation of franchises. It has also failed to fix the boundary system in taxis and buses, and has fallen short in delivering its mandate to provide a decent means of livelihood for regular public utility vehicle drivers.  What is clear and sure is that it is wrong for the government to cut the lifeline of a temporary and functional solution such as Grab and Uber without providing a long-term solution to traffic for the public.  Proposal What should the government do then?  We are on the cusp of technological disruptions. Airbnb has redefined accommodation. Social media has empowered citizen journalism. Amazon has taken the retail industry on a whole new level. As early as now, we should be asking ourselves: In this age of technological disruptions, how do we make sure everybody gains from them? Right now, with the discussion on public transportation in the Philippines, the onus largely weighs on the government to make sure this gets addressed.  This is why I agree with Grab when it said that “we must level it up by improving the quality of service of other modes of public transport, and bring them at par with TNVS not by back-pedaling on the standards in place we have today.” In fact, the government might just be able to hit two birds with one stone. By learning how to adapt these advancements to benefit our taxi drivers, the government might be able to finally solve the problem surrounding the outdated taxi and bus boundary system that benefits no one but the franchise holders. While doing so, the government should definitely expedite its plan on improving, building, and expanding our train and bus systems. Let us step back and go beyond Uber and Grab. Let us pressure the government to provide an efficient public transportation that we deserve.  Because, honestly, with an efficient train system and better public transportation in general, discussions like these would be irrelevant and everyone would be happy. – Rappler.com   Raisa Serafica is a community manager and social media producer for MovePH, Rappler’s civic-engagement arm "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/175950-analysis-cracking-down-uber-grab-hurt-commuters/","title":"Cracking down on Uber and Grab will hurt commuters, not protect them","date":"Jul 18, 2017 1:23 PM PHT","snippet":"Just how valuable have Uber and Grab become for Filipino commuters?","body":"The daily commute around Metro Manila is bad as it is. But impending government regulations are about to make it downright painful. Starting July 26, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will apprehend and fine Uber and Grab drivers, and impound their cars, if found lacking the necessary permits. Before this, LTFRB fined Uber and Grab P5 million each for allowing such illegal or “colorum” vehicles to ply the streets. The LTFRB maintains that this crackdown is meant to protect commuters. One official said, “Paramount to LTFRB is the demand and the need [of the] riding public.” But will this crackdown really help commuters? In this article we argue that, given the significant value of ride-hailing services to Filipino commuters, this crackdown will invariably hurt the riding public, not protect them. Consumer value  Just how valuable have Uber and Grab become for Filipino commuters? In the US, a famous study found that UberX generated about $6.8 billion worth of “consumer surplus” in 2015 alone. That is, each dollar spent on UberX generated $1.60 worth of extra welfare for consumers—a hefty 60% return. Consumer surplus is difficult to measure, and to our knowledge no similar study in the Philippines yet exists (we are open to collaborate with Uber or Grab on this). However, one need only imagine our lives before Uber and Grab came along. Filipinos are tired of dealing with rude and crooked taxi drivers who refuse passengers based on their destinations, use rigged meters, charge arbitrary fares, and – for some reason – are always out of change. Uber and Grab allowed us to escape that horrible era. And based on commuters’ recent protests online, they’re not having more of it again. {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmario.limos%2Fposts%2F10155541327053147&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”626″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source} A crackdown will hurt commuters While Uber and Grab are a big win for commuters, they are a big loss for owners of regular taxis. With diminishing ridership and eroding profits, it comes as no surprise that regular taxi owners worldwide are intensely lobbying for government protection against ride-hailing. At the very least, regular taxi owners ask for a level playing field: that ride-hailing services be subjected to the same regulations as regular taxis. On the other extreme, some taxi owners call for a near or total prohibition of ride-hailing. Such a crackdown could indeed work in their favor: With prohibitive quotas on Uber and Grab vehicles, commuters will have no choice but to resort to regular taxis once more, thus increasing their market share and profits. Remaining Uber and Grab patrons will necessarily face higher prices and longer waiting times. By far, the biggest loss would come from the Uber and Grab rides that commuters can no longer hail. LTFRB’s crackdown next week promises to do just this. Around 80% of all ride-hailing vehicles are considered “colorum” by LTFRB, and cracking down on them could effectively cripple Uber and Grab’s operations. This move might raise the profits of a handful of taxi operators, but at what cost? The daily welfare of hundreds of thousands of Filipino commuters. “Colorum” not by choice Even more troubling is that many Uber and Grab drivers seem to have no choice but to be branded as “colorum.” For a year now, the LTFRB has stopped accepting and processing applications for Uber, Grab, and Uhop. In the process, 7,000 accredited drivers were denied renewal of their temporary permits, and as of January around 15,000 franchise applications have been denied. Hence, it appears that Uber and Grab drivers’ “colorum” status is not from a lack of effort to comply with LTFRB’s rules, but rather from LTFRB’s failure to act on these applications. To make matters worse, the LTFRB even threatened to discontinue Uber and Grab’s accreditations altogether if they “continue to defy the order.” One might ask: what is licensing good for, anyway, when “licensed” has come to mean rude and devious taxi drivers, and “colorum” is associated with courteous and honest Uber and Grab drivers? The term “colorum” should also be understood beyond its purely legalistic or regulatory sense: economically, it is a manifestation of an excess demand for rides. Quotas prevent the occurrence of mutually beneficial trades, so they will always incentivize “colorum” activities to make supply meet demand – irrespective of what the law says. Moreover, “colorum” was coined at a time when no technology was available to monitor vehicles and reward good customer service in real time. But with Uber and Grab, commuters can use their mobile apps to identify drivers, trace their routes, and rate their rides. Any errant driver can be easily made accountable, and drivers themselves can rate their passengers! Creative destruction Regulators also worry that Uber and Grab’s fast growth could worsen traffic congestion in the metro. But insofar as such vehicles are substitutes to taxis of the old, the growing fleets of Uber and Grab should pose no problem if we let old modes of transportation exit the roads. Indeed, every episode of rapid technological change brings with it some amount of unemployment, and is usually met by fierce opposition. In the same way that the horse-drawn carriage gave way to the automobile, the telegraph yielded to the telephone, and printed encyclopedias succumbed to the internet – the taxi industry is now reeling from the “creative destruction” brought forth by ride-hailing. But in the face of irreversible technological change, the best response is to embrace the new technology and assist those who lose their jobs in the process – not to shun or ban the new technology altogether.   Of course, this transition will require moving displaced people to alternative occupations. But in the case of taxi drivers, this need not be too difficult: with minimal training, for example, they can easily apply and work as drivers of ride-hailing services. Uber and Grab users, unite! What the majority of Filipinos need and deserve is an efficient, reliable, and safe mass transport system of trains and buses. But for a sizable segment of the riding public, Uber and Grab have provided a new, innovative, and viable option to move around the metro. Rather than just mere passing fads, ride-hailing services are here to stay. That is why a policy that prohibits 80% of ride-hailing vehicles will needlessly take away the level of convenience and dependability that commuters have come to love – and regular taxis routinely fail to provide. In a rare display of unity, commuters are protesting LTFRB’s impending crackdown in social media. An online petition to lift LTFRB’s suspension on new permit applications has already garnered 96,000 signatures, and counting. The LTFRB says they will “not succumb to pressure.” But this raises the question: whose interests are they really protecting? The advent of new technologies may catch regulators off guard. But this is hardly an excuse for them to add to the country’s roster of stupid and ridiculous policies – we already have enough of them to go around with. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan (@jcpunongbayan) is a PhD student at the UP School of Economics.

This is the message of the regulatory board to the transport network companies (TNCs) after both continued to allow unaccredited drivers to operate despite the order of the LTFRB to take them off the road. “If there would be a right-minded, law-abiding TNC who will be supportive of this, [we will support them], but for those TNCs who are not supportive or compliant, get your business elsewhere,” LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III said on Tuesday, July 18. “To Grab and Uber, do not come to us now to solve your mess,” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said. She said that the transport giants already earned “millions” from allowing over 30,000 drivers out of all 56,000 to operate for the past year even though they have not been registered with the LTFRB. Fix the mess Lizada and Delgra said that the mess began because of Grab and Uber. According to Delgra, the TNCs may have deliberately withdrawn from telling their “partner drivers” to come to the LTFRB to get a franchise before operating. “That is clear. Because if they knew, [they would not operate],” he said. Lizada recounted that she had visited an Uber registration office on Monday, July 17, and saw that it was “business as usual.” She said she asked around the office if they continued to allow new drivers to operate and they said yes. According to Delgra, the 30,000 who are not properly registered  will be tackled in their upcoming technical working group discussion. “The rules are very simple. I do not know why they cannot comply,” Delgra said. “We need to sit down, para ma-address natin ‘yung TNVS na nalagay ‘nyo sa alanganin (so that we can talk about the [drivers] you had put at risk),”  Lizada said. What happened? The feud can be traced to an LTFRB order dated July 21, 2016, stopping the franchising board from giving out provisional authority permits. These permits precede the certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise which is valid for one to 7 years. Because of this, the transport network companies could not get new drivers. Grab and Uber took matters into their own hands, as they had to replenish their ranks to accommodate “public demand.” For this, the LTFRB slapped them with a P5-million fine each and gave them until July 26, 2017, to clear out colorum drivers. The two companies’ accreditations are still pending for renewal. Grab’s expired last July 3, and Uber’s is set to expire in August. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/175895-grab-defy-ltfrb-until-meeting-commuters/","title":"Grab, Uber to keep drivers on the road until LTFRB clarifies order","date":"Jul 17, 2017 10:10 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Transport network giants Uber and Grab will keep their drivers on the road, even those without permits, as they await a clarification on the LTFRB order that stands to affect thousands of commuters","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Grab and Uber will keep their undocumented drivers on the roads until the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) clarifies its order, the transport network giants announced on Monday, July 17. “The new order by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has caused a lot of concern with the [transport network vehicle service] community. We understand the predicament of drivers, and so at this time we will not deactivate any of our partners,” Grab said in a statement. In a separate statement reported by ABS-CBN News, Uber said: “We will not deactivate. We continue to support our partner drivers. We are working with government on best way forward to level the playing field up.” The companies are reacting to the July 11, 2017 LTFRB order which demanded that transport network companies (TNCs) such as Grab and Uber purge its undocumented drivers, which make up 80% of all their operators, by July 26, 2017. According to Grab, they will only begin to expel undocumented drivers once they have a technical working group meeting, where commuters are invited to air out their concerns. (READ: LTFRB tells Grab, Uber: ‘We will not succumb to pressure’) “We urge the LTFRB to convene the technical working group as soon as possible so we can discuss important matters affecting the TNC-TNVS industry, more so the riding public,” Grab said. However, Grab said they are already taking steps to follow LTFRB as they have not allowed new drivers who do not have permits from the LTFRB to operate. Uber, for its part, continues to let new drivers without permits to operate, according to LTFRB board member Aileen Lozada. The number of these undocumented drivers grew dramatically over the last year because of an earlier LTFRB order which had barred new drivers from applying for provisional authority (PA) permits. These PA permits allow TNVS drivers to operate for 45-135 days, and precede the longer certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise which lasts from 1-7 years. With the LTFRB preventing the inflow of new drivers needed by TNCs to replace those who leave, Uber and Grab continued to accept and allow new drivers even without permits from the LTFRB. They also allowed drivers who had expired permits to continue to operate. This prompted the LTFRB to fine Uber and Grab P5 million each for negligence, and set the deadline for the removal of undocumented drivers. With their defiance of the LTFRB, Grab and Uber put themselves in hot water as their accreditation as a TNC is still under review by the regulatory board. But with overwhelming public support, they are confident they will pull through.  “The enforcement has been ongoing since last year in all cities where we operate. Be that as it may, Grab stands by the side of its partner-drivers who represent the safest most reliable transport service providers in the country,” Grab added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/175877-thewrap-july-17-2017-evening-edition/","title":"Pulse Asia survey, Ang, LTFRB | Evening wRap","date":"Jul 17, 2017 9:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"Today on Rappler: A new Pulse Asia survey showed President Rodrigo Duterte’s trust and performance ratings recovered from a significant dip earlier this year. San Miguel Corporation chief Ramon Ang is in talks with the owners of the Philippine Daily Inquirer for an acquisition of a majority stake in the daily newspaper. President Rodrigo Duterte tells Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales to shut up. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board says it won’t be pressured by an online petition for it to grant permits to additional Uber and Grab drivers. United States President Donald Trump goes back on the offensive against the media Sunday.

In the event that they refuse or fail to comply, then enforcement is in order. The board will not be influenced, it will not succumb to pressure,” LTFRB board member Aileen Lozada said on Monday. According to Grab head Brian Cu, the order might as well have been to close down their business as they need to continuously replenish their pool of drivers to accommodate “public demand.” Uber and Grab have allowed their drivers to continue plying the streets and kept on accepting new drivers even though they had expired permits or none at all, prompting the LTFRB to slap them with a P5-million fine each for negligence. “The TNCs have a duty to explain to their peer operators [why they accredited] them without [permits] issued by the board and that they take full responsibility for putting them at risk of operating illegally,” Lizada said. To give them breathing space, the LTFRB has halted the apprehension of undocumented drivers until July 26, 2017. Lizada warned that if they will still refuse to follow their orders beyond that date, their accreditation will be put at risk. “In the event that both TNCs will continue to defy the order, the board might be constrained to apply the full force of the law, considering that both accreditations are under review,” Lizada said. Grab’s accreditation expired last July 3, while Uber’s is set to expire in August. While Grab’s time is up, the LTFRB allowed them to operate. The LTFRB is now waiting for the full list of accredited drivers and the compliance of both TNCs before passing their judgment. During their show-cause hearing on July 11, Uber and Grab admitted that around 80% of their drivers are not properly documented, but only because the “majority” of those with expired permits asking for renewal are just waiting for LTFRB’s nod.

The junior officer, whose name Bensurto withheld, thanked him for being the once “lonely voice” that pushed for a case against China over the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea).  “Oh, I cannot describe to you the pain,” Bensurto said in an interview with Rappler in August 2016, when asked to explain why he was called a “lonely voice.” Bensurto, 52, was the silent hero behind the blueprint of the Philippines’ case against China at The Hague, in the face of naysayers in his own department. His work led to the Philippines’ historic victory against China, the first anniversary of which was marked on Wednesday, July 12. (READ: Rally world around Hague ruling, experts tell PH) Former foreign secretary Albert del Rosario told Rappler on Friday, July 14, “I would consider Henry as a quiet hero and a true patriot for his expertise, for his conviction, and for his courage.” “Without his important contributions, we may not have succeeded to the extent that had been achieved in obtaining a positive arbitral tribunal outcome to benefit the Filipino people and the world,” Del Rosario added. Journalist Bill Hayton, in his book The South China Sea: The Struggle for Power in Asia, also wrote that Bensurto “is the brains behind the Philippines’ policy in the South China Sea disputes.”  Bensurto’s role in the case is widely known, too, among diplomats in the region. In fact when we did our interview at the Manila Hotel lobby in August 2016, an Indonesian official passed by, greeted Bensurto, and congratulated him: “I remember this is your idea to bring the case to court.” ‘In my nature to take risks’ Bensurto, who has been Philippine consul general to San Francisco since June 2014, has been an achiever since his youth. When he was 25 years old, he took two of the Philippines’ hardest exams in the same year.  Bensurto ended up passing both the Bar Exam and the Foreign Service Officer Exam in 1991. “Maybe it’s in my nature to take risks,” he said. When the results of both exams came out, “it was a dilemma, because when you study law, you always have the instinct to litigate in a court.” “But I decided, at that time that there were few diplomats, maybe I can put to good use the legal skills in the context of diplomacy as well,” he said. Attorney Bensurto then entered the foreign service, and a few years later studied public international law at Oxford University under a Chevening scholarship.  An alumnus of both the University of the Philippines and San Beda College, he graduated from Oxford with distinction in 1996. No ‘pass your paper’ mentality At the DFA, Bensurto was the kind of diplomat whom his bosses often wanted to keep in the Philippines because they needed his skills.  His batchmates, for instance, got their first international assignments after 3 years as junior officers based in the Philippines. It took Bensurto 9 years before he got posted abroad. “The reason for that is because my boss asked me to stay put and help,” he explained.  One of the projects he handled was the development of the Roppongi property in Japan, which the Philippines got as reparation from Japan after World War II. Bensurto and his colleagues finished this project in the late 1990s, and now “one of the most beautiful embassies we have overseas is the one in Roppongi, Japan.”  Looking back at these experiences, Bensurto said he has no regrets even if he was often stuck in the Philippines. “I think there’s a saying in the department: Don’t make yourself indispensable, because when you make yourself indispensable, you get stuck,” he said. In his case, Bensurto said, “I just have this mentality that when you’re given work, you have to do the best that you can, because you owe it not only to your government and to your country.” Bensurto said he resists a “pass your paper” mentality. First partnership with Del Rosario  Bensurto brought this work ethic with him when he was finally assigned to Washington DC in 1999. He worked there as consul and legal officer. It was in Washington DC that he first worked with Del Rosario, the Philippine ambassador to the US from 2001 to 2006. In the US, Bensurto faced one of his toughest tests, when the US justice department “tried to assume criminal jurisdiction” over executives “of all the telecommunication companies in the Philippines,” including PLDT. This was for the alleged violation of the US anti-trust law. Del Rosario requested him to address this problem.  Bensurto said he thought of arguing the Philippines’ case in a court of law, even if private lawyers felt pessimistic “because the batting average of the US Department of Justice in terms of anti-trust violations was almost 100% at that time.” “But I never wavered in that,” Bensurto said. And the Philippines won. “It was also an ‘impossible’ undertaking, an ‘impossible’ task,” he said. Referring to Del Rosario, he also pointed out, “This is our first partnership.”  ‘It’s ADR and myself’ Years later in Manila, Bensurto and Del Rosario worked together again by 2011, when the former ambassador became secretary of foreign affairs. Bensurto said Del Rosario “wanted a more creative solution” to the South China Sea dispute “because we were like talking to a wall.”  Back then at the DFA, Bensurto was the most equipped to tackle this issue.  On top of his studies in Oxford, where he took as many electives as possible on the law of the sea, Bensurto also went to the Rhodes Academy of Oceans Law and Policy in Greece. In 2007, he became the first secretary general of the Commission on Maritime and Ocean Affairs. Bensurto later helped in passing the Archipelagic Baselines Law of 2009, for which he received the Presidential Award of Gawad Mabini (with the Rank of Commander), according to a profile uploaded by the National University of Singapore. He also conceptualized a blueprint to address all of the Philippines’ maritime concerns. In 2010, he finalized what he called the Philippine Maritime Security Strategy that aimed to create a Zone of Peace, Freedom, Friendship, and Cooperation (ZOPFFC) in the South China Sea.  Armed with his expertise, Bensurto was convinced of bringing China to court, particularly to a legally-binding compulsory arbitration on the sea dispute.  Bensurto discussed this with Del Rosario, and later the two of them brought this proposal to then president Benigno Aquino III.  “But I wouldn’t want to grab credit on my own because from my perspective, I always understand the issue as a collective partnership of different people, and I think it was critical that ADR and I were on the same page,” he said. Aquino ended up deciding to file a case against China. The Philippines won this on July 12, 2016.  Bensurto said: “We don’t call it ZOPFFC now. We call it the tribunal decision. What we have achieved in the arbitration is precisely ZOPFFC.” Asked if he alone presented the winning strategy to Aquino, Bensurto also referred to Del Rosario, whom he called by his initials ADR. “I would like to look at it as ADR and myself, because the truth of the matter is, ideas will not prosper if you don’t have the right champion.” ‘Work has a higher meaning’ Bensurto, of course, had to face a number of challenges. “We had to overcome a lot of resistance, even from within,” he said. “If not for ADR, I would have been a lone wolf.” (READ: ‘Del Rosario diplomacy’ hailed amid PH victory) In the face of his critics, the diplomat also credited his colleagues at the Commission on Maritime and Ocean Affairs – “the people who believed in me and worked with me all the way.” Del Rosario himself said Bensurto is “a man of conviction who stood up at all times to promote the national interest, notwithstanding difficult challenges which we had to surmount.” At the same time, Bensurto also pointed out “trade-offs” in his personal life. For one, because of the West Philippine Sea issue, he got stuck in the Philippines for more than a year after his last foreign posting, unlike many of his colleagues. “I was here for about 7 years.” He said this was difficult because Filipino diplomats get lower salaries when they stay in the Philippines. For diplomats, “your opportunity to help yourself financially is when you’re posted abroad,” he said. “It had a lot of practical consequences for me and my family, because to give up a foreign assignment is not easy, in a sense, because you give up the opportunity to help yourself and your family, the financial ability to make your financial standing a little stable,” he said. Still, Bensurto said, “I have no regrets because it’s for the country.” In the end, Bensurto said he draws his convictions from something deeper. “For me, work has a higher meaning.” Work, he said, “is something that you’re able to do to help yourself, to help your family, and to help others.” “But more than that,” he added, “and I have to apologize, and pardon me for this, it’s something that you can offer to God. It’s something that you can sanctify yourself with.”  “Work is something that can be used as a raw material to get closer to God, to get closer to others, and at the same time help others,” said the diplomat, lawyer, and silent hero named Henry Bensurto Jr. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/175633-ltfrb-halts-order-undocumented-uber-grab-drivers/","title":"LTFRB halts apprehension order vs undocumented Uber, Grab drivers","date":"Jul 14, 2017 7:36 PM PHT","snippet":"They have a breathing space until July 26","body":" MANILA, Philippines—The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will stop apprehending colorum Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) drivers until July 26, the regulatory board announced on Friday, July 14. “There is no order yet issued by the board to apprehend colorum TNVS.

Aquino made the call a day after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) slapped a P5-million fine each on Grab and Uber for letting some of their drivers operate without permits. “We need to provide the commuting public with better options and alternatives to improve their daily commuting experience. The government must work with rideshare companies that share this mission and develop suitable standards and requirements for them,” Aquino said in a statement on Wednesday, July 12. “I urge the LTFRB to address this issue of penalties for rideshare companies. Then we can focus on passing legislation to develop the industry and to ensure these new transport networks are held accountable for offenses,” he added. Last year, Aquino filed Senate Bill 696 or the Rideshare Support Company Act, which seeks “to encourage new, affordable, and safe transportation options and ensure the safety of the riding public by imposing safety and financial responsibility standards and requirements.” “In any industry, increased competition often leads to improved quality, improved service, and lower prices for consumers. For the commuting public, this is a change they have long clamored for,” the senator said in his explanatory note to SB 696. The LTFRB said it considered public sentiment in dealing with the rideshare companies, as shown by its decision to impose hefty fines on Grab and Uber. If the LTFRB were to follow penalties stated in LTFRB MC 2015-016, Grab and Uber’s operations should have been shut down. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Tuesday that the interest of the riding public “overrides” the provision. On Wednesday, Aquino renewed his push for SB 696 which seeks to institutionalize a regulatory framework for the new type of service. SB 696 clarifies the regulations governing transportation network companies or rideshare support sompanies (RSCs), and rideshare network drivers and vehicles.

Classified as Transport Network Companies (TNCs), Grab and Uber admitted that they allowed some Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) drivers to operate even if they do not have permits. “It appears that the TNCs are not without fault for having these TNVS [drivers] operating illegally,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said.”We need to be mindful of our responsibilities not only as TNVS [drivers] but also as TNCs.” LTFRB gives two kinds of permits to TNVS drivers – the provisional authority (PA) permit valid for 45 to 135 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise which is valid for 1 to 7 years. According to the LTFRB, of the 10,054 names of active drivers that Uber submitted, they found that the PA of 5,850 were dismissed while 3,505 are still in the process of applying. This leaves less than 2,000 as having complete permits. Grab has not submitted its list. According to TNVS drivers themselves, the number of “colorum” drivers spiked in the last year mainly because of LTFRB Memorandum Circular (MC) 2016-008 which suspended the issuance of new PAs beginning July 21, 2016. (READ: Grab, Uber drivers ask LTFRB to lift ban on new driver applications) In addition to negligence, the LTFRB also took into account the TNCs’ violation of LTFRB MC 2015-016, which mandates the following: ‘Strong passenger demand’ {source}<iframe width=”560″ height=”315″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZ_tcPxYSxo” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe>{/source}   Grab country head Brian Cu admitted in the hearing that they accepted new drivers despite the earlier order of the LTFRB. “Admittedly, we accepted because if we stopped accepting we might as well have closed down the business. New drivers come in and fall out if we do not replace the drivers… we would lose drivers and not be able to serve our [customers],” Cu said. When asked by Delgra whether the move was for “marketing reasons” so that competition would not get their clients, representatives from Uber agreed. In their defense, Grab and Uber invoked passengers’ needs. “In all honesty everyone we accepted since July are still ‘colorum.’ They remain on the road. Because there is [a] demand that is needed to be met, we let them,” Cu said. Delgra noted, however, that demand does not justify illegal operations. He likened the TNCs’ alibi to a manufacturer of fake license plates who argues there is demand for such. If the LTFRB were to follow penalties stated in MC 2015-016, Grab and Uber’s operations should have been shut down. But according to LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada, the interest of the riding public “overrides” the provision. But while the transport network giants were not ordered closed, their accreditation as TNCs will still be reviewed. Grab’s accreditation expired on July 3, while Uber’s is set to expire in August. Lizada also said the LTFRB will form a technical working group that will meet with the TNCs to set a deadline for the elimination of illegal operations. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/174976-megan-young-consultant-miss-world-philippines-2017/","title":"Megan Young is a consultant for Miss World Philippines 2017","date":"Jul 9, 2017 2:04 PM PHT","snippet":"Megan says her plans in New York have been temporarily pushed back to give way to the Miss World Philippines competition and her other commitments in Manila","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Megan Young is adding a new job description to her resume – special consultant for the new Miss World Philippines team.

We want this to be something very special,” she said. While it’s not easy to win the Miss World competition, Megan advised the candidates to think beyond getting the crown itself. “Huwag mo isipin ang crown.

How? Through a petition. TopSpeed and Busypaps, organizations consisting of at least 250 Uber and Grab drivers, urged on Friday, July 7, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTRB) to lift their ban on new driver applications. “Kami po ay umaapela sa mabuting puso ng ating mga opisyal sa LTFRB, sana po ay pakinggan nyo ang aming hiling na bigyang amnestiya ang aming mga kasamahan na wala pa pong provisional authority,” TopSpeed Bobby Coronel said, reading their petition. (We are appealing to the LTFRB, we hope you listen to our request to grant amnesty to our colleagues who still do not have provisional authority [permits].) They are rallying against an LTFRB Memorandum Circular 2016-008 issued on July 21, 2016, which suspended the applications for the provisional authority (PA), or temporary permits to operate, for Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) applicants.  The order was released to limit operations of TNVS while LTFRB prepares a pitch on how to further regulate TNVS providers. The Philippines is the first country to regulate TNVS service providers. TNVS simply pertains to any transport service where commuters and drivers get matched through an application. The 45-day PA permit is the precursor for the regular permit, which is renewed every 3 years. Ever since the order was implemented, thousands who wanted to drive for transportation network companies (TNCs) or providers of TNVS, were barred from applying.  This has forced the aspiring TNC drivers to go to other transport services like airport car services, or to become taxi drivers, Coronel said. 7,000 in limbo  While applicants have been rejected from applying as TNVS drivers, some 7,000 already-accredited drivers did not get their PAs renewed in 2016, with all of them having expired PA permits by December 2016, Busypaps president Jephthe Gamad said. “We are not colorum by choice, our colleagues were left with no choice,” they said in the petition.”Many of us were unemployed, some are retirees. We were given the chance to be productive in becoming partners of TNVS companies.” LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra clarified in an earlier press conference that the drivers can “renew or extend the PA”. Drivers applied for renewal and extension, but according to Gamad, LTFRB has not processed their applications. “Nakapagpa-renew naman kami. Ang problema lang kasi hindi kami nilalabasan ng papeles, (We renewed our PAs, but the problem is that they have not given us our documents),” Gamad told Rappler. He added that since December 2016 most drivers already had expired PAs. Some continued to drive and said that they were not apprehended by the LTFRB, while some were forced to go off the road. As drivers who do not own the cars they drove, they were forced off the road by their operators – the car owners – who feared penalty from apprehension. “Medyo masakit on our part, we do our best to give riding experience to our commuters. Yun lang ang tanong eh, bakit tinatangkilik pa rin kami kung pangit ang serbisyo namin?” Coronel told Rappler. (It pains us that we are doing our best to provide [a good] riding experience to our commuters.

The TransAsia Airways flight was carrying 54 passengers and 4 crew when it smashed into trees and houses as it attempted to land in a typhoon on Taiwan’s scenic Penghu island. Just 9 people survived. Lee Chia-feng and Ching Yuan-wu – who were responsible for runway use and landing approval – were charged last year with negligence over the incident. But while acknowledging that the officers made errors, the Penghu district court said the crash was ultimately down to the pilots, who were among those killed. “The main cause of the accident was because the flight crew did not follow the standard landing procedures,” the court said in a statement. “Operating a flight is highly dependent on the front-line crew acting in accordance with their training and standards. This is even more so during a typhoon, when the climate can change quickly.” The Aviation Safety Council said in its investigation report last year the pilots were flying below the minimum altitude required in poor visibility in a procedural mistake widespread among TransAsia’s pilots at the time. Less than a year after the Penghu accident, another TransAsia flight dramatically crashed into a river shortly after take-off from Taipei, killing 43 people and raising serious concerns about the airline’s safety standards. The dramatic crash of flight GE235 in February 2015 grabbed global headlines as car dashcam footage showed it clipping a road bridge before careering into the water.

In a potentially dramatic shift in diplomatic roles, the European Union now aims to join heavyweight China in trying to galvanize the world into implementing the landmark 2015 agreement – but minus the planet’s second biggest carbon polluter. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Council President Donald Tusk and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang are vowing to forge ahead with the Paris agreement without the US when they meet in Brussels Friday morning. Juncker denounced as “seriously wrong” US President Donald Trump’s shock announcement Thursday, June 1, to pull out of the deal that his predecessor Barack Obama and Chinese leaders had been instrumental in brokering. Echoing earlier remarks from his boss, EU commissioner for climate action and energy, Miguel Arias Canete, pledged continued “global leadership” on climate change. Trump’s “announcement has galvanized us rather than weakened us, and this vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership,” Canete said.  “Europe and its strong partners all around the world are ready to lead the way,” the Spanish commissioner said on the eve of the summit. In talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday, Li said it was in China’s own interest to press ahead “steadfastly” with the Paris deal, and urged other countries to do likewise. China, the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has been investing billions in clean energy infrastructure, as its leaders battle to clear up the notorious choking pollution enveloping its biggest cities, including Beijing. China and the US, the second biggest polluter, are together responsible for some 40 percent of the world’s emissions and experts had warned that it is vital for both to remain in the Paris agreement if it is to have any chance of succeeding. But Canete said the EU will work with existing partners and forge new alliances, including with the world’s largest economies as well as the many US citizens, businesses and communities that support the Paris agreement. ‘Significantly intensify’ The Paris agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and more violent weather events. They vowed steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times and to “pursue efforts” to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Juncker has noted that it would take three or four years to exit the Paris deal, and revealed that world leaders had tried in vain to explain that to Trump at the G7 summit a week ago. A draft joint summit statement seen by Agence France-Presse said the EU and Chinese leaders will stress “their highest political commitment” into implementing all aspects of the Paris deal.  “The EU and China consider the Paris Agreement as an historic achievement further accelerating the irreversible global low greenhouse gas emission and climate resilient development,” the nine-page draft said.  They vow to “significantly intensify” their political, technical, economic and scientific cooperation on climate change and clean energy to help the world shift to an economy based on low greenhouse gas emissions. Hoping to make the climate fight a “main pillar” of their bilateral partnership, including economic ties, the two underlined that their cooperation will fuel job creation, investments and economic growth, the statement said. In announcing the pullout, Trump said the Paris pact was a bad deal that may or not be renegotiated, adding it punished the United States and was too easy on China, India and Europe. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/171517-rebisco-psl-manila-falls-vietnam-8th-place-asian-club-championships/","title":"Rebisco-PSL Manila falls to Vietnam, finishes 8th in Asian Club Championships","date":"May 31, 2017 2:50 PM PHT","snippet":"Jaja Santiago remains the top scorer for the Philippine club, anchoring the offense with 10 markers, all off spikes, to go with 5 excellent digs","body":" MANILA, Philippines－ Rebisco-PSL Manila showed signs of life in the 2017 Asian Women’s Club Championships (AWCC), but wound up winless after falling to Vietnam’s Vietin Bank anew, 13-25, 18-25, 15-25 on Wednesday, May 31, at the Boris Alexandrov Sports Palace in Kazakhstan. In the battle for 7th seed, Vietin Bank again capitalized on the Manila squad’s defensive lapses as it catapulted to a 17-8 start in the opening set, and listed 17 excellent attacks on the board compared to Rebisco-PSL’s 7. The Pinay spikers tried to reverse the tables in the second, snatching a 9-4 run early on. But the Vietnam club kept its composure as it slowly grabbed the lead midway through the set following a reception error from the Philippine side, to later on wrap up with a 2-0 control of the match. Pham Thi Kim Hue produced a game-high 16 points on 14 spikes, while Doan Thi Xuan had 12 points with two off blocks and 3 service aces.

He keeps shoving it, and it keeps retreating, not even digging in, or defending, much less fighting back.","body":" Doubtless many of us, not just in this town but in many other places, have become anxiously preoccupied by the thought of freedom. Indeed, there would seem an anti-freedom virus going around if you observed the temperament of present-day leaders; these, by the way, are no power-grabbers, as were the previous kind, but leaders installed by popular vote, which is why the phenomenon is called populism, a generous, though not altogether unsuitable, description. Strictly, populism is a kind of party movement in itself, as such organized; it’s not people making an accidental common choice. At any rate, we have, as it happens, an example of each kind. Of the previous kind, there was Ferdinand Marcos, who simply took power one day and ruled for 14 years as a martial-law dictator. And of the present kind, there’s Rodrigo Duterte, who received his popular mandate under no pretense; those who may regret having voted for him have no excuse: from the beginning, he has not only professed idolatry for Marcos, but anointed Ferdinand Jr. as his successor. The phenomenon proving intractable, it is put down to “something in the air”, and, World Press Freedom Day falling around this time, it should particularly concern the very profession called upon by the Constitution to stand up to the likes of Duterte and Marcos – the press. As a journalist who has known no other profession, thus always anxious for self-assurance and jealous with his freedom, I seize freedom as a birthright. Admittedly, freedom does not work so simplistically; it has to be fought for, constantly. Anyway, what choice do I really have? What choice does the press have?  Enemy of freedom On May 3, the day declared by the United Nations as World Press Freedom Day, two journalists asked me for a meeting for the same day for whatever I, as an old hand, might have to say of any worth about press freedom. One came, the other cancelled, saying “they” – whom I took to be his superiors – voted down, “for obvious reasons”, his idea for a commemorative piece. The reasons are not really so obvious to me, but, observing how the press covers President Duterte, I may have an idea. I’ve watched the press let him say anything little challenged. If only it felt less cowed and probed more, his word might just prove not good enough, if not outright inaccurate. As it is, much of his word stands as he has passed it off, as fact – drugs are the plague of the times and that plague translates into 3 million addicts and, until those 3 million are exterminated, this nation will continue to languish in poverty (where did he get that number when the last credibly sourced one was 1.8 million?); or as credible promise – 8 trillion pesos will be spent on infrastructure during his six-year term (where will he get that money?) and there will be no poor Filipino by 2040 (wouldn’t he be safely dead by then?). To be sure, Duterte could be an intimidating figure – profane, narcissistic, authoritarian. But then he is precisely the sort of character press freedom is ranged against. In fact he personifies power, the natural enemy of freedom, in the extreme. And, under Duterte’s draconian regime, press freedom in particular is under siege. He keeps shoving it, and it keeps retreating, not even digging in, or defending, much less fighting back. Yes, indeed, part of the exercise of any democratic freedom is fighting back, and, for the press it consists in asking questions in the very least. As one newspaper motto goes, “If you ask no questions you will be told no truths.” – Rappler.com              "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/166853-pacers-bulls-grab-playoff-spots/","title":"Pacers, Bulls grab playoff spots, Heat come up short","date":"Apr 13, 2017 2:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Paul George's 32 points and 11 rebounds helps Pacers secure the seventh seed while the Bulls earned the eighth seed","body":" LOS ANGELES, USA – Paul George delivered 32 points and 11 rebounds as the Indiana Pacers punched their ticket to the NBA postseason Wednesday, April 12 (Thursday Manila time) with a 104-86 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. Jeff Teague added 19 points and 7 assists before twisting his left ankle and leaving the game in the fourth quarter as the Pacers grabbed the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference on the final day of the 2016-17 regular season. Indiana will open the postseason against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference to the Boston Celtics after the Cavs’ defeat by the Toronto Raptors 98-83. “I’m excited about the opportunity,” said George, who made 12 of 21 field goal attempts against the Hawks. “I guess that’s because we’re doing everything right. “When our back is against the wall, we figure things out,” he added. “It just showed the character of this team, that we knew all along that we should have been a playoff team. We just had to figure out how to play the right way.”  Boston beat the Milwaukee Bucks 112-94 to help relegate Cleveland to the second seed and solidify home court advantage through the first three rounds of the playoffs. The Golden State Warriors are the top seed in the Western Conference and will host game one of a best-of-seven series Sunday against the Portland Trail Blazers.  Having clinched the No. 5 spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs with a Tuesday night victory against Charlotte, Atlanta sat guard Kent Bazemore, guard Tim Hardaway, forward Paul Millsap and guard Dennis Schroder against Indiana. Atlanta will begin the playoffs against the fourth-seeded Washington Wizards. The other missing playoff component heading into Wednesday’s final games was who would get the fourth seed in the West. Both the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers won on Wednesday, but the Clippers claimed home court advantage in their first round series based on their head-to-head tiebreaker over the Jazz. Indiana steadily pulled away Wednesday to qualify for the playoffs for a second consecutive season and the 22nd time in the past 28 seasons. Myles Turner added 18 points and eight rebounds for Indiana, which finished the regular season with five consecutive wins. The Hawks were led by Ersan Ilyasova’s 15 points. Jose Calderon added 12 and Taurean Prince scored 11. The Pacers got a 14-point third quarter from Teague and made 11 of 17 field goal attempts during a crucial scoring run as they stretched a seven-point halftime lead to an 84-68 lead at the end of the third quarter. Bulls clinch Elsewhere, Jimmy Butler scored a team-high 25 points and the Chicago Bulls clinched a playoff berth with a 112-73 victory over the hapless Brooklyn Nets. “We all did our job to get us into the playoffs,” Butler said. “Now it’s about winning some games. We’ve just got to stick together and focus on ourselves.”  Rookie forward Paul Zipser added a career-high 21 points off the bench. Chicago claimed the eighth and final seed in the East and will meet the mighty Celtics in the first round. Guard Archie Goodwin scored 20 points to lead the Nets. Brooklyn dropped to 20-62 on the season and finished with the worst record in the NBA and the fourth-most losses in franchise history. Chicago shot 43 percent from the field and 47 percent from beyond the arc. The Bulls finished the regular season with an impressive 25-16 record at home. But it’s a different picture when they go on the road, where they have just 16 wins and 25 losses. However, that doesn’t worry veteran Dwyane Wade, who is just happy to be in another playoff. “As a player, 14 years, I think I’ve been in 12 playoffs,” Wade said. “This is what I play for. This is what I enjoy. You always want to play your best when the lights are the brightest.”  Meanwhile in Miami, Goran Dragic scored 28 points and the Miami Heat fell short of reaching the playoffs despite a 110-102 victory over the Washington Wizards. Miami (41-41) became the first team in league history to finish .500 or above after being at least 12 games below .500. Miami reversed an 11-30 record the first half of the season with a 30-11 finish. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/165386-grabtricycle-rides-mandaluyong/","title":"Grab offers free tricycle rides in Mandaluyong","date":"Mar 27, 2017 8:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Passengers can use the ride-hailing app to book a free tricycle ride in selected areas in Mandaluyong City from March 27 to April 5","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing service Grab is beta-testing a new service using a very Filipino mode of transportation: the tricycle.  From March 27 to April 5, Grab users in Mandaluyong City can avail of free tricycle rides to get around selected areas, using the app to hail and book a ride with just a few taps.  The service is available from 8 am to 5 pm, along the following streets:  To book a ride, passengers need to choose the GrabTricycle icon on their app, select pick-up and drop-off locations within the specific areas mentioned, and add the promo code GRABTRIKE before booking.

Grab's newest service, GrabShare, aims to do something about that","body":" MANILA, Philippines — Long, winding lines at the MRT station; suffocatingly packed buses and vans; the numbingly slow crawl of EDSA traffic — this is just a glimpse into a day in the life of a Metro Manila commuter. To say the traffic situation in the Philippines is bad would be an understatement. According to a Ford survey published in several major news sites, 30% of Filipinos consider commuting the worst part of their day. And it’s largely because of the current state of available public transportation options: crowded, uncomfortable, and inconvenient.   But as much as Filipinos hate it, there’s no avoiding it. Everyone still needs to go to work, visit their families, have dinner and drinks with friends. So what’s a commuter to do?  Companies are now coming up with new ride-sharing options that aim to change the way Filipinos look at getting from point A to point B.  A new way to commute In a media launch help last February 16 at The Brewery in BGC, Grab introduced GrabShare, the company’s first on-demand commercial ride-sharing service in the Philippines. With GrabShare, commuters can expect to share their ride with only 1 other passenger for up to 30% cheaper fares than GrabCar (Sedan). GrabShare allows a maximum of only one additional detour per ride, to make sure that the passengers’ time and money are not wasted. The new service will introduce cheaper fares for passengers and more income for drivers by allowing them to complete two bookings in one trip.   GrabShare works by using a “matching algorithm” to help passengers get to their destinations in the shortest time possible. The algorithm factors in the closest available drivers, travel time, overlap of trip routes, detour distance, and current traffic conditions before sequencing pick-ups and drop-offs so commuters can experience the most efficient and practical rides.  Grab claims that Filipinos who are used to sharing seats in cramped vehicles now have a more comfortable and convenient option for getting around.  Perks for both passengers and drivers GrabShare was first launched in Singapore in December 2016, and was considered a huge success. In 2 months, 2 million GrabShare rides were completed, covering a total distance of about 20 million kilometers. Since more passengers have been choosing GrabShare, Grab has improved their passenger matching rate by 15%, and with it, increases Grab drivers’ monthly incomes by 10%.  So in addition to providing Filipinos with a better option for ride-sharing, GrabShare also helps their drivers increase their potential earnings. While the traffic situation in Metro Manila still leaves much to be desired, at least now Filipinos are not limited to their usual commuting options. And ride-sharing doesn’t necessarily have to be associated with sweaty lines and cramped seating arrangements anymore. As people and technology evolve, so can the future of our commute. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/162013-pelicans-anthony-davis-2017-all-star-mvp/","title":"NBA: Pelicans’ Davis grabs All-Star MVP on home court","date":"Feb 20, 2017 2:32 PM PHT","snippet":"The teams combine for 374 points and it is the second straight year the East and West teams broke the combined record","body":"NEW ORLEANS, USA – Anthony Davis scored a record 52 points on his home court as the West team continued their domination by outgunning the East 192-182 in the 66th annual NBA All-Star Game. The New Orleans Pelicans star Davis was named MVP and broke the scoring record of 42 points set by Wilt Chamberlain in 1962. He made 26 of 39 shots from the field, eclipsing Blake Griffin’s 2014 record of 19 field goals in an All-Star game. “I was shocked,” Davis said. “I am just happy I was able to take the MVP home in front of home fans. “The guys said they were going to give me the ball. They were men of their word. “It was fun game. I didn’t want anybody to get hurt.”  Defense was non-existent at the Smoothie King Center arena as Davis set the tone with 22 first-half points and Oklahoma City Thunder’s Russell Westbrook combined on a couple of playful passing exchanges including one in the opening quarter with former teammate Kevin Durant. The teams combined for 374 points and it was the second straight year the teams broke the combined record. Last year, the teams set a record of 369 in the West’s 196-173 win. Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said the league should look at inducements to get the players to try harder. “I would like to see it more competitive. It’d be good to have incentives for the guys, get charities involved,” Kerr said of the lack of defense. The East was led by Milwaukee Bucks center Giannis Antetokounmpo, who scored 28 points, and Cleveland’s LeBron James, making his 13th All-Star start, with 23 points. Westbrook tallied 41 points as he was reunited for one night with Durant, who is in his first season with the Golden State Warriors after leaving the Thunder.

Desakan itu disampaikan dalam aksi demonstrasi yang dilakukan di Alun-Alun Utara kota Yogyakarta pada Jumat, 15 Februari. Ada ratusan pengemudi yang terlibat dalam aksi unjuk rasa. Mereka mengawali aksi dengan berjalan kaki dari Jalan Malioboro. Selain berorasi, mereka juga memampang berbagai poster berisi kecaman terhadap taksi berbasis online. “Operator taksi mati, malah pengemudinya mati duluan,” kata Koordinator Aksi Komunitas Pengemudi, Sutiman di Alun-Alun Utara Kota Yogyakarta pada Jumat, 15 Februari. Dia mengatakan para peserta aksi baru separuh dari total pengemudi taksi konvensional di Yogyakarta. Sebagian pengemudi taksi lainnya tetap beroperasi agar pemberian layanan terhadap penumpang tidak terganggu. “Tapi, kalau tidak ada kemajuan, (kami) akan all out turun semua,” kata dia. Saat ini, tercatat ada 20 operator taksi di Yogyakarta. Dengan armada mencapai 1.025 unit, masing-masing operator mengoperasikan sekitar 60 unit kendaraan. Sementara, jumlah pengemudi mencapai 2.500 orang. Sutiman mengatakan sejak marak beroperasinya taksi berbasis online, pendapatan para pengemudi taksi konvensional turun drastis. Taksi Pamungkas Primkoppol, tempat Sutiman bekerja misalnya, mewajibkan setiap pengemudi menyetor Rp 270 ribu per hari. “Tetapi, sekarang paling banter sehari mendapat Rp 150 ribu,” kata dia. Perolehan per hari itu belum termasuk untuk keperluan membeli bahan bakar kendaraan, makan dan upah yang dibawa pulang ke rumah. Akibatnya, banyak pengemudi berhutang setoran pada perusahaan. Tiap perusahaan taksi menetapkan batasan berbeda untuk hutang setoran pengemudi. Jumlahnya beragam, dimulai dari Rp 300 ribu hingga Rp 500 ribu. Jika hutang setoran melebihi batas, maka pengemudi dilarang beroperasi. Sulit beradaptasi Sebenarnya sebagian besar operator taksi konvensional di Yogyakarta sudah mulai menerapkan aplikasi online untuk menggaet pelanggan. Tetapi, tak semua pengemudi menerapkan untuk mencari penumpang. “Susah (menggunakannya),” kata Sarwidi alias Kacung, pengemudi Taksi Sadewo pada Jumat, 17 Februari. Taksi Sadewo kata dia juga sudah menerapkan aplikasi bernama Taxies. Aplikasi yang dipasang di telepon genggam itu juga dimanfaatkan oleh dua operator taksi lainnya yakni Indra Kelana dan Pandawa. Tetapi, bagi lelaki 49 tahun itu, jangankan untuk mengoperasikan fiturnya, menggunakan telepon genggam layar sentuh pun dia kesulitan. 10 tahun bekerja menjadi pengemudi taksi, dia terbiasa mengandalkan radio panggil yang terpasang di kendaraan untuk mendapat penumpang. Hal itu semakin diperparah dengan menjamurnya taksi berbasis online seperti Grab Car dan Go Car. Pasalnya, sejak beroperasi di Yogyakarta membuat penghasilan mereka anjlok drastis. Penumpang memilih menumpang taksi online yang tarifnya lebih murah. Sering kali ia tidak mendapat penumpang. Padahal, Sarwidi harus mengumpulkan uang setoran senilai Rp 280 ribu setiap harinya kepada perusahaan. Selain menerapkan aplikasi berbasis telepon genggam, ada juga perusahaan taksi yang menawarkan undian berhadiah bagi penumpang. Tetapi, toh strategi itu tak cukup menarik penumpang. Faktor tarif tetap menjadi daya tarik. Ketua III Organisasi Angkutan Darat Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta yang membidangi unit taksi, Taryoto, mengatakan salah satu alasan harga taksi online bisa murah karena mereka tidak mengurus persyaratan seperti izin trayek, pajak dan uji KIR. “Sementara, kalau kami di taksi argometer pakai itu,” ujar Taryoto. Gubernur Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwono X mengatakan kendaraan berplat hitam dilarang beroperasi sebagai angkutan umum. Untuk mengatasi persoalan itu, ia berjanji akan berkomunikasi dengan Kementerian Perhubungan di Jakarta, Senin pekan depan. “Wewenangnya bukan di saya,” kata Sri Sultan. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/161696-grab-philippines-growth-grabshare/","title":"Grab PH wants to bring GrabCar to more cities","date":"Feb 16, 2017 7:37 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab is lobbying the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to lift the suspension of applications for application-based transport vehicles","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines wants to bring its private car service GrabCar to 4 other cities where it has already established its presence.

I think they are waiting for the omnibus franchise policy. Right now, it is just a memorandum circular,” Cu said. It was in July 2016 when LTFRB suspended applications for TNVS due to the surge of applicants and the review of their fare scheme. Still double-digit growth Cu said when it comes to profit, Grab Philippines “expects double-digit revenue growth in 2016.” This is despite the “stunted expansion” due to the LTFRB moratorium. “In 2016, demand was still strong. Up to now, we are still continuing to see demand. We believe we solve a present need that is why we are working with the legislation,” Grab Philippines’ country head said.  Grab on Thursday, February 16, announced the regional launch of GrabShare, the company’s first on-demand commercial carpooling service, with its introduction in the Philippines and Malaysia. In exchange for sharing their ride, passengers enjoy cheaper fares and a maximum of only one additional detour. Meanwhile, drivers earn more by completing two bookings in one trip. To help win the Southeast Asian market, Grab VP for Marketing Cheryl Goh had earlier said her company was taking a friendlier road than its rivals. While some of Grab’s rivals have developed a reputation for being combative, Goh had said they are leaning towards a “more open and collaborative working environment” with regulators. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/bahasa-indonesia/160324-grab-indonesia-master-plan-2020/","title":"Grab Indonesia paparkan master plan hingga tahun 2020","date":"Feb 2, 2017 6:03 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab akan menginvestasikan dana sebesar USD 700 juta untuk jangka waktu empat tahun ke depan di Indonesia","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Perusahaan multi-layanan asal Singapura, Grab, memaparkan master plan untuk tahun 2020 lewat event bertajuk Grab 4 Indonesia 2020 di Grand Hyatt, Plaza Indonesia, Jakarta, Kamis, 2 Februari.

Senator Grace Poe, chair of the public services committee, filed Senate Resolution 262 seeking a congressional inquiry into the unfair practice and the need to create standards to limit it. During the holiday season, passengers complained of the unfair price increases, with surge amounts ranging from P2,000 to P28,000. Poe denounced this, saying it is just similar to the “kontrata (contract)” system rampant among regular taxi cabs, which passengers try to avoid by using TNCs. “The surge pricing experienced by consumers is no different from ‘kontrata,’ where cab drivers would demand a fixed and excessively high fare during rush hours and the holiday season,” the senator said in her resolution. She also cited cases in other countries like Australia and the United States, where Uber had been criticized for increasing its fares during disasters and emergencies such as the Sydney hostage crisis and Hurricane Sandy. “Here and in abroad, commuters have complained that sometimes, the ride they requested would suddenly get cancelled, and when they request for a new ride, surge pricing appears,” she added. Congress should craft guidelines While the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has ordered Uber and Grab to limit the fare increases, the senator said Congress should craft guidelines to curb surge pricing. (READ: LTFRB warns Uber, Grab over unreasonable price surge) In pushing this, Poe said lawmakers abroad have already tried to address the problem by proposing “to ban surge pricing or put a cap on it.” In the House of Representatives, a bill has been filed banning the “exorbitant” and “undue” rate surges. A counterpart bill has yet to be filed in the Senate. Senator Sherwin Gatchalian filed a measure in August 2016, but it focused only on the regulation of TNCs, without specific provisions prohibiting unfare price surging. Poe also asked Congress to look into how TNCs have been used by some businessmen to skirt franchising laws and operate a fleet of private vehicles, “resulting in further traffic congestion.” “TNCs should not lose sight that their services are mainly for the convenience of the riding public, which is why they were awarded a certificate of public convenience.” The transportation department’s Department Order No. 2015-11 allows TNCs “to determine their fares in line with efforts to encourage innovation in public transportation in order to increase mobility on major thoroughfares, boost travel time, improve the quality, sustainability and reliability of public transport services, and respond to the needs of the modern commuter.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/157499-ltfrb-rejects-uber-grab-franchise-applications/","title":"LTFRB rejects 15,000 Uber, Grab applications","date":"Jan 5, 2017 11:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Applicants submitted incomplete requirements or did not appear at hearings","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Thursday, January 5, said it dismissed nearly half of franchise applications – over 15,000 out of some 32,000 – for ride-hailing services Grab and Uber. Applicants submitted incomplete requirements or did not appear at hearings, GMA News reported. LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra, in a dialogue with transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) operators in Quezon City, said the dismissed cases would be uploaded to the LTFRB website, “hopefully next week.” The dialogue between the LTFRB and TNVS operators revolved around Memorandum Circular 2016-008, which directed the LTFRB’s technical division and regional offices not to accept any applications for TNVS – particularly those of Uber, GrabCar, and Uhop – proposing to ply the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.

As in years past, the South Korean consumer electronics giant staked out the opening slot in a day rich with back-to-back press briefings by industry titans. LG and rivals touched on hot themes at this year’s show – including robots, appliances equipped with artificial intelligence, and self-driving car technology. A surprise star of the presentation was a strikingly thin LG Signature OLED flat-screen television simply branded “W.” The super high-definition TV measured just 2.57 mm thick in a 65-inch screen model. LG boasted that a larger screen model garnered a CES Best of Innovation Award. “Why the ‘W’?” LG Electronics USA marketing vice president David VanderWaal asked rhetorically during the presentation. “Wallpaper. Window. Wow,” he said. The screens are designed to affix to walls with magnetic brackets, protruding less than 4 mm. Sony OLED shines  Sony used CES to introduce a stunning A1E series Bravia OLED television in a shift to image technology that had been ruled by LG in the US market.  “It renders every detail of an image,” Sony Corporation chief executive Kazuo Hirai said of the new flagship TV at the company’s booth on the CES show floor. “You will see more than you every thought possible in a display.” Sony eliminated speakers from the A1E series, creating technology that generates rich sound by making the screen vibrate in what Hirai boasted to be an industry first. Google’s Android TV software for accessing internet content was also built into the screens, according to the Japanese consumer electronics and entertainment titan. Hirai promised a rising sea of 4K resolution content for high-definition screens. TCL out to grow China’s fast-growing television maker TCL was at the show with a mission to expand its market. TCL unveiled 25 new Roku-enabled TV models heading for North America, boasting improved high-definition imagery and enhanced audio. “We are here today because we are investing in the future of technology, specifically smart TVs,” TCL marketing executive Ranjit Gopi said during a press briefing. “We are, as of 2016, one of the fastest growing brands in the world.” TCL partners include internet powerhouse Google and its Android TV offering. TCL is investing some $7.7 billion in high-quality television screens and is aiming to make the world’s slimmest curved television, according to Gopi. He introduced a new flagship “X” series television that will launch first in China and then be rolled out elsewhere. South Korean consumer electronics giant Samsung unveiled a new 75-inch QLED TV model at its CES press gathering, along with a company-first gaming laptop.  “Despite some challenges, we’ve made big strides in 2016, gaining market share in TVs, home appliances, wearables and smartphones,” said Samsung Electronics America chief operating officer Tim Baxter. “We are delivering on our vision of the future.” Eye-grabbing screens Samsung ramped up its smart TV platform with an offering tailored for sports lovers, and added a new entertainment application. Features in the new models included being able to recognize who is speaking while being commanded by voice. The South Korean device maker also showed off a new television built with “Quantum Dot” technology. Sales of televisions globally have been slipping, a seeming result of viewers turning to smartphones, tablets, and computers for video, according to Steve Koenig, senior director of market research at the US Consumer Technology Association trade group behind CES. Koenig forecast that $105 billion will be spent this year on televisions, down from $108 billion last year. However, those who do buy televisions are expected to prefer 4K high-definition models, with the number of those screens sold jumping to nearly 82 million this year compared with just shy of 53 million last year, according to Koenig. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/156985-duterte-uber-grab-taxis-identification/","title":"Duterte to order Uber, Grab, taxi drivers to display IDs on car seats","date":"Dec 30, 2016 10:49 AM PHT","snippet":"The President wants guidelines issued by January requiring drivers to place enlarged identification cards on car seats so passengers can easily report abuse","body":" MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte will require Uber, Grab, and taxi drivers to prominently display identification cards on car seats to make it easier for passengers to report abuse. “From now on, ngayong January, I’ll issue the regulations. Itong lahat maglagay kayo ng mukha ninyo sa likod ng upuan ninyo, your name, a sort of an enlarged identification card,” Duterte said during a one-on-one interview with Rappler’s Maria Ressa in Malacañang on Thursday, December 29. (WATCH: Duterte: The Wartime President)  (From now on, this January, I’ll issue the regulations. All of you put your face at the back of your seat, your name, a sort of an enlarged identification card.) Apparently, reports of abusive drivers have reached the President who had only harsh words should such exploitation of passengers continue. “Kayong mga taxi driver, you better stop it. Kayo, ‘yung Uber pati ‘yung isa, putang ina, ‘yung, ano ‘yung isa? You stop it. You stop it,” he said. (You taxi drivers, you better stop it. You, Uber, even the other one, son of a bitch what’s the other one? You stop it. You stop it.) Drivers who charge more than they should, based on the meter, are committing the crime of estafa or swindling, Duterte added. It’s not clear if the President is aware of the Uber and Grab app features that provide driver information to passengers and even allow passengers to report wrongdoing to app managers. For him, physical identification cards are an easier way for passengers to note down information necessary to pin down crooked drivers. ‘What if I ride your taxi?’ Duterte also wants passengers to report abuses to the Philippine National Police instead of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) since police have the mandate to discipline criminal behavior. “Don’t go to LTFRB. Those agencies have nothing to do with law and order…Disciplining or forcing peope to obey, not to commit crimes, you report directly to the police and the police will have to act on it,” said Duterte. He acknowledged that many taxi drivers supported his presidential bid and that many of them are honest. For dishonest cabbies, he painted a different scenario, with him as their passenger. “Ano kaya kung magsakay ako sa taxi mo, maglabas ako ng sikreto ng Malacañang? Magsakay ako sa taxi mo tapos ikaw ‘yung naturo na nagrape ng babae, magsabi ako ihatid mo ako doon sa Cavite tapos sabi ko, baba ako dito, ano kaya tingin mo gawain ko sa iyo?” he said.

Winston “Winnie” Castelo has filed House Bill No. 4669 or the No Price Surge Act, banning the “exorbitant” and “undue” ride rate surges by transport network companies (TNCs), like Uber and Grab. Castelo on Monday, December 26 slammed the price surging of Uber and Grab, saying the practice is unfair and predatory for the riding public. This was after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) received complaints about price surges ranging from P2,000 to P28,000 this holiday season. Because of the complaints, Grab and Uber would put a cap to its pricing this holiday season. (READ: After LTFRB warning, Uber PH limits surge until January 15) “The said bill, if approved, will permanently protect the helpless the commuters from undue and exorbitant price fixing by [Uber and Grab],” Castelo said. Aside from banning price surges, Castelo said the bill would also put a cap in the number of vehicles under each TNC. In the Philippines, ride-hailing applications such as Grab or Uber are categorized as TNC. All vehicles under TNC must get permits from the LTFRB, which also grants and denies permits for taxis, buses, and other public transport vehicles. Not different from ‘contracting’ Castelo, who is the chairman of the House Committee on Metro Manila Development, said the price surging “makes Uber and Grab not so different with the much complained taxis that resort to ‘contracting’ instead of using the meter.” “While we thought that these providers serve as a better mode of public transportation for our people, they appear to be just the same with or worse than erring taxi cabs that charge passengers more than what the meter says,” Castelo added. Under the price surge practice, passengers of Uber and Grab can be charged as high as thrice the price of the usual rate when traffic condition is bad and demand for their service is high. “So how does the transport network vehicle service industry now become a friendly alternative each time this unfortunate situation happens to their poor patrons?” Castelo asked. He said “there should be a limit to the number of vehicles to avoid road congestion otherwise our efforts to ease traffic in Metro Manila would be rendered useless.” As the taxi industry has no monopoly of abusive and discourteous drivers, Castelo said he found it necessary for Uber, Grab drivers to undergo proper training. “This will help make sure that they truly make the difference. A polite and smart driver is as important as arriving safely in one’s destination,” the lawmaker said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/156569-ltfrb-grab-cap-holiday-rates/","title":"Heeding LTFRB’s call, Grab puts cap on holiday rates","date":"Dec 25, 2016 3:41 PM PHT","snippet":"LTFRB, meanwhile, gives Uber 48 hours to follow suit","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In compliance with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) order to stop “unreasonable” price surging, ride-hailing company Grab is putting a cap on its ride rates until January 30. “To ensure that the riding public will get the best service and rates during this season, Grab is voluntarily placing a cap in compliance with the LTFRB, on our rates starting December 24 to January 30,” Grab said in a statement. This is after the land transport regulator warned transport network companies Uber and Grab they face suspension or cancellation of their accreditation should the “unreasonable surges” in rates persist this holiday season. The LTFRB said it received several complaints about Uber and Grab surges ranging from P2,000 to P28,000 this holiday season. “For our passengers, may we request that you double check your pickup and dropoff points before confirming your booking. We are ready to refund rides, upon verification, should they be charged for any incorrect rate caused by a system error,” Grab said without disclosing the maximum price for ride rates. Last 2 days for Uber On Sunday, December 25, the LTFRB acknowledged Grab’s immediate action on the warning and called on Uber to follow suit immediately. “Calling Uber, your 25 December 2016 statement does not heed LTFRB’s directives. Please be reminded that LTFRB is your regulatory body. LTFRB is giving you 48 hours to comply,” the land transport regulator said in a statement.

Uber cited the suspension of transport network vehicle service (TNVS) applications since July as a reason for the price surge. “Since the suspension of TNVS applications in July, we have been in frequent dialogues with the LTFRB to find workable solutions to meet the increasing demand for ridesharing options and avoid price increases brought about by disproportionate supply and demand, longer wait times for riders, or having no available cars on the road,” Uber said.

Just before the holiday rush, Uber removed the surge notification – which pops up whenever fares have gone up twice or more – and replaced it with an upfront fare feature similar to GrabCar’s. Uber Philippines general manager Lawrence Cua clarified earlier this week that “fare shock” or discrepancies may arise because of several factors: the route changed, the trip added multiple stops, or the traffic worsened during the trip.

Fitur GrabHitch, atau “Nebeng”, merupakan layanan berbagi kendaraan roda dua untuk masyarakat di wilayah Jakarta dan sekitarnya. “Kami melihat ada peluang untuk mengurangi jumlah kendaraan pribadi yang melintas di Jakarta, makanya kami keluarkan layanan GrabHitch, yakni orang lain dapat nebeng dengan seseorang yang memiliki rute pergi atau pulang yang sama,” kata Managing Director Grab Indonesia Ridzki Kramadibrata saat peluncuran GrabHitch di Jakarta, Rabu.  Caranya? Menurut Ridzki, masyarakat yang akan menggunakan GrabHitch hanya perlu mengisi rute dan jadwal perjalanan dalam aplikasi Grab, untuk kemudian dicocokan dengan jadwal pengemudi, yang akan pergi ke arah sama. “Pengemudi yang memiliki tujuan sama dengan Anda akan menjemput, sehingga yang digunakan hanya satu motor. Ini akan mengurangi jumlah pemakaian kendaraan pribadi,” ujarnya. Berapa tarifnya? Ridzki menyebutkan layanan khusus untuk jarak jauh tersebut akan membuat biaya perjalanan harian penggunanya menjadi lebih efisien karena pada 15 kilometer pertama dikenakan sebesar Rp20.000 dan tarif dasar kilometer selanjutnya hanya sebesar Rp1.000. Apa bedanya dengan GrabBike? “Yang uniknya lagi, GrabHitch dapat dipesan sejak tujuh hari sebelum perjalanan. Jadi Grabhitch ini memang berbeda dengan produk kami sebelumnya, GrabBike,” ungkapnya.

Each of them picked a judge from a fish bowl and answered the question given to them. After a quick break, the 5 candidates were narrowed down to 3 contestants – John Raspados of Baguio City, John Bench Ortiz of Pangasinan, and Christian Khalil Vera Cruz of Zamboanga del Sur. The 3 contestants then were given one question to answer from reigning Mr Gay World winner Roger Gonsalbez of Spain. The question was: “What is most challenging about being gay in the Philippines?”  All 3 expressed their thoughts about trying to fit in and at the same time, fighting the stereotypes against the LGBTQ community. Christian answered: “Being gay in the Philippines is difficult. Especially that we live in a society that is very conservative. However, if you are just true to yourself, and be able to influence others, about our sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression, we can shatter the boundaries, discrimination and therefore, we shall have acceptance without exception.” Bench meanwhile said: “The challenging part of being gay in the Philippines is gaining respect and acceptance. But we will achieve it if we brothers and sisters, gay Filipinos will unite to be responsible Filipinos not only in the Philippines but the world. So come with me, I can be your coach of equality. “ John answered: “I feel for these people who are still challenged not being accepted. And with all the efforts of Mr Gay World, we could somehow eradicate stereotypes, patch [up] our differences, and modernize th image of gay men in the Philippines.  “And somehow, we could create a new image for us to be more confident, more creative, and most especially more accepted.  {source}<iframe width=”100%” height=”360″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/kLzykFwdLnQ” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe>{/source}     After a deliberation by the judges and the final message by Mr Gay World Philippines title holder Christian Lacsamana, the winners were announced, with Christian placing 2nd runner-up, Bench Ortiz as 1st runner-up, and John Raspado as the winner.

It is republished here, with his permission. Rappler live streams Mr Gay World Philippines finals night! Bookmark this page to watch. Truthfully, I have assessed the official candidates over and over again for the past two weeks (more so when I sat on the panel of judges for the pre-pageant segment last September 18) and I could really see the competition among the 34 remaining gay men. These 5 stood out among the rest: John Raspado of Baguio City  This tall and very good-looking candidate has the Mr. Gay World profile written all over his features and qualifications. He can also speak his mind well, and just needs to steady his nerves during crunch time. The title is his to lose, in my opinion. If he fumbles in the most important part of the competition, the next likeliest winner would be… Janjep Carlos of Cavite  This adorable chinito never hides the fact that he went under the knife to achieve the look he now proudly displays to all and sundry. This guy can be a real scene-stealer once you give him the chance to express his innermost self. He can have a way with words, and in a brief and concise manner at that. He is definitely the biggest opponent of the number one on my list, but I wouldn’t discount the plan of attack of… Bench Ortiz of Pangasinan  Bench is cleary the most familiar face in the competition, owing to his widespread popularity as a Fitness Coach among fans and followers of KF Beauty Queens and the camp’s pageant contenders. He definitely exudes a tempered flamboyance that would never go unnoticed. I have always seen him as the Best in Swimwear among all the others. But how far will he go, considering that there could be a silent killer in… Khalil Vera Cruz of Zamboanga del Sur  This corporate yuppie who got his business acumen from the Asian Institute of Management blends his very Pinoy charm with a generous dash of wit and eloquence. And boy, is the most dashing when it comes to suits, tuxes, and smart casual wear. Did I also mention that he is an active voice for the HIV/AIDS awareness campaign, #LoveYourSelf? But wait, there could be one more possible winner in the ranks, and he is… Leo Andrew Ponce of Batangas  Leo is a former business trader turned professional hair and make-up artist, and he can also be a force to be reckoned with. He may not have a look that grabs your attention outright, but he definitely makes up for it in character. His appeal grows on you and stays firmly rooted. He is a vocal LGBTQi [lebian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and intersex] advocate who will always fight for equality and give gay men who discriminate their fellow gay men whiplash. These 5 are my strongest bets for the title and one of them will be our representative to Mr. Gay World 2017. As for the remaining 10 on my list, I would pick two special competitors who may pull a hat trick and surprise everyone come October 2. Sycris Brown of General Santos City and Ron Ramos of Palawan could be real contenders if the right breaks come their way. We’ll just have to wait and see if the cookie will crumble and give way to them entering the spotlight. So for now, my top pick for Mr. Gay World Philippines is John Fernandez Raspado of Baguio City. He’d better deliver because I have a lot of faith in him. He is definitely in it to win it. Allow me now to give a huge thanks to the head and founder of the Mr. Gay World Philippines Organization, Wilbert Tolentino, who has raised the search to the national level with his bravery and daring. He has a maverick personality and he’ll pull out all the stops to make this competition a big success. Kudos as well to his senior team, made up of Raoul Barbosa, Ryan Soto, Rodgil Flores and others for providing solid support from beginning to end. To the successor of Mister Gay World Philippines 2016 Christian Lacsamana, may you inspire even more. See you at the UP Theater this Sunday, October 2. It’s going to be one hell of a show that could approximate Miss Universe proportions. – Rappler.com Norman Tinio started pageant-blogging back in 2009 but has already been an avid pageant enthusiast since the early 70s.

Two foreign Amnesty International staff were scheduled to speak at the launch in Bangkok of a report detailing 74 cases of torture at the hands of Thai soldiers and police.  But the advocacy group was told by labor officials and police on Wednesday that speaking at the event could be grounds for arrest, AI spokesman Omar Waraich told the Agence France-Presse, forcing the group to cancel the conference. “The authorities said to us that… if any representatives from Amnesty International spoke at the event they would be in violation of Thailand’s labor laws,” he said. All of the speakers had valid business visas and were in touch with local authorities before the conference, he added. Junta spokesman Winthai Suvaree said he was not aware of officials’ interference with the event but denied any torture under the military government, which came to power in a 2014 coup. “The information they had on torture was probably 10-20 years old. Their sources might not be trustworthy,” he told AFP.  The report accused the junta of allowing a “culture of torture” to flourish since its power grab two years ago. It described a range of abuse suffered by detainees, including beatings, partial suffocation by plastic bags, strangling, waterboarding and electric shocks to the genitals.  “We documented 74 cases, we also interviewed officials and we came to the sad conclusion that torture is prevalent in Thailand. And as far as military interrogations are concerned, torture is even systematic,” said Dr. Yuval Ginbar, a London-based legal adviser to Amnesty International who came to Thailand to present the report. The United Nations described the findings as “substantive” and hit out at the Thai government for blocking the event.  “This incident is another striking illustration of a new pattern of harassment of human rights defenders documenting torture in Thailand,” said Laurent Meillan, a representative for the UN’s human rights office in Southeast Asia, who was also scheduled to speak at the conference. The junta has severely curbed free speech over the past two years by outlawing all political activities, muzzling the press and detaining scores of critics.  Police and soldiers have been dispatched to break up dozens of rallies and block numerous events covering rights abuses and other politically sensitive topics. Three rights activists behind a landmark report on torture in Thailand’s insurgency-hit south are now facing jail time after the military filed defamation charges against them earlier this year.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/147250-philippines-united-nations-yasay/","title":"Philippines at UN tells world not to interfere","date":"Sep 25, 2016 8:21 AM PHT","snippet":"'Extrajudicial killings have no place in our society, and in our criminal justice system,' says the country's top diplomat","body":" NEW YORK, United States – Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr on Saturday, September 24, pushed back against criticism of President Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war, telling the United Nations not to interfere.  “We urge everyone to allow us to deal with our domestic challenges in order to achieve our national goals, without undue interference,” Yasay told the UN General Assembly. There has been growing international alarm over the rising death toll from Duterte’s crackdown on crime, with human rights groups saying that security forces are engaging in extrajudicial killings. Duterte won elections in a landslide in May after vowing to eradicate the illegal drug trade in 6 months, and promising that 100,000 criminals would be killed in the process. Since he took office on June 30 about 3,000 people have been killed, about a third of them suspects shot dead by police and the rest murdered by unidentified attackers, according to police statistics. “We have not and we will never empower our law enforcement agents to shoot-to-kill individuals suspected of drug crimes,” the foreign secretary told the General Assembly. “Extrajudicial killings have no place in our society, and in our criminal justice system,” he added. The top diplomat told the General Assembly that Duterte enjoyed a 92% approval rating at home for his stance and suggested that his campaign was misunderstood. “Our actions, however, have grabbed both the national headlines and international attention for all the wrong reasons,” he said. He argued that corruption and drugs had “torn apart many of our communities, destroyed our families and snuffed out the hopes and dreams of our people – young and old – for a bright future.” Invoking the UN’s new sustainable development goals adopted last year, Yasay said his country would not be able to meet those goals without tackling corruption and drugs. Relations between Duterte and the United Nations have been tense after the newly-elected leader launched several tirades against the world body for its criticism of his tactics, even threatening to pull out – a threat he later withdrew. Earlier this month, Duterte declined a meeting with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on the sidelines of a meeting in Laos of Southeast Asian leaders. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/147026-kontroversi-iklan-grab-pilih-aman/","title":"Jadi kontroversi, Grab pangkas durasi iklan #PilihAman","date":"Sep 22, 2016 3:50 PM PHT","snippet":"Menurut Grab, iklan ‘Pilih Aman’ bertujuan untuk meningkatkan kesadaran tentang standar keselamatan berkendara di Indonesia","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia — “Menjijikkan,” “nyeremin,” “tidak etis,” “itu iklan zombie atau pelayanan?” – adalah segelintir dari sekian banyak respon miring terhadap iklan video Grab terbaru di Indonesia. Setiap perusahaan tentu saja tidak ingin menerima respons bernada negatif seperti itu, terlebih jika iklan tersebut merupakan bagian dari kampanye yang mengedepankan rasa aman pengguna.    Iklan yang merupakan bagian dari kampanye #PilihAman milik perusahaan layanan pemesanan transportasi asal Malaysia ini menampilkan seorang remaja perempuan bernama Dinda yang sedang berjalan. Tiba-tiba sebagian tubuh Dinda terbalut luka dan darah seperti baru saja mengalami kecelakaan. Ia terlihat seperti zombie. Banyak tukang ojek yang mencoba memanggilnya, tapi Dinda memilih membuka aplikasi Grab dan memesan ojek melalui GrabBike. Dan anehnya, tubuhnya kembali normal saat ia menaiki ojek yang dipesan dari aplikasi tersebut. Alur cerita dan voice-over dari iklan ini seolah memperingatkan bahwa jika Dinda memilih ojek lain maka ia akan mengalami kecelakaan. Dengan memilih GrabBike, ia bisa aman. Tapi apakah memang aman? Banyak orang mempermasalahkan iklan ini karena dua hal. Pertama, mereka berpendapat bahwa iklan ini sebaiknya tidak perlu menampilkan gambar yang mengerikan seperti itu. Kedua, klaim Grab yang mengatakan bahwa layanannya lebih aman dibanding layanan ojek lain juga masih dipertanyakan kebenarannya.  Grab sendiri sebenarnya tidak luput dari riwayat kecelakaan. Tahun lalu, pengemudi GrabBike yang tengah membonceng seorang penumpang mengalami kecelakaan. Saya sendiri pernah mengalami kecelakaan kecil saat menggunakan layanan GranBike – untungnya hanya berupa luka lecet.  Meski begitu, saya tidak melaporkannya karena sadar bahwa itu tidak sepenuhnya kesalahan pengemudi. Saya yakin pasti kejadian seperti ini juga banyak dialami penumpang lain. Iklan Grab diakhiri dengan pernyataan bahwa seluruh pengemudi GrabBike lulus pelatihan keselamatan berkendara. Pelatihan ini sendiri menyaratkan pengemudi untuk memiliki dokumen seperti SIM. Motor yang mereka gunakan juga harus menjalani pemeriksaan teratur. Layanan pemesanan ojek online lain juga sebeneranya sudah memberlakukan prosedur serupa. Bagaimanapun, kecelakaan masih saja sering terjadi. Layanan sejenis seperti GoRide dan UberMotor juga tidak luput dari insiden tidak mengenakkan ini. Tidak ada data yang cukup untuk menyimpulkan apakah prosedur keselamatan berkendara bisa menjadi jaminan mutlak bahwa motor yang digunakan bisa menjadi pilihan yang aman. Kita bahkan tidak tahu berapa banyak ojek tradisional yang mengalami kecelakaan, karena mereka tidak terdaftar secara resmi. Menurut data dari Korps Lalu Lintas (Korlantas) Polri, 27.000 orang meninggal di jalan karena kecelakaan pada 2015. Sebagian besar kecelakaan tersebut melibatkan kendaraan bermotor roda dua. Jadi, bisa disimpulkan bahwa terlepas ojek mana yang kita gunakan, mode transportasi yang satu ini memang berisiko kecelakaan tinggi. Iklan yang ‘tidak punya perasaan’ Iklan #PilihAman juga mendapat kecaman karena dinilai menggunakan “rasa takut” sebagai alat untuk menarik perhatian konsumen kepada layanan Grab. Ini bukan kali pertama Grab mengalami isu terkait iklan yang mereka tayangkan. Pada 2015, iklan Grab “Love boobs?” yang ditujukan untuk meningkatkan kesadaran terhadap kanker payudara, juga mendapat kritik pedas dari masyarakat. Video iklan #PilihAman di YouTube sempat berubah menjadi private dan kini telah dipangkas durasinya menjadi jauh lebih pendek.  Berikut adalah penjelasan dari Marketing Director Grab Indonesia, Mediko Azwar: “Kampanye iklan ‘Pilih Aman’ Grab bertujuan untuk meningkatkan kesadaran tentang bagaimana standar keselamatan berkendara bisa ditingkatkan di Indonesia. Kami berharap video iklan ‘Pilih Aman’ bisa menstimulasi pemikiran – guna mendorong orang untuk lebih peduli terhadap tingkat keamanan dan pelayanan ojek yang mereka kendarai sehari-hari. Video tersebut mendapat reaksi yang beragam dan kami berterima kasih kepada semua orang yang telah membagikan umpan balik mereka. Kami paham video tersebut menimbulkan ketidaknyamaman dan dipandang mengerikan bagi sebagian orang. Kami berharap bahwa mereka yang telah menyaksikan video ‘Pilih Aman’ akan mengerti bahwa niat kami bukanlah menakut-nakuti, tapi menggambarkan konsekuensi yang mungkin terjadi jika kita mengkompromikan standar keselamatan. […] Kami telah mengganti versi asli dari video iklan tersebut. Kami berharap masyarakat akan fokus pada pesan inti yakni untuk meningkatkan keselamatan berkendara bagi seluruh rakyat Indonesia.” —Rappler.com Artikel ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di Tech in Asia."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/146763-grab-raises-750m-investors/","title":"Ride-hailing firm Grab raises $750M from investors","date":"Sep 20, 2016 12:51 PM PHT","snippet":"The new investments led by Japan's SoftBank Group raises the Singapore-based firm's total capital to more than $1.0 billion","body":" SINGAPORE – Ride-hailing startup Grab said Tuesday, September 20, it has raised $750 million from investors to expand in burgeoning Southeast Asian markets including Indonesia, as it aims to build its lead over US-based rival Uber in the region. The new investments led by Japan’s SoftBank Group raised the Singapore-based firm’s total capital to more than $1.0 billion, it said in a statement. Competition between Uber and local startups has grown fierce in Southeast Asia, home to more than 600 million people and a rising middle class. Grab is considered the leading ride-hailing platform in the region, operating in nearly twice as many cities as Uber, with the startup claiming up to 1.5 million bookings a day. Singapore state investment agency Temasek Holdings was an early investor in the firm.  Grab said participants in the recent round of fundraising included both new and existing investors which it did not name, but reports last month said China’s Didi Chuxing was among those planning to back the firm. The two companies are already partners in an alliance that also includes India’s Ola and US-based Lyft Inc, allowing users to book rides while traveling to a country covered by any of the 4 apps. Grab chief executive and co-founder Anthony Tan said the latest investment was “the largest in the history of Southeast Asia consumer technology”. “We are particularly excited about the growth opportunity in Indonesia, where we see an almost US$15 billion market for ride-hailing services alone,” he said. The move follows Uber’s decision to sell its business in China to Didi Chuxing last month, ending a ferocious battle for market share that cost both firms billions. Grab operates in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Its core product platform includes private cars, motorbikes and taxi-hailing services which are rapidly gaining popularity in the region.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/146011-kartilya-restaurant-masterchef-asia-filipino-contestant-lica-ibarra/","title":"Everything we ate at Kartilya, a new restaurant from a Pinoy MasterChef Asia contestant","date":"Sep 17, 2016 6:40 PM PHT","snippet":"A year after finishing 9th on the first season of MasterChef Asia, Lica Ibarra is serving up Filipino classics in Metro Manila","body":" MANILA, Philippines – A year after MasterChef Asia season 1, former contestant Lica Ibarra is back in the kitchen and is serving up Filipino classics right in Metro Manila. Lica, who was one of 3 Filipino home cooks who competed on MasterChef Asia in 2015, is now the executive chef of Kartilya, a new restaurant in Bonifacio Global City. It wasn’t a project she jumped into right away, though. After the show, Lica, a single mom, went back to her job in banking: “Financially, I wasn’t ready yet. But I saved up and after a year, I told myself that I cannot stay in the corporate world after having that whole experience of Master Chef Asia, sayang lang talaga (it would be such a waste),” she told Rappler on September 8. Inspired by the Kartilya ng Katipunan – a guidebook for members of the Philippine revolutionary society of 1892 – and her family’s recipes handed down from generation to generation, Lica’s creations are classic with a twist. Kartilya’s menu is peppered with dishes like arroz caldo ala risotto, sinigang na taro, and Lica’s ticket to MasterChef Asia, the queso de bola bibingka souffle. Others, like her lola’s kare-kare, have stuck to the exact same family recipe – her lola orders the kare-kare every time she visits, just to check. Here are a few more dishes from Kartilya, which we tried on September 8. Pinais na alimasag (P350)  Served in crab shells, this dish of crab meat, coconut meat, and coconut cream mix was inspired by Lica’s travels to Malaysia. Liempo questo fundido (P290)  One of Lica’s partners had suggested that Lica create something similar to a dish he tried in Korea, served with a cheese dip. Lica’s take: pork belly with a 3-cheese mornay sauce, all torched to finish. Corned beef kansi (P390)  Lica says her kansi, is special to her because she taught herself how to cook it from scratch, based on her memories of what it tasted like when she tried it in Bacolod for the first time. ” it was one dish that I really, really, really loved. I couldn’t – it was mind-blowing. The first spoon I had of kansi, I really wanted to take it home and make my own version,” she told Rappler. Kartilya’s kansi, made with corned beef, lemon grass, native tomato, kamisa, jack fruit, and green finger chili all in a sour beef broth is described as a mix between bulalo and sinigang. Boneless bangus (P390)  A dish based on a family recipe, Lica says this is how her lola would serve bangus: topped with a lot of fried garlic and ensaladang manga. Kartilya “Dirty Rice” (P165)  Grab a bowl of plain rice to go with everything, or try the “Dirty Rice:” Kartilya’s special seasoned rice with spring onions and garlic chips. Carioca ng Kartilya (P245)  These sweet rice flour balls come with with your choice of white chocolate, dark chocolate, or ChocNut filling, served with a coconut milk dipping sauce. Queso de bola bibingka souffle (P280)  Kartilya’s signature dessert was inspired by Christmas. Lica, who grew up cooking with her lola, mom, and aunt, told Rappler that she’s always the one assigned to dessert whenever they had family reunions. She decided to make something different one Christmas but still stick the usual bibingka, and she eventually created her ticket to MasterChef Asia. It took Lica 4 tries to get the recipe right, she said, but now all it takes to try her bibingka souffle is a 15-minute wait that’s totally worth it. Home-made tostados (P195 each)  The beef kaldereta, pulled pork, and sisig tostados, each ordered separately, are great paired with with cocktails by Proudly Promdi (P220 each).

This is the first time that an Asia Pacific championship of the half ironman is held here in Asia which has gathered the biggest field in pro triathletes at more than 30. The pros field is also the most competitive so far with Australia’s Tim Reed returning for the second time in the Philippines to defend his title in the Asia Pacific Championship. Reed is in condition to retain his Asia Pacific title which he clinched in Auckland, New Zealand last year as he recently completed a full distance ironman in first place in his native Australia last May. He first competed in the Philippines in last year’s IronMan 70.3 Philippines, grabbing the first place by just a few seconds ahead of close friend and fellow Australian Tim Van Berkel, who will likely be his closest pursuer in Sunday’s race. Van Berkel himself is coming from a first place finish in the full distance Ironman Asia Pacific in Cairns. Equally strong contenders are Canada’s Brent McMahon, and Australians Craig Alexander and Sam Betten. Other pros in the contest are Australia’s Leon Griffin, Bradley Kahlefeldt, Alexander Polizzi, David Mainwaring and Jake Montgomery; New Zealand’s Matthew Franklin, Cameron Brown and Braden Currie; France’s Anthony Costes and Sebastian Jouffret; Great Britain’s Eric Watson and James Hadley; USA’s Brad Williams, Italy’s Jonathan Ciavatella and Denmark’s Jens Petersen Bach.

Steffen has not missed an Ironman race in Cebu since it started here in 2012. Having won a half Ironman 20 times and the Asia Pacific twice Steffen is indeed a formidable foe and the favorite to once again take home the top plum this Sunday. Hoping to put a dent in Steffen’s record are Australians Dimity Lee-Duke, Kathryn Haesner, Sarah Crowley and Amanda Wilson; Russia’s Radka Vodicova; New Zealand’s Amelia Rose Watkinson; Spain’s Judith Corachan Vacquera while the Philippines’ lone entry will be Kim Kilgroe, a national team member of triathlon. This will be Kilgroe’s second ironman race. Aside from the pros men and women contest, there will also be a Filipino elite category which is an equally exciting contest among the locals, and the age group categories. The race will have participants swimming 1.9 kilometers in the waters fronting Shangri-La Mactan’s Resort and Spa, then bike 90 kilometers from the resort to the cities of Mandaue, Cebu, Talisay and back for the last segment of the race, which is a 21-kilometer run from Shangri-La towards Punta Engano and back to the finish line. To keep participants safe, road closures will be implemented in the 4 cities. Also, for the first time, the event will have a live stream via www.ironman.com. Also spicing up the race are celebrities who will be competing as well such as Dingdong Dantes, Piolo Pascual, Matteo Guidicelli, Kim Atienza, Paul Jake Castillo, Ivan Carrapiette,Team Pangilinan and Gilbert Remulla. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/141517-jason-day-stunning-putt/","title":"WATCH: Jason Day sinks stunning putt to grab share of PGA lead","date":"Jul 31, 2016 9:29 PM PHT","snippet":"Jason Day sinks a 72-foot birdie putt from way downtown","body":" SPRINGFIELD, USA – Top-ranked defending champion Jason Day sank a stunning 72-foot birdie putt at the sixth hole Sunday, July 31 to grab a share of the lead at the rain-soaked PGA Championship. Australian star Day was still playing his third round when he holed the wonder putt to reach eight under par, level with Americans Robert Streb and Jimmy Walker atop the leaderboard at a saturated par-70 Baltusrol. But his feat came as the fourth round began, the seldom-seen move of two simultaneous rounds being played without redrawing the pairings in a bid to finish on time Sunday. Preferred lies – a rarely seen move in majors allowing players to lift, clean and place the ball – were adopted by the PGA of America for the final round for any “closely mown area through the green” in another bid to battle the rain and finish Sunday despite more storms in the forecast. Day, Streb and Walker were among those girding for a 36-hole fight at the year’s final major tournament under rain and overcast skies as 11 others were within 3 shots of the lead. “You’ve got to be a little bit aggressive,” Day said. “It should yield a few more birdies, but also stay patient with regards to the weather, just keep yourself mentally intact.” British Open winner Henrik Stenson of Sweden and Argentina’s Emiliano Grillo were on seven-under in the third round while South African Brendan Grace birdied 4 of his last 6 holes to fire a 66 and grab the 54-hole clubhouse lead at 6-under 204. “It’s going to be a long day,” Stenson said. “I don’t know if it’s a benefit or not, not having started. But it’s the same for everyone in the last groups. It will be a long day. It’s normally the mind that gives up before the body.” Streb, who missed the cut at the year’s first 3 majors, has not managed a top-10 finish in a US PGA event since his share of 10th at last year’s PGA Championship – 27 events of mounting frustration that could end with him hoisting the Wanamaker Trophy. “I’m guessing we’re going to be here ’til at least Monday, hopefully not Tuesday,” Streb said. “But we’ll see how it goes. Still got to play 36 holes, see how many we get in.” In all, 37 of 86 players were able to finish the third round Saturday with American Kevin Kisner completing a 65 to stand 5-under. “There’s going to be people that play (only) 18 holes like Kevin Kisner and he’s going to have a little bit more of an advantage,” Grillo said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/140531-ltfrb-suspends-uber-grabcar-applications/","title":"LTFRB suspends processing of new Uber, Grab, Uhop applications","date":"Jul 22, 2016 12:16 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) As of July 15 this year, the transportation department says applications for transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) units rose to 29,151","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) –  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB)  has suspended accepting and processing applications for Uber, GrabCar, and Uhop in Metro Manila. The LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular 2016-008 on Thursday, July 21, directing its technical division and regional offices not to accept any applications for transportation network vehicle services (TNVS), particularly those of Uber, GrabCar, and Uhop proposing to ply the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.  Transportation Spokesperson Cherie Mercado said the circular was issued due to the rising volume of TNVS applications and the department’s review of the fare scheme. As of July 15 this year, the transportation department said applications for TNVS units rose to 29,151. The department said there are 5,727 pending applications for GrabCar units, 23,292 for Uber units, and 131 for Uhop units. In October last year, TNVS applications were only at about 3,500. LTFRB said the suspension of TNVS applications will take effect once the circular is published in at least one newspaper. Second time This is the second time the government has suspended accepting TNVS applications. In December 2015, a Quezon City court ordered the government to stop accepting Uber and GrabCar applications for 20 days. This was after the LTFRB faced complaints on the accreditation of TNVS, particularly the issue of oversupply of Uber and GrabCar units. Uber Technologies, Incorporated said it respects the decision of LTFRB, but asked the agency to “maintain the spirit of Department Order No 2015-011.” “We respect the decision of the LTFRB to suspend the acceptance and processing of new TNVS applications. However, this decision also impedes our goal to get more people into fewer cars,” Uber said in a statement released Friday, July 22. “We ask the LTFRB to maintain the spirit of Department Order No. 2015-011 that was meant to promote innovation, reliability, and consumer choice in mobility so that we can all help solve the problem of traffic congestion together,” the service provider added. Grab Philippines echoed Uber’s remarks. “Grab respects the decision of the LTFRB on revisiting the policies of TNVS…We are hopeful that the playing field will be leveled among all transport providers and that this will direct the focus on providing the best passenger and driver experience,” it said in a statement. “Thousands of aspiring TNV operators will be affected by this latest development, along with the thousands of passengers who rely on our services daily. At the moment, there is still more demand for our services than supply and the capping of applications will only take away an alternative for individuals who want to earn extra or those who want to improve their livelihoods,” Grab added. In May last year, the transportation department issued the department order, creating 4 new transport categories: TNVS, Premium Taxi, Airport Bus, and Bus Rapid Transit. These are meant to ease traffic congestion “through efficient use of road space.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/137898-europeans-asians-battle-for-un-security-council-seats/","title":"Europeans, Asians battle for UN Security Council seats","date":"Jun 28, 2016 2:21 PM PHT","snippet":"Five non-permanent seats are up for grabs in the vote at the UN General Assembly, but two are all but decided","body":" UNITED NATIONS – Three European countries and two Asian nations are battling for seats on the UN Security Council in elections on Tuesday, June 28, that are drawing attention to the refugee crisis and human rights. Five non-permanent seats are up for grabs in the vote at the UN General Assembly, but two are all but decided. Ethiopia and Bolivia are running unopposed after their regional grouping put them forward as their candidates, but they must still pick up 2/3 of votes cast in the 193-nation assembly. Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden are competing for two spots while Kazakhstan and Thailand are squaring off for a seat reserved for Asia. On the eve of the vote, Human Rights Watch called on UN member-states to take a cold, hard look at the human rights record of Kazakhstan and Thailand. Thailand’s military junta, which seized power in May 2014, has banned political activity and ramped up prosecutions under tough sedition and royal defamation laws. “Thailand’s pledges to lead the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide as a Security Council member ring hollow in the face of its widespread abuses at home,” said HRW’s deputy director for global advocacy, Philippe Bolopion. Vying for a council seat for the first time since its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan has been criticized for cracking down on journalists and political activists. “Debate happens in UN corridors in New York in a way that is not allowed in Kazakhstan itself,” Bolopion said. Italy takes migrants to UN Italy has lobbied fiercely for a council seat, portraying itself as a crossroads country in the Mediterranean and touting its experience dealing with the refugee crisis. “Italy is a global security actor,” said Italian Ambassador Sebastiano Cardi during a recent election debate. “We think we are ideally placed to deal with the peace and security issues on the agenda.” Italy is also seen as a player in efforts to pull Libya out of chaos. The Netherlands, home to the International Criminal Court and other world tribunals, has played up its commitment to international justice while Sweden has highlighted its role as a major aid donor. Italy and the Netherlands have a “very good chance of winning” seats, said David Malone, rector of the United Nations University. “Surely Asia, with many governments focused above all on economic and social development in often creative and highly successful ways, can do better” than Thailand and Kazakhstan, he said. The 5 elected countries will begin a two-year stint on the council on January 1, taking their seats alongside the five permanent council members – Britain, France, China, Russia and the United States. As the most powerful body of the United Nations, the Security Council can impose sanctions, endorse peace accords and authorize the use of military force. It also oversees 16 peacekeeping missions in the world, with a budget of about $8 billion. Winning a Security Council seat “is a great PR victory for governments to their constituents,” said Martin Edwards, who teaches UN and global governance at Seton Hall University. The challenge is finding space to influence decisions that are mostly in the hands of the five veto-wielding members. “They’ll have the chance to speak but some states speak more loudly than others,” said Edwards. The other five non-permanent members are: Egypt, Japan, Senegal, Ukraine and Uruguay. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/135426-southeast-asia-travel-budget-guide-itinerary/","title":"Southeast Asia budget guide: 4 countries, 23 Days, P33,000 all in","date":"Jun 5, 2016 9:15 PM PHT","snippet":"A detailed budget itinerary by traveler Jayson Concepcion shows the complete expense breakdown of his trip, which cost him P33,000 for a full 23 days of travel","body":" Dreams will always be dreams unless you actually do something to achieve it. This is what I always remember every time I want to achieve something in life. Five years ago when I was working in Vietnam (I was no traveler back then), my Filipino friend and officemate invited me to travel to the Cambodia-Vietnam border to check out the casinos (I didn’t gamble) and food there. While waiting in queue at the immigration line, I noticed that there were lots of foreign travelers lining up, including their kids. My friend said they were backpacking and further explained that some of them taught English from one country to another to sustain their long-term travels. Well of course you all know that teaching English is not the only way to earn money while backpacking. Fast forward to some years later, I got bitten by the travel bug. I remembered that time in the border. I researched in it, read lots of articles and blogs on traveling Southeast Asia then actually traveled to Thailand and back to Vietnam for 5 days each. I was hungry for more.  Then the opportunity came that I could have a one-month break from the corporate jungle. I instantly recognized it and booked the flights immediately; we went on a trip around Southeast Asia for 23 days.  This dream of mine has now come true and I would like to share how we did it. In this post you will see our budget, itinerary and guides so you can plan your trip, too. Our route  Our route is not the common backpacking route that you see in other guides or blogs. In this trip we skipped Vietnam since 1.) I’ve already worked there in Ho Chi Minh last 2011 2.) We went back in HCM last 2014 3.) I wanted to see other places in Vietnam besides HCM so I’m saving that trip for a different backpacking route sometime in the future, hopefully. Ours is a combination of Indochina destinations plus Singapore and Malaysia. Please see route below: I wish we could’ve squeezed Batam, Indonesia in the mix too, but I’ve already booked our AirBnb stays in Malaysia and SG so it was a no-go for now. Next time. Itinerary In this trip, we wanted to focus more on Thailand so we allotted 14 days in Thailand alone, but please note that we didn’t do much temple touring in Thailand as we already did that in our first trip back in 2014. And we all know Singapore is an expensive country, so we just stayed there for 2 nights. We stayed in the airport on the first night since our arrival in Changi was around midnight. You will also notice that there are days that are not as packed because it’s either we were in the market or food-tripping or just simply resting and saving money. Day 0  Day 1   Day 2 Day 3 Day 4  Day 5  Day 6  Day 7  Day 8  Day 9  Day 10 Day 11  Day 12  Day 13  Day 14  Day 15  Day 16  Day 17  Day 18  Happy Songkran! Day 19  Day 20  Day 21  Day 22  Day 23  Transportation Compared to other backpacking routes, I think ours is more expensive as we needed to fly to SG from Manila then fly from KL to Phnom Penh. Plus we booked a round trip flight to Chiang Mai from Bangkok (heard of derailing trains but we could’ve tried the night bus instead). Anyways, here are the modes of transportation we used to go from one country to another. I will detail the transportation for each country in their separate posts. We carried 50L and 35L backpacks. Both are allowed as carry-on baggage so we didn’t check it in anymore. Manila to Singapore Airline: Cebu Pacific Fare: P3199.5 each (no check-in baggage) A little expensive for low promo fare standards because I booked this just 2 months before our trip. As I mentioned earlier, this trip was kind of unexpected. Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Since we stayed in Yishun, we opted to go to Kranji station which is in the same line and 5 stops away. So go to Kranji station, board the purple orange buses SBS 170. It will drop you at the immigration to exit SG. Fare 1.75 SGD. Once your passport is stamped, board a bus going to Johor Bahru (SBS 170 or the Yellow bus). Fare 1.5 SGD. Enter Malaysia immigration. Board SBS 170 again to go to Larkin Terminal to ride a bus to KL or other parts of Malaysia. Fare 1.80 SGD. In Larkin Terminal, there are lots of buses going to KL. Just choose the cheapest. We paid 30RM each from Larkin to TBS Terminal in KL. Don’t worry, cheaper here doesn’t mean your bus is a hellhole. We rode a nice air-conditioned bus with ample legroom and the driver was not a speeding maniac either. Kuala Lumpur to Phnom Penh, Cambodia Airline: Air Asia Fare: P1409.26 each (no check-in baggage)  Phnom Penh to Siem Reap Night Bus: Giant Ibis Fare: $15 + $1 online processing fee This is a sleeper bus and if you are sure with your date of departure or schedule, then it’s better to book it online so you can reserve your bed. Yes, your bed inside the bus. It was comfortable and they have a decent toilet (Use it only when you really need to). It also gets really cold inside the bus. They do provide blankets but it may not be enough so we put on our jackets while sleeping. Siem Reap to Bangkok Bus + Mini-van combo: Capitol Tours (capitoltourscambodia.com) Fare: $10 Travel Time: 9 hours including immigration exit/enter at the border The bus was ok, but the mini-van is a little cramped. They have Wi-Fi on board though. At the border, they will give you a sticker. Don’t ever lose that sticker. Stick it on your shirt. After exit in Cambodia (right side), you go to the left side of the Thailand border for immigration entry. Once finished, the Capitol tours staff will look for people with the sticker that was given to you. They will guide you to the terminal near 7/11 where you will take the van. If you are planning to take only a bus/van/taxi to Poipet (Cambodia border), then you can just look for a bus/van in the terminal/car park near 711 in Aranyaprathet (Thailand border). I have read guides that you can also hop on a casino bus to Bangkok from here. Bangkok to Chiang Mai (Roundtrip) Airline: Air Asia Fare: P3,427.01 each (no check-in baggage) If you want to lessen your expenses and wouldn’t mind travelling for long hours (I think 10 hours or so), you can also take a night bus from Bangkok and vice versa. Fare ranges from 500 to 600 THB. Almost all guesthouses and hostels offer this. You can just approach the receptionist. Bangkok to Manila Airline: Cebu Pacific Fare:  P4557.11 each (no check-in baggage) Same reason with our flight to SG. A little expensive for low promo fare standards. Accommodation Below is a quick list where we spent our nights. N = night(s) e.g. 1 night is 1N Singapore: 1N Changi Airport Entertainment deck – Free 1N Airbnb in Yishun Ave 11 c/o Poh Heng Anthony Malaysia: 3N AirBnb in Jalan Enggang c/o Hairuddin Phnom Penh: 1N Top Banana Hostel  Siem Reap: 2N Rosy Guesthouse Bangkok (First 3 nights): Lamphu Guesthouse (2N) Lamphu Guesthouse (1N) Chiang Mai: Julie Guesthouse (3N) JJ Guesthouse (2N) Bangkok (Last 6 nights): Lee Travel Inn (4N)  Lee Travel Inn (2N) TIP: If you’re traveling during summer to these countries, then consider booking air-conditioned rooms as much as possible. Some hostels and guesthouses’ fan rooms can’t cope with the heat just like in Rosy Guesthouse in Siem Reap. We felt like we were inside an oven there. Tours We didn’t book many tours in our trip. Almost all of the places we went to are DIY trips and free (or with cheap entrance fee). Some don’t require you to hire a cab/tuktuk because you can just walk to it which we mostly did. I’ll just list below the key places we went to for each country and insert some helpful remarks. Please also note that we didn’t do much “touring” in Bangkok as we already did that in our last trip there back in 2014. Singapore: Raffles Place/Fullerton Hotel vicinity, Merlion Park, Esplanade, The Helix, Marina Bay Sands Hotel vicinity  Gardens by the Bay Malaysia Petronas Twin Towers Batu Caves  Phnom Penh Killing Fields and S21 Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum Siem Reap Wat Preah Prom Rath Angkor Wat/complex Short cycle tour   Bangkok Wat Saket (Golden Mount)  Songkran Festival  Chiang Mai Wat Phra That Doi Suthep  Doi Pui Village Wat Chedi Luang and Wat Phan Tao Thai Cooking class by Asia Scenic  Food In this Southeast Asia trip, just like in our previous trips, we were also focused on eating and trying different kinds of dishes along the streets, bus terminals, hawker stalls and food courts. There were just times that we had to buy biscuits or bread in convenience stores/street for tomorrow’s breakfast since most of the shops/food carts aren’t open early in the morning. We like to be up early and eat immediately so we needed fast access to our food. Singapore: Where else? Hawker stalls of course! Luckily, there are hawker stalls near our accommodation in Yishun. We had an amazing Char Siew Noodle for 4SGD and Roasted Chicken rice for 3SGD.  Just eating in these Hawker stalls will let you experience the food and culture of Singapore. Malaysia (KL): The very first time we tried Malaysian food is in Larkin Bus Terminal. It was a Roti Telur for breakfast for just 2.2 RM! It already includes a big delicious curried chicken breast. In KL, you can have amazing food in food courts like the ones in KL Sentral, KLCC mall and Central Market. We love their Nasi Gorengs or any of their fried rice dishes! A dish usually cost around 4 to 6RM. Pretty cheap for such delicious dishes. Don’t forget to try their Teh Tarik (hot milk tea) / Teh Sejuk (cold milk tea) too.  Of course, there are also those mom and pop eateries and street food in the sidewalks of KL. We had the best mee hailam (6RM) just a 3 minutes walk from our accommodations! It is a noodle based dish with vegetables and seafood drenched in dark soy-oyster based sauce. Fantastic dish! For breakfast, lots of vendors are selling Roti Canai, an Indian-influenced flatbread where you can dip in curry sauce. Amazing food, so be sure to grab one of those. Malaysian food is usually spicy but very delicious. Even if you don’t like spicy food, I’m sure you’ll appreciate the taste. Their fried rice dishes are not that spicy anyways especially the Nasi Goreng Cina that is more like a Yang Chow. And if you are looking for pork, you’ll find that they seldom sell pork dishes there as they are predominantly a Muslim country. Cambodia: In all honesty, we didn’t like Cambodian cuisine that much. Compared to their neighboring countries Thailand and Vietnam, theirs pales in comparison for us.  They have a dish that is similar to Com Tam in Vietnam. It is composed of white rice, grilled pork, fried egg, soup and condiments. It was good and cheap ($1) but compared to Com Tam, theirs are on a different level. We also tried their traditional Khmer dishes. First in the list is Fish Amok ($2.25). Again, it’s ok but nothing spectacular about it. After our Angkor Wat tour, we found a mom and pop eatery and ordered another set of Khmer dishes. We ordered a Beef Lok Lak ($3) and Cambodian salad ($2.5). The saving grace of our food trip in Cambodia was in the night market (near the river) at Phnom Penh. It was street food galore! You choose your food from the stalls then you let them cook it while you sit in one of the mats laid there. It was a fun experience though every stall there is no different from one another. But hey, even the locals love it! We loved it!  And oh, beer at Pub street in Siem Reap is ridiculously cheap at half a dollar! Thailand: What we love about Thailand is you can almost get delicious food everywhere! Here’s our take on some of the foodie places we went to: Soi Rambuttri/Khao San Road – Lots of Pad Thai stalls ranging from 30 to 60 TH and eateries offering Thai food in the 40 to 80 THB range. If you had enough of Thai food, then there are several Western restaurants catering to big spenders. You can also check the nearby streets for noodle soups, fruits, etc. Chiang Mai Walking street night markets – nice street food there. Lots of variety. Stalls near Chiang Mai gate also offers Thai dishes. Terminal 21 food court – oh my, the best ever! Dishes here are very cheap ranging from 25 to 50 THB! And cheap doesn’t mean they aren’t delicious because they are! Lots of variety too. We dined here like 4 or 5 times. The food court in MBK is no match to T21 when it comes to price and quality. MBK food ranges from 45 to 100 THB.  Chatuchak Weekend Market – nice variety of street food and Thai dishes. There’s always a refreshment stall nearby because it can get very hot during midday! Soi Convent in Silom – When we visited, there weren’t too many stalls. But we still managed to eat some street food like fried shrimp spring rolls and fried chicken with tamarind dipping sauce. We didn’t like Hoi Tod that much though. Of course, there are your trusted mom and pop eateries everywhere. Just take a look at what they offer and if it looks good, then eat it! Expense summary Here is a summary of our Expenses in our 23 days Southeast Asia backpacking trip. Please note that shopping items and souvenirs were not included as this may vary per individual preferences.  Also not included is our travel insurance of P2,358 per person; insurance is recommended, not required. Food and drinks were shared between the two of us. I will further expand the details of expenses in my separate post for each country. Please note that I converted the currency to Philippine pesos using www. xe.com.  For 32,756.44 per person for 23 days with flights in between, it’s definitely not bad. You can even lower it further by taking the bus to Chiang Mai, squeezing your travel to 10 to 15 days or just doing Vietnam-Cambodia-Thailand instead. Also note that we didn’t do much temple-hopping in Bangkok since we did that already in 2014 where we visited the Grand Palace and its neighboring Wats and the Ayutthaya-Bangpa-In Palace combo. – Rappler.com Jayson Concepcion is a programmer by profession but has a soul of a traveler.

Trudeau apologized a 3rd time in two days in the Commons for his actions, and said he would accept any sanctions imposed on him by a parliamentary committee tasked with reviewing the incident. “I regret my behavior yesterday,” he said. “It should absolutely not have happened.”  “I am prepared to accept the decision of the committee and to respect the will of this house,” he added. But his contrition failed to satisfy opposition MPs, who accused him of “arrogance and blatant disrespect.” Trudeau had crossed the floor of the House late Wednesday, May 18, pushed through a crowd of Conservative and New Democratic Party (NDP) MPs and grabbed opposition Tory whip Gord Brown by the arm, dragging him toward his seat. As Trudeau reached for the whip, parliamentary video showed he elbowed NDP MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau in the chest. Green Party leader Elizabeth May said that a subsequent heated exchange between Trudeau and NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, as the fracas was unfolding, had come close to fisticuffs. “Things are very bad in the House. Nearly a physical altercation between Mulcair and Trudeau,” she said in a Twitter message. Tensions had been rising in parliament over a deadline to pass legislation on assisted dying. The Supreme Court struck down a prohibition against doctor-assisted suicide and gave Ottawa until June 6 to draft new legislation that would permit consenting adults with serious health problems to end their lives. “Time is running out,” Elizabeth May noted. Opposition parties sought to scuttle a key vote on the bill using delay tactics, including obstructing the whip, which led the government to threaten the use of its majority to push through the legislation. Tory leader Rona Ambrose blamed the kerfuffle on the Liberal government’s attempts to cut off debate on the bill, effectively “putting a straitjacket on parliament.” “The government doesn’t want an opposition anymore,” she said. “They just want an audience, which led to last night’s events.” Ambrose accused Trudeau, a boxer in his spare time, and prime minister only since November, of gross misconduct. “I watched him as he grabbed the official opposition whip by the arm,” she said in parliament. “I also watched him as he yelled something so out of line that I will not repeat it in the House. I watched him as he collided with the member who was clearly shaken by his behavior and left this House,” she said. “He was out of line. He had no business on this side of the House. He had no business anywhere but in his own seat. Everything he did from the moment he rose from his seat was unnecessary, and it was unsettling.” – Michel Comte, AFP/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/133472-rappler-forbes-philippines-leading-startups/","title":"Rappler in Forbes Philippines’ list of top tech startups","date":"May 20, 2016 8:51 AM PHT","snippet":"Forbes Philippines in its May 2016 issue ranks the country's well-known Internet startups by gross revenue","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Two e-commerce shops, a listed mobile technology provider, and a social news network are among the Forbes Philippines’ list of leading startups by gross revenue. In its May 2016 issue, Forbes Philippines ranked the country’s well-known Internet businesses by gross revenue, and those that got the top 3 spots are Lazada E-Service Philippines, Incorporated; Yondu, Incorporated (Entertainment Gateway Group); and BF Jade E-Services Philippines, Incorporated (Zalora). I-Remit, Incorporated; Xurpas, Incorporated; Chikka Philippines, Incorporated; Level Up! Incorporated; Rappler, Incorporated; and MetroDeal, Incorporated also joined the list of top startups, ranked according to gross revenue in 2014. Lazada Riding the Philippines’ e-commerce boom, the online shopping site (based on page views per visitor daily, according to Web analytics source Alexa.com) has topped the magazine’s list of leading startups. Incorporated in 2012, Forbes reported that its gross revenue went up by 71% to P1.07 billion in 2014. Although its revenue grew by more than a half, Lazada still registered a net loss of P975.2 million in 2014. Its marketplace model allows merchants to compete with their prices, with the final amount sometimes falling lower than what some of these retailers offer offline. Entertainment Gateway Group The mobile content provider that was sold to Globe Telecom, Incorporated based on a valuation of $8 million ranked second in Forbes Philippines’ top startups list. Yondu in 2014 saw its gross revenue surge by 41% to P853.9 million, and its net income increase by 26% to P250.6 million. In September 2015, Xurpas invested P900 million to acquire a 51% stake in Globe’s Yondu. The investment is meant to solidify their partnership in the Internet and digital space.  Xurpas and Globe said they will transform Yondu into a regional arm for digital content distribution and other technology-driven services. Yondu develops mobile content, and provides mobile and information technology services. Zalora Zalora Philippines’ operator BF Jade E-Services ranked 4th in Forbes’ list, reporting 2014 gross revenue of P465.9 million. This is almost double the revenue it reported in 2013. Just like Lazada, Forbes said Zalora reported a net loss of P532.9 million in 2014 despite the surge in revenue. Since its incorporation in 2012, the company has been testing different methods to broaden its reach. The Zalora pop-up store is the one of the latest ventures in the company’s young history. “Since we started operations in 2012, we’ve continued to look for innovative ways to grow e-commerce in the Philippines, and through this initiative, we hope to widen our customer reach, educate them on the benefits of online shopping, and dress them in the latest fashion trends in the quickest way possible,” Zalora Philippines Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Paulo Campos had said. I-Remit The remittance firm is among the oldest of the bunch, incorporated in 2001.  When the company made its debut on the Philippine Stock Exchange in 2007, I-Remit was 5 times oversubscribed. The company priced the initial public offering at P4.68 per share. In 2014, Forbes said I-Remit’s gross revenue decreased by 6% to P453.6 million, while its net income slid by 43% to P23.4 million. Xurpas Securing the 5th spot, Forbes reported that Xurpas saw its gross revenue increase by 64% to P331.8 million, and its net income by 57% to P174.7 million in 2014.  The listed mobile technology provider has announced more than 8 investments since it raised P1.24 billion from an initial public offering (IPO) in December 2014.

It’s the first time the service – known as uberPOOL – has been offered in Southeast Asia and continues Uber’s expansion in Indonesia, one of its fastest-growing markets worldwide. The carpooling function will match passengers in the same area traveling in the same direction, enabling them to split the fare by sharing the car. Although it adds travel time, Uber says carpooling fares can be 25% cheaper than their regular service. Drivers also benefit as they collect more passengers for each journey. “Every seat is an opportunity to make money,” Uber’s regional general manager for Asia-Pacific Mike Brown told reporters. “It starts to become as competitive as taking a bus.” If it takes off, Uber believes carpooling could ease traffic in the sprawling capital, routinely ranked among the world’s worst. The scheme has proved popular elsewhere, with 20 million uberPOOL trips made every month in China, company data shows. In San Francisco, nearly half of all Uber trips are shared by passengers. US company Uber, one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, has high hopes for Jakarta. A combination of poor public transport, notorious traffic gridlock and high smartphone use by tech-savvy citizens has seen the popularity of ride-hailing apps explode in recent years. The launch of uberPOOL came just weeks after the start-up introduced a motorbike taxi service in Jakarta. The contest between Uber and its rivals – chiefly local startup Go-Jek and Southeast Asian company Grab – has been fierce. New services are constantly being offered and prices kept low, as the competing outfits battle for the millions in Jakarta who rely on their service every day. Like in other parts of the world, all have met with resistance from traditional taxi companies, who complain the tech-based services operate illegally and threaten their livelihoods. Thousands of taxi drivers staged a violent protest in March, blocking major roads in the capital, clashing with rivals and setting tyres alight. Uber meets with government officials on a weekly basis to ensure it is meeting local regulations, a process Brown said “is going very well”. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/132584-kerjasama-gojek-blue-bird/","title":"Kerjasama Go-Jek dan Blue Bird, menyaingi GrabTaxi?","date":"May 10, 2016 2:46 PM PHT","snippet":"Akankah Go-Jek dan Blue Bird membuat layanan serupa GrabTaxi?","body":"  Pada akhir Maret 2016 , para pengendara angkutan umum yang didominasi oleh pengemudi taksi, melakukan aksi demonstrasi menuntut penutupan layanan transportasi berbasis aplikasi.  Dalam aksi tersebut, para supir taksi bahkan sempat terlibat aksi adu pukul dengan para pengendara sebuah aplikasi ojek online, Go-Jek. Namun insiden tersebut ternyata tidak sampai membuat Go-Jek sebagai perusahaan ikut memusuhi perusahaan taksi. (BACA: Sopir taksi bentrok dengan pengemudi Go-Jek dan GrabBike) Go-Jek dan perusahaan taksi terbesar di Indonesia, Blue Bird, mengumumkan bahwa mereka akan menjalin sebuah kerjasama strategis, pada Senin, 9 Mei.  Melalui siaran pers, Go-Jek dan Blue Bird mengatakan kalau kerjasama ini akan meliputi aspek teknologi, sistem pembayaran, dan promosi. Kerjasama tersebut akan berfokus pada peningkatan layanan transportasi melalui mobile solution yang mudah dan nyaman untuk pelanggan Go-Jek dan Blue Bird di seluruh penjuru nusantara.  Apa sebenarnya bentuk dari kerja sama yang terkesan misterius ini? Go-Jek dan Blue Bird sama-sama bungkam Meski sudah mengirim siaran pers ke media, namun pihak Go-Jek bungkam dan mengatakan bahwa kerjasama lebih lanjut akan dijabarkan oleh kedua pihak dalam waktu dekat. Hal yang sama disampaikan oleh Teguh Wijayanto, Head of Public Relations dari PT. Blue Bird. Teguh mengatakan bahwa pihaknya belum bisa memberitahukan mengenai kerjasama tersebut karena masih dalam tahap finalisasi. Namun Teguh menjelaskan kalau Blue Bird akan tetap mempertahankan layanan pemesanan lewat aplikasi bernama My Blue Bird yang mereka miliki.  “Pada bulan Mei ini, kami akan meluncurkan ulang aplikasi My Blue Bird dengan tampilan yang lebih segar dan user friendly dengan berbagai fitur terbaru. Salah satu fitur terbaru kami adalah sistem pembayaran non-tunai,” kata Teguh. Akankah Go-Jek dan Blue Bird membuat layanan serupa GrabTaxi? Setelah menjadi salah satu pemain besar di bisnis ojek online, Go-Jek pun ikut meluncurkan layanan pemesanan mobil seperti UBER dan GrabCar yang bernama Go-Car.  Hal itu membuat mereka mempunyai hampir semua layanan yang disediakan oleh pesaing mereka, yaitu UBER dan Grab. Satu-satunya layanan milik Grab yang belum dimiliki Go-Jek hanyalah layanan GrabTaxi. Oleh karena itu, kemungkinan paling besar dari kerja sama tersebut adalah munculnya layanan pemesanan taksi Blue Bird lewat aplikasi Go-Jek. Kemungkinan ini bertambah besar karena dalam menyediakan layanan GrabTaxi, Grab telah menjalin kerja sama dengan Express Group, yang merupakan pesaing berat dari Blue Bird. Hal ini pun sesuai bila kita melihat penjelasan Go-Jek dan Blue Bird kalau mereka akan bekerjasama dalam aspek teknologi, sistem pembayaran, dan promosi.  Munculnya layanan pemesanan di Go-Jek jelas akan membantu Blue Bird dari sisi teknologi dan promosi. Untuk soal pembayaran, kemungkinan para pengguna akan bisa membayar dengan layanan non-tunai milik Go-Jek, yaitu Go-Pay. Mari kita tunggu bagaimana sebenarnya bentuk kerjasama antara Go-Jek dan Blue Bird ini, serta nama yang akan mereka gunakan.  Semoga saja kerja sama ini bisa membuat konflik antara transportasi konvensional dan transportasi berbasis aplikasi bisa mereda, dan pelanggan pun akan diuntungkan dengan kehadiran layanan yang memuaskan. —Rappler.com Tulisan ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di Tech in Asia."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/132513-marcos-spox-robredo-cheating/","title":"VP race: Marcos camp insinuates cheating as Robredo grabs lead","date":"May 10, 2016 5:19 AM PHT","snippet":"Senator Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos' camp asks the Comelec for a breakdown of the unofficial results","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Reelectionist ABAKADA Party-list Representative Jonathan dela Cruz expressed worry over what they said was possible cheating after Camarines Sur Rep. Leni Robredo overtook Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr in the vice presidential race. At past 3am Tuesday, May 10, Robredo snatched the top spot in the vice presidential race by a slim margin of at least 500 votes.  “While the country is sleeping, we have seen a steep degree of his lead from one million to now trailing by 500 votes,” Marcos’ campaign adviser told reporters in a briefing. Dela Cruz wants the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to provide their camp a breakdown of the votes, stressing that the surge of votes for Robredo “came out of the blue.” “We do not know where these votes are coming from,” he also said.  Asked what would be their camp’s next action, dela Cruz implied that they will call on the Comelec to stop releasing the unofficial results. “The unofficial count may confuse the public because we have an official count, and if the unofficial count doesn’t tally with the official count” there will be a problem, said dela Cruz. Marcos’ confidence on winning the elections slowly eroded Monday evening when he said he did not have a “comfortable lead” over Robredo. He said that he will only be relieved when he takes his oath, noting that it has been hard to identify the source of votes transmitted. His camp said that based on reports, they are uncertain what specific areas or provinces are the votes coming from. The son and namesake of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos was leading the race by over a hundred thousand when transmission of results began just minutes after the polls closed at 5pm Monday, May 9. By the middle of the transmission, the margin grew by almost a million until it again shrank to a few hundred thousand. By 5:08 am Tuesday, Robredo led by 36,876 votes (13,014,447 for Robredo, 12,977,571 for Marcos).  Marcos, in the days leading to the election, has rallied his supporters to guard their votes after receiving reports of discrepancies in the voting receipts of his supporters abroad during overseas absentee voting. He has also slammed the Liberal Party for “conditioning” the minds of voters when he lost the top spot to Robredo in the last ABS-CBN survey. Robredo’s camp, however, denied his accusation. Robredo’s camp, meanwhile, earlier warned the Marcos camp to not condition the minds of the public with “false accusations.” “Let’s all be reminded that it is not impossible that the majority of our people don’t want an unrepentant Marcos back,” a statement from the Robredo camp said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/132448-captain-america-us-box-office-lead-jungle-book/","title":"‘Captain America: Civil War’ grabs US box office lead, overtakes ‘The Jungle Book’","date":"May 9, 2016 5:02 PM PHT","snippet":"'Civil War' overtakes 'The Jungle Book' in the US box office, grossing $181.8 million in its opening weekend","body":" LOS ANGELES, USA – The latest rock-’em-sock-’em Captain America film has vaulted past Disney’s The Jungle Book at the North American box office with a strong debut weekend take of $181.8 million, industry data showed Sunday.

While the tragedy was certainly news, its root cause is nothing we haven’t heard before: the farmers have been hit by a massive drought triggered by El Niño. The drought destroyed their crops, depleted their income, and caused them to go hungry. El Niño is a natural phenomenon now being worsened by climate change. We cannot stop El Niño, but we can do something about climate change. Choosing not to do anything has grave consequences.  Severe disasters For the Philippines, that means drastic changes in warming and rainfall levels. In other words, droughts will be more intense and frequent. Typhoons and flooding, too. In fact, we’re already feeling the effects. What’s happening in Kidapawan is case in point. It’s also not long ago when Typhoon Yolanda (international codename Haiyan), the world’s strongest storm to make landfall in recent history, tore through a large portion of the country. The devastation from that typhoon catapulted the Philippines to the top of the list of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, based on the annual Global Climate Risk Index of Germanwatch. The nation’s position improved, moving to the 4th spot this year, but still among the most vulnerable. The country’s vulnerability is made worse by poverty, its lack of knowledge and means to protect itself, and its inability to cope and manage its surroundings. That level of vulnerability has serious implications: damage to the economy, food insecurity, loss of livelihood, and deaths. Former climate change commissioner Naderev Saño said that a destructive typhoon season could cost the country two percent of its gross domestic product and another two percent for reconstruction.  A global effort  The vital question now becomes: how do we slow down climate change? The simple answer will be to cut our greenhouse gas emissions, the most common of which is carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gas emissions come from our own activities – from taking the car instead of walking short distances to large scale ones like massive deforestation. Greenhouse gases in our atmosphere trap heat, warming the climate. Yet slowing down climate change is not at all simple. It is a global problem. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the main international scientific body assessing climate change, said in a 2014 report that global emissions from manmade activities are “now higher than ever.” “Concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have all shown large increases since 1750 (40%, 150% and 20%, respectively),” the report said. The biggest increase happened between 2000 and 2010. Bulk of the increase came from the energy sector (47%), followed by industry (30%), transport (11%) and building (3%). Other emissions came from the agriculture forestry and other land use. China has eclipsed the US as the world’s top emitter of greenhouse gases, accounting for 17.15% of the global tally. The US contributed 14.9%. A global problem should therefore be addressed by global efforts. That’s why on April 22, 175 countries, including the Philippines, signed the Paris Agreement, a deal that mandates both developed and developing countries to drastically cut their respective greenhouse gas emissions. The collective goal is to keep our global temperature below 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius this century.  Coal dependency  The Philippines’ emissions are smaller compared to developed nations, but they are without a doubt on the rise, surging by 65.6% from 1990 to 2010. Given the country’s extreme vulnerability to climate change, it only makes sense that it lowers its emissions. As part of its commitment to the Paris Agreement, the Philippines set a 70% reduction in emissions by 2030. It cited where its emissions currently come from: energy, industrial processes, agriculture, land use change and forestry, and waste. Naturally, the reductions will also come from these sectors, except agriculture and including transport. However, even with this promise, the country continues to boost its reliance on coal-fired power plants, which are major greenhouse gas emitters. Greenpeace earlier reported that the Department of Energy (DOE) approved over 20 more coal plants, which will start operations by 2020. Different sectors have called out President Benigno Aquino III for his vocal support for coal, having even attended the inauguration of the plant built by the Aboitiz group in Davao early this year.  The DOE also said it would not put a cap on coal plant projects, barely a month after Al Gore, a top crusader against climate change, said that the Philippines should shy away from such plants. But the country can still turn this around – by making good on its promise under the Paris Agreement. One of the key things in the agenda is to shift the country’s energy mix in favor of renewable energy. The presidential election on May 9 will be crucial. Except for Davao city Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, the four other presidential candidates – Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago, Vice President Jejomar Binay, DILG Secretary Mar Roxas, Senator Grace Poe –  said they will support the move toward renewable energy. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/130460-payung-hukum-angkutan-online-mengkhawatirkan/","title":"Grab: aturan baru bisa menimbulkan kekhawatiran","date":"Apr 23, 2016 9:38 AM PHT","snippet":"Grab mengatakan aturan Kementerian Perhubungan tentang angkutan online menimbulkan kekhawatiran.

Aturan tersebut tertuang dalam Peraturan Menteri Perhubungan Nomor 32 tahun 2016. Salah satu perusahaan angkutan online, Grab, mengatakan masih mengkaji peraturan baru ini. “Saat ini kami masih merujuk kepada peraturan sebelumnya dalam memastikan mitra koperasi kami memenuhi semua arahan dari pemerintah,” kata Managing Director Grab Indonesia, Ridzki Karmadibrata melalui siaran pers yang diterima Rappler pada Jumat, 22 April 2016. Terkait aturan baru ini, Ridzki mengatakan ada sebagian isi peraturan yang bisa menimbulkan kekhawatiran. Salah satunya pada model bisnis dan kerja sama dengan pihak pengemudi.

Berikut isi Permenhub nomor 32 tahun 2016:  Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Darat Kemenhub Pudji Hartanto menjelaskan beberapa perubahan yang tercantum. Pertama, untuk menyelenggarakan angkutan umum tidak dalam trayek, seperti mobil rental, perusahaannya wajib mempunyai izin yang dikenakan penerimaan negara bukan pajak (PNBP). Perusahaan yang dimaksud juga harus berbentuk badan hukum Indonesia, yaitu BUMN, BUMD, perseroan terbatas atau koperasi. “Persyaratan untuk memperoleh izin adalah memiliki lima kendaraan yang dibuktikan dengan STNK atas nama perusahaan,” kata dia. Alasannya, kendaraan angkutan berbasis aplikasi daring sebagian besar merupakan kendaraan pribadi. Karena itu, STNK-nya juga atas nama pribadi.  Mobil semacam ini harus diubah kepemilikannya menjadi STNK atas nama badan usaha. Aturan tersebut ditetapkan untuk mengantisipasi apabila pemilik tak lagi bergabung dengan perusahaan. “Saat itu ia bisa mengambil kembali kendaraannya, dan mengambil STNK pribadi lagi,” kata dia. Perusahaan juga harus memiliki pool, fasilitas perawatan kendaraan yang dibuktikan dengan dokumen kepemilikan atau perjanjian kerja sama dengan pihak lain. Untuk pengemudi yang dipekerjakan sesuai dengan golongan kendaraan. Syarat-syarat tersebut adalah akta pendirian, bukti pengesahaan sebagai badan hukum, tanda daftar perusahaan (TDP), surat izin tempat usaha (SITU), surat pernyataan kesanggupan sebagai pemegang izin dan pernyataan kesanggupan menyediakan fasilitas pemeliharaan kendaraan.  Dia menambahkan dalam rangka pengawasan, perusahaan penyedia aplikasi harus melaporkan profil perusahaan, memberikan akses pengawasan operasional pelayanan, data perusahaan yang bekerja sama, data kendaraan dan pengemudi, serta layanan pelanggan berupa nomor telepon, email dan alamat perusahaan kepada Direktur Jenderal.  “Jika terjadi pelanggaran akan diberi sanksi berupa pembekuan sampai dengan pencabutan kartu pengawasan kendaraan bermotor,” katanya.-dengan laporan dari Antara/Rappler.com BACA JUGA:   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/130372-gojek-nasionalisme-uber-grab/","title":"Strategi Go-Jek ingin tarik pengemudi Grab dan Uber dapat kritik tajam","date":"Apr 22, 2016 9:38 AM PHT","snippet":"Go-Jek mengklaim perusahaannya memiliki jiwa nasionalisme","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia — Pendiri Go-Jek, Nadiem Makarim mengajak, pengemudi Uber dan Grab untuk bergabung dengan perusahaannya.

The Filipino-Australian Day fired a two-under par 69 in challenging, windy conditions at Harbour Town Golf Links in Hilton Head, South Carolina. He shared the lead on six-under par 136 with Americans Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell, who both posted 68s. The top trio were one stroke in front of another 3 players that included overnight co-leader Luke Donald, who carded a 71, Scotland’s Russell Knox (65) and American Patton Kizzire (68). Day, who had bogeyed the last hole on Thursday to drop out of a share of the lead, said gusting winds on Friday made life difficult. “It would be 20 miles per hour and then suddenly die down,” Day said. “Very, very tough day out there. I’m glad I got it in at two-under.” Day, who teed off on 10, finished with 4 birdies and two bogeys. His bogey at the par-five fifth, his 14th hole of the day, came after he hit out of bounds trying to hit a draw around the dogleg. “I was just trying to sling a draw around the corner, and got way too far on the inside and got stuck and just plugged it way right,” Day said. It was a mental mistake, Day said, the kind that can creep in after the kind of tough major championship campaign that he slogged through at Augusta National last week. “I felt like I went 10 rounds in a championship fight (at the Masters). It just beat us up, physically and mentally. “I may be a little mentally fatigued but there’s no excuse. I’ve got to focus,” added Day, who went into the Masters off back-to-back wins at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the WGC Match Play. Former world number one Donald, who shared the first-round lead with South Africa’s Branden Grace, bounced back from a double-bogey at his fifth hole of the day, the par-three 14th, picking up two birdies in his last nine holes to post an even par round. “I didn’t quite have it today, especially on the front nine,” Donald said. “”I was searching a little bit in my swing. “But I really grinded it out pretty well, got some good up-and-downs and played a really solid front 9 coming in.” Eighty-two players made the halfway cut.

The partnership produced the OpenTraffic Initiative, launched on Tuesday, April 5. It is designed to provide real-time data to traffic management agencies and city planners. The open source platform uses GPS data taken from smartphones in Grab’s vehicles and translates it into traffic statistics which include speeds, flows, and delays at intersections. This is done real-time with data transmitted every 6 seconds. The data is then compiled in the OpenTraffic platform where information can be used by government agencies to study critical areas in traffic management. These areas include peak hour analysis along key streets, travel time reliability, and street vulnerability to bad weather and traffic accidents.  “If governments can see precisely what traffic congestion looks like in the Philippines, it can alleviate its impact by optimizing traffic signals, revising the planning of public transportation routes and schedules, and making effective decisions for implementation of key infrastructure such as overpasses,” said Deevya Desai, Grab’s regional head of public affairs, at the platform’s launch. In addition, Grab and the World Bank plan to integrate another open source tool called DRIVER, by late May, which will provide real-time notifications of traffic incidents to government agencies. The application is designed to help governments identify and prioritize cash-prone areas and allow for faster response times. While the Philippines was chosen as the initial country to pilot the project, Grab and the World Bank plan to eventually make it available to all governments throughout Southeast Asia. “Through this initiative, the Philippines will leapfrog traditional approaches to road safety, traffic management, and planning,” said Holly Krambeck, senior transportation specialist at the World Bank.  From calculators to Excel sheets The newly launched platform will be made available to the government at zero cost. The World Bank and the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) have trained 200 government staff from different agencies to use it. The initial agencies with personnel trained include the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), Philippine National Police (PNP), Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), and the Cebu City Transportation Office “As they say whoever controls information controls decision-making. Once you have timely and reliable info, then decision-making and implementations become easy,” said DOTC Undersecretary for Planning Rene Limcaoco. Limcaoco said the agencies will initially use the data to focus on travel patterns and durations so that they can get an accurate picture of where the demand for transportation is and to which specific destinations. With that information, he added, “the government can then plan and implement through the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), more responsive public transportation policies and/or new rules.” The upgrade was needed because, until recently, the government’s major source of traffic data came from manual surveys. Limcaoco pointed out that these surveys ran the risk of being obsolete once completed due to the length of time needed to conduct them. “It’s like moving from manual calculators to Excel,” he said. Real-time data, however, is not a panacea to all of the country’s data collection woes, according to Ricardo Sigua, director of the UP Institute of Civil Engineering. It is a good indication of the level of usage of roads but to fully understand traffic, other variables involved such as traffic law and density should also be considered, he explained. “Most of the data for this platform will be gathering from Grab drivers which is a subset of road users. To have an overall assessment of what’s going on, on the road, we need to complement this project with other activities,” Sigua said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/128311-usvote-wisconsin-primaries/","title":"Wisconsin up for grabs as Trump, Clinton seek upsets","date":"Apr 5, 2016 2:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and top Democrat Hillary Clinton are seen as underdogs against their never-give-up rivals","body":" WASHINGTON DC, USA – Wisconsin takes center stage Tuesday, April 5, when the Midwestern state votes in the US presidential primary race, with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and top Democrat Hillary Clinton seen as underdogs against their never-give-up rivals. The potentially pivotal contest is the first after a 10-day lull in the process that determines the parties’ nominees for the November general election, with Trump’s main rival Senator Ted Cruz eyeing the Badger State as a crucial firewall against the celebrity billionaire’s march to an outright nomination win. “If we do well here, folks, it’s over,” he claimed at a campaign stop Monday, April 4, in the town of La Crosse. Like Trump, Clinton risks losing Wisconsin, where she faces a surging Bernie Sanders, who has won 5 of the last 6 contests. But April could ultimately prove a sunny month for the former secretary of state, who leads Sanders by double digits in New York, which votes April 19, and Pennsylvania, which casts ballots a week later. Trump, the 69-year-old real estate mogul from New York, also leads handily in those states. The birthplace of the Republican Party, Wisconsin is seen as Ground Zero for the anti-Trump movement. Halting him there would bolster Cruz, the 45-year-old conservative senator from Texas. For Cruz, “it’s a very important win. For Trump, it’s not a critical loss,” University of Iowa professor Timothy Hagle told Agence France-Presse. However, Trump has been in damage control this past week. Although his campaign had recently seemed bulletproof, his latest controversial statements – on abortion, Cruz’s wife and a journalist who said she was roughed up by Trump’s campaign manager – have further alienated women voters, polls indicate. ‘He treats everyone equal’ With polls showing Cruz leading in Wisconsin, Trump’s wife Melania – a former model of Slovenian origin – joined him Monday at the Milwaukee Theater for a rare campaign trail speech, part of a likely effort to boost flagging support among women. “He’s fair,” insisted Melania Trump, 45.  “As you may know by now, when you attack him, he will punch back 10 times harder,” she said, but added: “No matter who you are, man or a woman, he treats everyone equal.” Trump doubled down on some of his recent controversial recent – that the United States should consider leaving NATO and that Japan should be responsible for its own nuclear defense. He also offered a fresh economic doomsday prediction. “We’re going to go into a massive recession,” he warned. “But I also say, if I’m president that’s not going to happen.” The winner of Tuesday’s Republican primary will take most of the 42 delegates on offer. If Cruz wins, he will claim the victory as a turning point in the race, although he will have to struggle to overcome his delegate deficit. Currently, Trump has 739 delegates, Cruz, 466 and Ohio Governor John Kasich, 145, according to CNN’s tally. A candidate needs 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination outright. Trump on Monday called for Kasich to “get the hell out” of the race. But Kasich has refused, insisting he would be the logical mainstream choice in the event of a contested convention in July. Trump predicted he could sew up the nomination before the confab in Cleveland. “I think we’re going to get there on the 1,237 if you want to know the truth,” he said. Cruz was also positive, telling Wisconsin voters that “our campaign still has a clear path” to crossing the delegate threshold before the convention. Some experts contested that assertion. “There’s no chance he can get to 1,237,” veteran election watcher Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia said of Cruz. “It’s simply a matter of whether Trump gets to 1,237. If he does, it’s over,” he added. “If he doesn’t, then we go on to other ballots (at the convention) and anything can happen.” Clinton meanwhile spent Sunday, April 3, and Monday morning in New York, returning only Monday night to Wisconsin, a possible sign of how she sees her chances there. “Between you and me, I don’t want to get Hillary Clinton more nervous than she already is,” Sanders quipped to voters in Janesville. “She’s already under a lot of pressure.” “So don’t tell her this, but I think we win here,” he added, “we win in New York state, we’re on our way to the White House.” Grass-roots enthusiasm for the self-proclaimed democratic socialist remains high. Sanders out-fundraised Clinton in March, pulling in a stunning $44 million in donations against her $29.5 million. But he faces an uphill struggle. In order to prevail, he would need to win at least 60% of all remaining delegates. – Michael Mathes, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/127808-poe-front-runner-pulse-asia-presidential-survey-march/","title":"Poe is front-runner in latest Pulse Asia poll","date":"Apr 1, 2016 10:10 AM PHT","snippet":"(4th UPDATE) The results of the latest commissioned survey show that 3 in 10 Filipinos would vote for Senator Grace Poe if elections were held during the polling period","body":" MANILA, Philippines (4th UPDATE) – Senator Grace Poe regained her poll front-runner status in the presidential race, according to the latest Pulse Asia  Research, Incorporated survey released on Friday, April 1. In the ABS-CBN-commissioned survey conducted from March 15 to 20, Poe obtained a voter preference rating of 28%, up 2 percentage points from her rating in the previous poll. “Nearly 3 in 10 Filipino registered voters (28%) would elect Senator Grace Poe as the country’s next president if the May 2016 elections took place during the survey period,” said Pulse Asia president Ronald Holmes. Her running mate, Senator Francis “Chiz” Escudero, has also topped the voters’ preference poll on vice presidential candidates, along with Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and Vice President Jejomar Binay, the United Nationalist Alliance standard-bearer, were statistically tied for second place. Duterte’s rating is at 24%, down by 1 percentage point, while Binay’s rating improved to 23%, a 1-percentage point increase. Administration standard-bearer Manuel “Mar” Roxas II, with a preferential rating of 19%, lost 1 percentage point. Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago got a preference rating of 2%, down 1 percentage point. Barely two months before the May 9 elections,  4% of registered voters remained undecided on their presidential bets. This is 1 percentage point lower than in the previous poll.  Regional, socioeconomic class preferences Poe is still the top choice in the rest of Luzon with a rating of 35%, up 1 percentage point, while Roxas has kept his lead in the Visayas where 37% of voters favor him, a 1-percentage point gain. Duterte remains the top choice in his bailiwick, with a rating of 43% among Mindanao voters though this is a 3-percentage drop from his previous rating. Poe and Duterte share the lead in Metro Manila with 31% and 30%, respectively, both up by 1 percentage point. The lady senator and the mayor also share the lead in the well-off Class ABC (30% and 32%, respectively), and Class D (27% and 25%, respectively). The poorest Class E favors Poe (30%) and Binay (28%).  Poe still top 2nd choicePoe continued to be the preferred second choice for voters should their primary candidate withdraw from the race (29%).Binay, Duterte, and Roxas were next with essentially the same second-choice presidential voter preferences – 18% for Binay and 15% for the other two. The latest poll results also showed that if Poe drops out of the race, Binay and Roxas would gain the most: 25% of her original voters would choose the Vice President, while 22% will opt for Roxas.Almost two out of every 10 Filipino registered voters (17%) do not identify a second choice for president,” Holmes said.  The last day of the survey period, March 20, was the day of the second presidential debate in Cebu City. It was unclear, however, whether the latest numbers reflected public sentiment on the debate which began past 6 pm and lasted for over two hours. Among the major issues during the survey period, conducted a week after the Supreme Court voted to allow Poe to run, were the joint motion for reconsideration seeking to disqualify Poe, and UNA’s defense of Binay following an Anti-Money Laundering Council report that he allegedly got billions of pesos from infrastructure projects while he was Makati mayor. The Senate also began its probe into the $81-million Bangladesh bank heist during the survey period. The nationwide survey, conducted among 4,000 registered voters, has a ±2% error margin at the 95% confidence level. Subnational estimates for the geographic areas covered in the survey have the following error margins at 95% confidence level: ±4.6% for Metro Manila, ±2.3% for the rest of Luzon and ±3.4% for Visayas and ±3.3 for Mindanao. Bets react Poe thanked her supporters and said the latest poll numbers will inspire her to campaign harder, especially after it was observed that the favorable SC ruling on her case did not give the expected huge boost to her ratings. ‘Yan ay nagpapatunay lamang na kailangan pa natin talagang magtrabaho at marami talagang mga bigatin din na tumatakbo. Ang importante naman sa akin ay maipaabot ko ang mensahe na tutulungan natin ang mga nangangailangan….Ang gusto natin ay malinis na gobyerno laban sa korapsyon,” she told reporters in an interview. (It just proves that we need to work harder, as there are other heavyweights running. What’s important to me is to get by message across: help the needy, and a clean government that will fight corruption.)Rico Quicho, UNA campaign spokesperson, said Binay’s rise in the latest survey is the fruit of the Vice President’s “direct campaign” strategy.“Umangat si Vice President Binay, na nagpapahiwatig na may epekto ang pangangampanya niya nang diretso sa taumbayan. Kaya sa darating pang mga araw ay pag-iigihan pa natin ang paglapit sa mga tao upang ihayag ang kanyang plataporma para maiangat sa kahirapan ang ating mga kababayan,” he said. (Vice President Binay’s rating rose, which indicates that his direct campaign to the people is effective. In the coming days, we will step up this strategy so he can relay his platform to lift the people from poverty.) The Duterte camp said it is pleased with the latest numbers, especially in vote-rich Metro Manila. “Metro Manila and Cebu are battlegrounds and we are happy with our numbers there,” said national campaign manager Leoncio Evasco. Evasco said, however, that the race remains tight, and surveys only serve as “guideposts” for campaign teams and are “not really infallible.” “Everyone is within striking distance. The race is still up for grabs…The presidential race is nearing the finish line and we expect a shake-up in the voter preference as each candidate works hard for victory,” he added. The Roxas camp remained unfazed by the latest survey results. “One thing is clear in the latest survey of Pulse/ABS-CBN: Our countrymen continue to make up their minds and the race remains close. As time passes, more and more people listen to Mar Roxas’ message of continued prosperity,”  said Akbayan party-list Representative Ibarra Gutierrez, Daang Matuwid coalition spokesman. “In the last 39 days of the campaign, our message will rise above the slander and slurs that our rivals continue to spread. In the end, the truth shall prevail,” Gutierrez added. – Rappler.com Editor’s note: In an earlier version of this story, there were some differences in our rendition of Table 3 with the one sourced from Pulse Asia.

A. Barata. In response to the order of government, Grab’s Indonesian unit said it was already working with a local Indonesian partner. “Grab is now trying to ensure that our partner can and will follow every requirement from the government,” said Ridzki Kramadibrata, managing director of Grab Indonesia.  There was no immediate comment from Uber. Ride-hailing apps are being blamed by taxi drivers for dwindling their income. Thousands of taxi drivers gathered in Jakarta to express their anger on Tuesday, a protest that escalated quickly and turned violent.  Once incident involved protesters attempting to rip off the jacket of an ojek or motorcycle driver, while another involved taxi drivers taking an ojek driver’s helmet and tossing it. Anger has been growing among taxi drivers worldwide at the challenge presented by Uber, one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, and a flurry of other app-based services that typically offer cheaper fares than traditional transport operators. Free ride A day after the protests, Blue Bird taxi company provided free service for 24 hours in an attempt to restore its image following violent protests involving some of its drivers. “The meter runs but I don’t have to pay,” Stuart Burney from Australia said in Jakarta after taking Blue Bird taxi on Wednesday, March 23. “Taking a free ride offered by the taxi company is pretty good.” Burney was one of the lucky ones since many people found it difficult to hail or order a Blue Bird cab on Wednesday. Netizens also complained about the supposed lack of taxis on Twitter, saying there was no point of it being free. Some Jakartans also expressed fear of taking a Blue Bird. “I am afraid to take Blue Bird taxis even if it offers us a free ride, after seeing drivers attack ojek riders on TV,” Daboe, a commuter in Jakarta, said to Rappler. New apps like Go-Jek have also allowed commuters to hail rides with motorcycles. She also worried that ojek riders might be vengeful towards taxis. Frightened Many drivers of ojek including Go-Jek and Grab, protected themselves from being attacked the day after the protests by taking off their uniform. Instead of their jackets that showed off their companies, they wore their own shirts instead.  “I don’t want to wear my Grab jacket today,” Igun, a rider working for Grab Taxi said. “The taxi drivers attacked my co-workers,” he added. Agus, another Grab rider, said that since Tuesday, he decided to not wear his uniform. Many of his friends who work for Grab Taxi made the same choice. “Maybe I will wear my uniform tomorrow,” he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/126903-kemenhub-operasi-grabcar-uber-taksi-ilegal/","title":"Kemenhub: Operasi Grab Car dan Uber Taksi ilegal","date":"Mar 23, 2016 6:31 PM PHT","snippet":"Kedua perusahan diminta memilih: Menjadi operator transportasi atau tetap sebagai aplikasi","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Kementerian Perhubungan memastikan pengoperasian Grab Car dan Uber Taksi ilegal karena tidak memenuhi ketentuan dalam Undang-Undang Nomor 22 Tahun 2009 Tentang Lalu Lintas Angkutan Jalan. “Dengan memperhatikan seluruh pasal-pasal Undang-Undang Nomor 22 Tahun 2009 Tentang Lalu Lintas Angkutan Jalan, sampai dengan hari ini operasi dari sisi aturan LLAJ adalah ilegal,” kata Pelaksana Tugas Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Darat Kementerian Perhubungan Sugihardjo dalam konferensi pers di Jakarta, Rabu, 23 Maret.  Sugihardjo mengatakan dalam undang-undang tersebut pengoperasian kedua aplikasi bertentangan karena termasuk kompetitor taksi. Untuk itu, Sugihardjo mengatakan pihaknya memberikan pilihan kepada kedua aplikasi tersebut untuk menjadi operator transportasi atau tetap sebagai aplikasi. Apabila menjadi operator transportasi, dia menuturkan, kedua aplikasi tersebut harus memiliki izin penyelenggaraan angkutan umum dari Dinas Perhubungan DKI Jakarta. “Misalnya menjadi perusahaan taksi, berarti harus ada argometer dan tanda khusus yang diberikan oleh kepolisian,” katanya. Selain itu, lanjut dia, pengemudi harus memiliki sim A atau sim B umum sesuai dengan jenis kendaraan yang dikemudikan. Sementara itu, Sugihardjo mengatakan, apabila Grab Car dan Uber Taksi ingin tetap menjadi perusahaan aplikasi, maka harus bekerja sama dengan perusahaan angkutan resmi yang sudah terdaftar atau koperasi. “Rental di DKI juga banyak dan mereka resmi, silakan kerja sama dengan yang punya izin dan kalau membentuk koperasi silakan juga,” katanya. Legal Manager Uber Indonesia Teddy Trianto mengatakan akan segera menenuhi ketentuan perizinan yang berlaku. “Kami mendorong mitra kami untuk mendapatkan seluruh perizinan sesuai dengan ketentuan pemerintah,” katanya. Sementara itu, Komisaris Uber Technology Indonesia Denny Sutadi juga akan melakukan hal yang sama. “Kami juga meminta pemerintah untuk memberi tahu, berkomunikasi apa-apa yang harus kami lakukan,” katanya.Ketua DPO Organisasi Pengusaha Angkutan Nasional Bermotor di Jalan (Organda) Adrianto Djokosoetono mengapresiasi upaya tersebut dan berjanji akan mencari solusi terbaik untuk semua. –dengan laporan Antara    BACA JUGA:              "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/126704-grab-jalin-kerjasama-lippo-group/","title":"Grab jalin kerjasama dengan Lippo Group","date":"Mar 22, 2016 10:25 AM PHT","snippet":"Lippo Group merupakan salah satu investor awal dari Grab","body":"  JAKARTA, Indonesia — Aplikasi booking transportasi asal Malaysia, Grab mengumumkan bahwa mereka telah melakukan kerja sama strategis dengan Lippo Group, pada Senin, 21 Maret.  Salah satu konglomerat di Indonesia ini dikenal sebagai pemilik sejumlah ritel, mal, dan rumah sakit ternama yang tersebar di kota-kota besar di Tanah Air. Melalui siaran pers, Lippo Group berencana akan memanfaatkan “keahlian transportasi dan pengiriman” milik Grab. Artinya Lippo akan memanfaatkan jaringan transportasi milik Grab untuk mendukung situs e-commerce miliknya, MatahariMall. Hubungan antara Grab dan Lippo Group ini bukanlah kali pertama yang dilakukan. Karena berdasarkan laporan, Lippo Group ternyata merupakan salah satu investor awal dari Grab. John Riady, selaku direktur dari Lippo Group, mengatakan bahwa Venturra Capital—modal ventura milik Lippo Group—memiliki sejumlah saham di Grab. Di Asia Tenggara, layanan GrabTaxi merupakan saingan berat dari aplikasi booking mobil asal Amerika Serikat, Uber. Sedangkan di Indonesia, GrabBike bersaing ketat dengan aplikasi booking khusus roda dua Go-Jek. Dalam siaran pers yang sama, pihak Grab juga mengungkapkan beberapa prestasi yang telah dan akan dicapai pada tahun ini. Pertama, Grab mengklaim bahwa layanan GrabTaxi mereka telah berhasil menguasai 50 persen pasar layanan booking transportasi roda empat di Indonesia. Hal itu mengindikasi bahwa Grab telah melebihi jumlah booking transportasi yang diperoleh Uber di Indonesia. Prestasi tersebut sudah berhasil mereka capai pada akhir 2015 lalu. Kedua, Grab mengklaim bahwa pada akhir bulan ini mereka akan memiliki 50 persen pasar layanan booking taksi roda dua di Indonesia.

Menteri Koperasi dan UKM, Anak Agung Gede Ngurah (AAGN) Puspayoga di kantor Kementerian Koperasi dan UKM di Jakarta menyerahkan akta pendirian badan hukum koperasi PRRI. “Dengan adanya badan hukum tersebut, saya mengharapkan polemik seputar angkutan darat beraplikasi teknologi bisa segera diakhiri,” kata Puspayoga pada Rabu, 16 Maret. Dia menyebut, pada dasarnya hal yang menjadi permasalahan saat ini bukan terletak kepada aplikasi online. Tetapi, pada badan hukumnya. Oleh sebab itu, perusahaan angkutan umum darat menganggap pihak lain tidak memenuhi aturan yang berlaku. “Nah, dengan badan hukum koperasi ini, para pengemudi pun sudah memiliki payung hukum. Mereka sudah bisa melakukan uji KIR (uji kendaraan) melalui koperasi,” kata dia. Selain itu, Puspayoga melanjutkan, dengan tergabung dalam badan koperasi, maka para anggotanya sudah bisa menikmati berbagai kemudahan dari pemerintah, antara lain fasilitas akses kredit usaha rakyat (KUR) dan Lembaga Pengelola Dana Bergulir (LPDB) KUMKM dengan suku bunga rendah. “Kredit itu bisa untuk uang muka mobil, misalnya. Kredit Rp25 juta tidak perlu memakai agunan yang bisa dinikmati oleh anggota koperasi,” tutur dia. Sementara, Ketua Koperasi Jasa PRRI, Ponco Seno menjelaskan, selama ini pengusaha rental mobil umumnya terafiliasi dengan aplikasi transportasi berbasis online seperti GrabCar dan Uber tidak memiliki badan hukum. “Dengan tergabung dalam badan koperasi, artinya kita sudah memiliki wadah secara resmi untuk menjalankan usaha sewa mobil, termasuk yang menggunakan aplikasi teknologi. Kita disatukan dalam satu wadah koperasi,” kata Ponco. Saat ini, jumlah anggota koperasi PRRI sudah mencapai 5.000 orang. Proses pengajuan badan hukum koperasi itu bahkan sudah berjalan sejak Oktober 2015. “Dasar kami berbadan hukum koperasi adalah memenuhi ketentuan UU Nomor 22 tahun 2009 tentang angkutan umum. Jadi, GrabCar sudah mengikuti aturan pemerintah untuk menjalankan bisnis transportasi di Indonesia,” kata dia. Manfaat lainnya yang diperoleh anggota koperasi yakni mereka mendapat fasilitas asuransi jiwa bagi pengemudi, ada pool bengkel bagi sekitar 300 unit dan bekerja sama dengan ATPM untuk perawatan kendaraan. Tidak ada izin Sebelumnya, Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan mengatakan mengukung keberadaan transportasi berbasis aplikasi online. Namun, dia mempermasalahkan baik GrabCar dan Uber tidak mengantongi izin. Izin yang disampaikan kepada Kementerian Perhubungan adalah keduanya masuk kategori perusahaan Teknologi Informasi (TI). “Itu saja, bukan (kami mempermasalahkan) soal onlinenya. Online sangat bagus, kami mendukung. Cuma hingga saat ini, baik Grab dan Uber mengaku mereka IT provider. Itu pun betul, kami tidak menyalahkan mereka,” ujar Jonan yang ditemui di Istana Negara pada Rabu, 16 Maret. Kendaraan yang digunakan oleh Uber dan GrabCar pun bukan dikategorikan untuk kendaraan umum baik itu taksi atau kendaraan sewa. Soal Uber dan GrabCar yang sudah tergabung dalam koperasi, dia turut mengaku belum menerima laporan itu. “Saya kok ga terima laporan itu ada izinnya. Kalau sudah masuk koperasi ya diajukan izinnya atas nama koperasi,” kata mantan Direktur PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) itu. Pihak GrabCar yang dihubungi Rappler mengatakan belum ingin berkomentar mengenai masuknya perusahaan mereka ke dalam koperasi. Sedangkan, pihak Uber tidak mengangkat telepon Rappler hari ini. Pada hari Senin kemarin, ribuan pengendara angkutan darat berunjuk rasa di dekat Istana Negara dan menuntut agar pemerintah menutup segera aplikasi online yang digunakan oleh GrabCar dan Uber. Para demonstran yang didominasi oleh sopir taksi itu mengeluh sejak kehadiran transportasi berbasis aplikasi online, penghasilan mereka menurun drastis. Para sopir taksi menuding transportasi berbasis aplikasi online bisa memberlakukan tarif murah karena tidak membayar pajak dan memiliki izin operasional di Indonesia. – dengan laporan ANTARA/Rappler.com BACA JUGA:"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/125855-pangilinan-abs-cbn-pulse-asia-march-2016/","title":"Kiko Pangilinan grabs solo lead from Sotto in survey","date":"Mar 15, 2016 10:58 AM PHT","snippet":"Erstwhile senatorial survey front runner Senator Vicente Sotto III slides to 2nd place","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Former senator Francis Pangilinan grabbed the solo lead in the latest ABS-CBN survey on senatorial choices conducted by Pulse Asia from March 1-6, according to data released on Tuesday, March 15.

Diego Palomares, a former judge and assemblyman, led the group with orders from Tanay Mayor Rafael Tanjuatco, according to the Georeserve’s statement. The group successfully occupied the area despite protest from the Georeserve. During this time, the latter said the police did nothing.  On the night of March 9, police officers, led by Chief Inspector Bartolome Marigondon, allegedly entered the conservation area to take away the evidence.  Marigondon, however, told Rappler he was not involved in any operations in the area, and police were in the area as part of their regular patrols.  He also denied claims that officers were part of the land grabbing operations, saying they would only step in if it became a matter of peace and order, or if they were ordered to intervene. Fences ‘a clear safety risk’  The Tanay Municipal Government denied these claims and accused the Georeserve and its developer, Blue Star Development and Construction (BSDC), of placing the fence dangerously close to the Marikina-Infanta Highway, a national road.  In their own statement countering the Georeserve’s accusations, the local government said BSDC received letters from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Rizal II District Engineering Office District Engineer Adilbert Rosete about the fencing.  “Why was BSDC so adamant to voluntarily take down a clear safety risk even after two notices of obstruction and prohibited uses (January 29, 2016 and February 11, 2016) sent to it by DPWH Rizal II?” it  asked. “The claim that the fencing is against public interest, particularly farmers, is absolutely illogical and completely unfounded,” said the Georeserve. “It is also not our fences which have barbed wires on them that may be harmful to motorists, and is closest to the road in the said area…Ours are cleanly made and have been sturdy enough to prevent several motorists from falling into nearby cliffs.” Permit concerns  The statement from the Georeserve said it will move to the municipality of Baras, in Rizal, where it said its “conservation works are appreciated” and where “all permits have been appropriately dealt with and renewed.” This move and the Georeserve’s statement saying Tanay’s government does not have jurisdiction over its activities “are totally without basis as the land title of the lot identifies Tanay as its location.” It added that BSDC had been securing its permit from the Tanay government for 15 years.  For now, however, it said conservation activities, visits, and maintenance will “proceed as usual” while the Georeserve and the Tanay municipal government look for a resolution in court. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/profiles-and-advocacies/124718-conversation-grabbike-public-transport/","title":"#CommuterWatch: Should the Government bring back GrabBike?","date":"Mar 5, 2016 3:01 PM PHT","snippet":"The LTFRB recently suspended the app-based motorcycle service for safety reasons.

With the current congested and crippled state of mass transportation in the city, there are only so many options for the busy Manila commuter.  Late last year, ride-booking service Grab launched the latest iteration of their service: GrabBike. Aside from booking a taxi, car, or even a helicopter, the app’s users can now also book a motorcycle to get around Metro Manila. (READ: Road-testing the GrabBike)  Since its launch in the Philippines in 2013, the Grab app has had 12 million downloads, making GrabBike accessible to virtually anyone with a smartphone. Last Feb 4, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) issued a Cease and Desist Order for the service.  The LTFRB decision was founded on concern for passenger safety. But until the LTFRB releases revised regulations for motorcycles, only 4-wheeled vehicles will be allowed to offer public transport. Meanwhile, other 2-wheeled unofficial public transportation systems like habal-habals remain unapprehended. While the Cease and Desist Order is in place, around 800 registered GrabBike riders will be jobless and without income. Meanwhile, options for public transportation within Metro Manila remain few and far between. What’s your take on this issue? Are you or aren’t you happy with the transport options currently available? Do you think the Government should bring back GrabBike? Tell us. On Tuesday, March 8, we will be holding a Twitter conversation with the hashtag #CommuterWatch based on the issue of alternative public transport options for the daily commuter.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said in a statement on Friday, March 4, that it supports the Department of Transportation and Communications’ (DOTC) position prohibiting the use of motorcycles or bikes as a mode for public transport. In a letter reply to Grab Philippines by the DOTC dated February 26, it said that motorcycles and bikes are not considered as public transport due to safety reasons.  “It is not also line with the Department’s policy of shifting to higher capacity public transport system especially in dense urban areas,” DOTC’s reply read. DOTC said in the letter that although Grab Philippines presented the safety and security features they are adopting in relation to their request, bike riders are still the most vulnerable road users on national streets. Fatality rate LTFRB cited a Metropolitan Manila Development Authority’s (MMDA) Metro Manila Accident Recording and Analysis System database, stating that motorcycles have the highest fatality accident rate in Metro Manila from January to November 2015.  Out of the 696 road fatalities recorded in that period, 236 were due to motorcycle accidents, LTFRB said.  It was just in November 2015 when Grab decided to pilot its motorcycle service called GrabBike in Makati City and Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. Just two months after, GrabBike faced resistance from the government. (WATCH: Road-testing the GrabBike) Last January 27, LTFRB ordered GrabBike to cease operations until the regulator has promulgated guidelines to authorize the service. “Our main objective is to provide the commuters safe, reliable and convenient transport system; recognizing motorcycles as ‘for hire service’ or a form of public transport doesn’t fit into the policy framework of the Department,” LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez said. LTFRB said the agency and DOTC have been introducing ways to solve congestion by reducing vehicles on the road.  One solution LTFRB said it has been doing is the launching of premier point-to-point bus services that can be availed by all commuters. “The Board remains firm in exercising our authority to regulate land-based public transportation, we will not tolerate transport operators to provide transport service using motorcycles or bikes until we have set the proper guidelines and regulations,” Ginez said. To date, there is no department order that covers the operation of a motorcycle or bike services through the use of an Internet-based technology platform to facilitate a pre-arranged transportation for passengers. On Wednesday, March 2, GrabBike driver Mon Carlo Gaya was apprehended by LTFRB when he accepted a booking reserved by the LTFRB chairman. Ginez said this confirms that despite a cease order, GrabBike continues to provide the bike service. The LTFRB has impounded the motorcycle of Gaya, while he faces a fine amounting to P6,000. — Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/124365-ltfrb-arrest-grab-bike/","title":"LTFRB to arrest GrabBike drivers","date":"Mar 2, 2016 2:13 PM PHT","snippet":"During a hearing, the LTFRB chief books a GrabBike ride to prove that the service is still ongoing despite a cease and desist order","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will start apprehending GrabBike drivers after the motorcycle-hailing service was found to have continued operations despite a cease and desist order. LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez said the board would start clamping down on these drivers because they are considered to be illegally operating under the public service law. The LTFRB on Wednesday, March 2, summoned MyTaxi.PH – the transportation network company offering GrabTaxi and GrabCar – to explain why its accreditation should not be cancelled after it continued offering the GrabBike service on its app-based platform. The legal counsels of MyTaxi.PH, however, said that they could not answer questions on the operations of GrabBike because it is being operated by a different company. In its show cause order dated February 23, the LTFRB said that Grab once again offered its motorcycle-hailing service even after it announced in early February that it would be temporarily suspending operations. This was in compliance with an LTFRB order issued on January 27, ordering the suspension of GrabBike operations because it was not part of the business model approved and accredited by the board. Illegal operations During the Wednesday hearing, Ginez used his phone to book a GrabBike ride to prove that the service was still ongoing. On the Grab app, the GrabBike service is offered for free. To get a free ride, passengers need to key in a promo code. The driver, identified as Mon Carlo Gaya, was apprehended by LTFRB officials and questioned by Ginez. Gaya said that Grab informed its drivers about the suspension of operations, but was later told it would be resumed with passengers riding for free. GrabBike drivers, meanwhile, would be paid P40 for each trip. Ginez informed Gaya that he was operating illegally. The driver was issued an inspection report summons, requiring him to explain before the board why a fine of P6,000 should not be imposed on him. His motorcycle will also be impounded. While the GrabBike service was being offered to passengers for free, Ginez said that its operations are covered by the public service law. “It’s still covered by the public service law because you are transporting a passenger with compensation…. Compensation under the public service law is treated as any economic benefit to the entity which provides the service,” Ginez said. He said that the company is still benefiting by increasing patronage of the service. Different entities Meanwhile, the lawyers of MyTaxi.PH maintained that it could not explain GrabBike’s operations because it falls under a different company. In a February 3 hearing of the House committee on transportation, Grab said that the motorcycle-hailing service was operated by Grab Bike Incorporated. But it still uses the same app where other Grab services like GrabTaxi and GrabCar can be booked. The LTFRB’s cease and desist letter, as well as its show cause order, was addressed to MyTaxi.PH. “We’re not representing GrabBike Inc…. We were directed to show cause and yet we were obliged to answer for GrabBike, which is not connected to MyTaxi.Ph,” legal counsel Jerome Leynes said. Leynes pointed out that operations of GrabTaxi and GrabCar will stand to suffer if their accreditation is cancelled due to the actions of an entirely different entity. But Ginez dismissed this, saying it was merely “their allegation” that the two companies are not connected. “But it shows otherwise because they use the same system. And what we accredited was the model, the system itself,” he added. The LTFRB decided to amend its show cause order and its cease and desist order to also cover Grab Bike Incorporated. It also expanded the coverage of the orders to include stopping the operations of the recently-introduced free service, Grab Jeep. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/121409-grab-temporarily-suspends-grabbike-operations/","title":"Grab temporarily halts GrabBike operations","date":"Feb 5, 2016 10:03 AM PHT","snippet":"","body":" Grab Philippines on Thursday, February 4, stopped the operations of its motorbike service called GrabBike, heeding an earlier order from the land transport regulator. “GrabBike will temporarily be stopping operations effective today, February 4, 2016,” the ride-hailing app company said in a statement.

But the motorcycle ride-hailing service is being operated by a separate company – Grab Bike Incorporated – even though it also uses the same app-based platform.  “We are still operating GrabBike as we speak. The cease and desist letter was sent to the wrong entity….Once the GrabBike entity receives the cease and desist, we will honor that,” Teng said. Last week, the LTFRB ordered the suspension of the GrabBike service, saying MyTaxi.PH has not been accredited to offer the use of motorcycles or bikes as part of its business model. (READ: Could this be GrabBike’s last ride in the Philippines?) “We will have no option but to cancel MYTAXI.PH’s accreditation if they continue to offer motorcycle transport service which is not part of its business model and not what the Board had envisioned for TNCs and TNVS,” LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez said in a statement. During the House hearing, Teng said the GrabBike service aims to address a strong demand from commuters for a faster and more efficient form of transport, given Metro Manila’s hours-long traffic jams. She said that most GrabBike passengers take the service when they are in a hurry, or if they only need to travel shorter distances, such as transferring from the train station to a bus stop. Teng also said that around 2.6 million motorcycle drivers stand to gain from the employment opportunities provided by the company. But committee chairman Catanduanes Representative Cesar Sarmiento said that with the absence of approval from the LTFRB, GrabBike should cease operations because it is still operating illegally as a public utility vehicle. “If you are transporting passengers from one point to another, then you are a public utility vehicle. And if you are a public utility vehicle, you must secure an authority coming from the LTFRB. In the absence of an authority from the LTFRB, you are a ‘colorum’ [vehicle],” Sarmiento said. While Teng said the company would comply once it receives the cease and desist letter, she also said Grab would like to work with transport authorities to craft regulations specifically for the motorcycle service, similar to what it did  when the transportation department laid out rules for new transport categories covering the ride-hailing services. “We also want to offer a solution to the government….If you take the case of GrabCar, it wasn’t regulated at first. Now it is. When it first began, it really was a service for the people, just like GrabBike,” Teng said. She added that the GrabBike service, which operates much like the local habal-habal, aims to create a safer, more regulated form of motorcycle-based public transport. “If you’re going to have habal-habal in Metro Manila anyway, and it’s unsafe and operating illegally, and there’s a solution to make it safer and to regulate it with the government, we’re very open to explore that option,” Teng said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/120713-grabtaxi-rebrand-grab/","title":"GrabTaxi ubah nama jadi Grab, apa yang baru?","date":"Jan 29, 2016 3:15 PM PHT","snippet":"GrabTaxi 'rebranding' jadi Grab, perbarui aplikasi dan luncurkan 'dashboard' buat pengguna","body":" Aplikasi untuk memesan taksi, GrabTaxi, mengumumkan bahwa mereka telah mengubah brand menjadi Grab, pada Kamis, 28 Januari.

The LTFRB directed the company to explain why the company is offering a service that has not been given a go-signal by the government. Will this be GrabBike’s last ride? Chrisee dela Paz reports. – Rappler.com  With commuters getting tired of Metro Manila’s traffic jam, more and more people are using GrabTaxi’s new motorcycle service called GrabBike.  Since November last year, GrabBike has been on beta testing, servicing Makati City and Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. I’ve tried out GrabBike to find out the pros and cons of riding one. I book a ride in Tordesillas Street in Makati City going to Bonifacio Global City. In less than 5 minutes, I was able to get GrabBike driver Noel Barredo to accept my request. As a rule, Grab Bike drivers offer the passenger a disposable face mask and shower cap before wearing helmet The base fare for off-peak hours is 40 for the first 2 kilometers, with an additional P10 per kilometer for the first 2 to 7 kilometers. GrabBike was first offered in Jakarta, Indonesia in May 2015. Following its huge success in Jakarta, Grab Bike is now pilot testing in Metro Manila where there are now hundreds of  units. GrabBike provides a new source of income to Filipinos like Noel, who used to work for a shipping company. NOEL BARREDO, GRABBIKE OPERATOR/DRIVER: The demand for GrabBike is high and the income is just right for our needs. It’s actually better than the minimum. I just resigned from my previous job and this is now my full time work.   Despite the heat, Noel says he logs around 12 hours a day, transporting an average of 10 passengers.  NOEL BARREDO, GRABBIKE OPERATOR/DRIVER: Yesterday I booked my highest number of trips so far. I had 10 rides. I earned around P800, which is the highest so far. Although the ability to zigzag through traffic jams is their edge over four-wheeled vehicles, passenger safety remains Grab Bike’s priority. Noel asked several times during the ride if he was going too fast, or if I am fine with his driving. After all, they still have to abide by traffic rules. And unlike riding a car, there’s no airconditioning while you’re on a Grab Bike. Expect to be sweaty because of the heat. In less than 15 minutes, we get to my destination in BGC, to the tune of 80 pesos. The ride is fast, cheap, but a bit sweaty.

In a regional launch in Singapore on Thursday, January 28, GrabTaxi rebranded itself as Grab to reflect its new range of services. Its new company name says that it no longer only offers pre-arranged taxi rides – the service it started out in 2012. (READ: GrabTaxi PH launches GrabPay, GrabHeli) The new Grab encompasses all its services: taxis (GrabTaxi), private car services (GrabCar), motorcycles (GrabBike), social carpooling (GrabHitch), and last mile delivery (GrabExpress), under one umbrella brand.  “We’ve grown over the years – and we’re now much more than a taxi app. This new brand is an important evolution that represents our goal to outserve our customers,” Grab Group CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan said during the regional launch. Dominance in Southeast Asia Since its establishment in 2012, Grab has evolved from a taxi-booking application to Southeast Asia’s largest land transport company.  Grab now has over 200,000 drivers and more than 11 million mobile downloads. (READ: Could this be GrabBike’s last ride in the Philippines?) The company’s data show that in mid-2015, it experienced 35% average monthly growth in GrabCar rides and a 75% average monthly growth in GrabBike rides across the region. These figures are encouraging as Grab aims to move far ahead of other ride-hailing companies like Uber. (READ: Uber plans APEC region expansion despite rough ride) “We have set the benchmark in the industry, with the most number of transport services that cater to all price points, all available in one app,” Tan said. Grab’s CEO said his company will “grow from the current 28 cities across 6 Southeast Asian countries,” but did not specify where.  “What I can say is we are focusing all our energy in providing better transport services in the region,” Tan said. Grab’s regional focus allows the company to navigate the Southeast Asian terrain smoothly, helping the firm to win over traditional taxi companies. Tan said when it comes to profit, “Grab will sustain the growth in 2016 and continue shooting for the sky.” Beefed up services With its new branding, Grab has also beefed up its smartphone app with more user-friendly features, including personalized pickup and dropoff locations, GrabPay mobile wallet, and GrabWork. GrabPay allows passengers to go cashless, either via credit or debit cards.  GrabWork, meanwhile, is aimed at business professionals who can now tag their rides and track receipts easily for expense claims purposes. According to Tan, their company is also investing in engineering centers, with one each in the United States, Beijing, China, and Singapore.   On a ‘friendlier’ road To help win the Southeast Asian market, Grab VP for Marketing Cheryl Goh said her company is taking a friendlier road than its rivals. While some of Grab’s rivals have developed a reputation for being combative, Goh said they are leaning towards a “more open and collaborative working environment” with regulators. In the Philippines, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday ordered Grab to cease operations of GrabBike until proper guidelines are promulgated. “We’re not going to fight the government. We will, instead, discuss with them how to go about it. I think all of us have the same end-goal: Provide better transport for the commuters. It’s not all about profit,” Goh said. While Uber hurdles legal battles in Germany and the United States, among others, GrabTaxi has avoided disputes with transport regulators to “provide as many public transportation options to commuters as possible,” Goh added. According to Goh, Grab’s end-goal is to influence people to make ride-hailing a daily habit. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/119018-gojek-grab-taxi-tumpangan-gratis-evakuasi-bom-sarinah/","title":"Go-Jek dan GrabTaxi berikan tumpangan gratis di Jakarta untuk bantu evakuasi dampak bom Sarinah","date":"Jan 14, 2016 3:02 PM PHT","snippet":"Evakuasi gratis dari Grab berlaku di seluruh area Jakarta dan Tangerang Selatan.

Urbandub also gave a final show this year – on May 9, they held their last concert before going on hiatus. Vocalist Gabby Alipe told Rappler that the band just needed some time to rest and be with their families.

Aside from Urbandub’s high-energy performances, we witnessed a lot of great concerts this year too. Below, concert photographer Stephen Lavoie, Rappler contributor Paolo Abad, and Rappler Multimedia Producer Marga Deona discuss their favorites.  Marga Deona, Rappler Multimedia Producer Kamikazee Shortly after Urbandub announced a hiatus, local rock band Kamikazee followed suit. Best known for a string of hits such as ‘Narda’ and their their tongue-in-cheek humor, the band said it will be taking a break after 2015.    Its final concert Huling Sayaw in the Smart-Araneta Coliseum was packed from the moshpit to the bleachers with fans from the past 15 years.

With so many top-notch artists now visiting our shores, it’s difficult to choose. Of course, you’d think the best picks would be some of the big names, like One Direction, Maroon 5 or Katy Perry.     But I find those huge production shows often rather impersonal. The nature of the beast, I suppose, when it comes to massive gatherings – it’s easy to get lost in the shuffle. What makes a concert stand out for me isn’t the size of the production or the on-stage pomp and circumstance. Sure you get some spectacular lighting and sound system at many of these events but that’s not really what it’s all about. Yes, all the technical mumbo jumbo is important, especially audio but it doesn’t have to be perfect to make it memorable. The Charlie Puth mall event was a technical disaster. The sound system crashed twice and wasn’t working properly for most of the show. Ironically, this forced the performer to address the crowd for a longer time compared to normal, which made the event interesting. It was something akin to a radio appearance, or a press conference, where they would chat for a while then play some songs.  The show doesn’t have to be perfect to be outstanding. It’s nice to see a mistake every once and a while, reminding us that these gifted artists are people, too. Incubus There were plenty of up and coming artists that could have easily made the top 5, Carly Rae Jepsen, Ariana Grande, Ed Sheeran, Against the Current, Charli XCX or Pentatonix, to name a few. I’d have to go with Incubus as the number one on my list. They’ve performed here before but still drew a large crowd, close to selling out the Big Dome. It’s relatively small as far as arenas go, but still can provide that intimate feeling, as long as the performer knows what they’re doing – and Brandon Boyd does.  Lighting was solid. Sound system was dialled in. The crowd was attentive and the band just really got into it. Incubus is one of those rare bands that may sound better performing live than in the studio. At times, you felt you could be listening to a recording, then they’d mix it up with gusto, and variations to what you’d hear on album version, masterfully done, really exceptional.  Everything just went right; it was in the cards. Either that or it’s a highly skilled group of musicians with many years of experience, basically putting on a clinic on how to have a successful concert. Save Me Hollywood  Save Me Hollywood is one of my favorite local acts, with Julz Savard on lead vocals. They were opening for Cody Simpson, and although the crowd was still trickling in during their performance, the band wasn’t distracted and performed well together. Lighting was nice and they sounded fantastic, but what impressed me the most was their energy on-stage and the crowd responded. Pepe Smith  Pepe Smith performing at Exodus Music and Arts Festival was another favorite. I know he’s a local legend but I had never photographed him before. It was obvious by the way he commanded the stage, you were watching a pro. Also, the gray hair was a giveaway. It was his stage presence that caught my eye. Also, the audience perked right up when he took the stage, and he rocked it. You can see why he’s so popular. He really got the crowd into it, well done. Lifehouse  Another memorable one was Lifehouse. Everything was technically well done and all the production elements were in place, but what caught my attention here was an emotional connection between the performer and the crowd. It’s one of those things that’s hard to explain with words but you could really feel it. It was almost palpable. It’s what live music is all about, those “moments” where artists and fans are connected. Bryan White  Bryan White is another on my list. Yes, believe it or not, country music in the Philippines. Although this genre may not be abundantly popular here, the AlDub portion of the Eat Bulaga TV show is, which features his song “God Gave Me You”. The only other country artists I can think of who have visited these shores is Kenny Rogers, the namesake of the fast-food chain that held a show to inaugurate the restaurants’ grand openings. Another was Taylor Swift, who started as a country star and is now a crossover artist.  I was privileged with special access for this one and was not only super impressed with Bryan’s performance but also with how he handled himself off-stage. He showed true appreciation of his fans and a humility that is refreshing to see in this industry. At one point on-stage, there certainly was a “moment” and Bryan even got a bit choked up – touching stuff. Cody Simpson Unexpectedly, Cody Simpson is in my top 5. I’m far from being a bubble gum teen-idol fan and was certainly not thrilled when I discovered I’d be covering this one. Yes, his career began as more of a commercialized product, common in today’s music marketplace. It’s almost as if a group of young listeners are force-fed specific brands and have seemingly been brainwashed to love what is basically the fast food equivalent of music. But Cody has recently left his record label and struck out on his own path as an independent artist, and he’s not what I expected him to be, more rock and roll than pop. I was way off the mark and pleasantly surprised. And the band came out firing on all cylinders. He grabbed the audience’s attention from square one, and took them on a ride, from fits of screaming, to an eerily uncommon hush among the crowd. At one point in the show, they performed a medley, which featured one of my favored blues songs, “Sweet Home Chicago,” and the blues is something you just can’t fake. He knocked it out of the park – well done! Mutemath  Lastly, I’d have to go with Mutemath. An outdoor concert with thousands in attendance, getting lucky with perfect weather. But it was the phenomenal on-stage energy that stood out. I loved this show, an amazing live representation of their music with top-notch design and planning, a phenomenal visual experience. And how could you not enjoy a high-energy performance with a lead vocalist even doing headstands on his keyboard or crowd surfing on an LED-lit air mattress?   And you know you’re in for a wild ride, when the drummer’s pre-show routine involves securing his headset to his bald head using duct tape.  Some honorable mentions for me were a few bands that I hold in high regard: Crosby, Stills and Nash, The Zombies, and Spandau Ballet. Concerts that you have to experience to really take it all in. The stack appears to be towering in our favor. I can’t wait to see what 2016 brings. There’s already numerous festivals that I’m psyched about, featuring names like Death Cab for Cutie, Kayne West, Chvrches, and Passion Pit. Paolo Abad, Rappler contributor The Script  These Irishmen, led by Danny O’Donoghue, knew exactly how to put on a thrilla in Manila. They had a B-stage jutting out way in the middle of the audience, and Danny even walked among the bleachers of the lower boxes during one part of the band’s set. (READ: 5 unforgettable moments from The Script Manila concert 2015) Hale  Wanderland 2015 was almost made to be a trip down memory lane, with our younger selves’ favorites, Augustana and Hale on the lineup. After Hale’s 5-year hiatus, there we were, singing “Blue Sky” and “Broken Sonnet” again at a music festival, and it was a magical thing to behold. alt-J  The Leeds 3-piece weren’t exactly the most charismatic showmen, but their genre-defying music – not quite folk, not quite trip-hop – was sublime live. alt-J was indeed a great fit for the Theatre at Solaire’s state-of-the-art acoustics. They sounded so pristine, and everyone in the intimate setting was transfixed. (IN PHOTOS: alt-J live in Manila) By the end of the night, the crowd clamored with the “Please don’t go / I’ll eat you whole / I love you so” part of “Breezeblocks.” Skrillex (at Road to Ultra Manila)  Music producer and dubstep stalwart Skrillex was practically the main draw at the local edition of Road to Ultra, the global party series and EDM festival. He dropped bass-filled banger after banger, even closing his set with his irresistible collaboration (along with Diplo) with the Biebs, “Where Are Ü Now.” Backstreet Boys  “I wanna ask you if you want to take a trip down memory lane with us tonight and party like it’s 1999!” said Kevin at their sold-out 2015 Manila show. Just like that, I was a wee grade-schooler again. It’s been more than two decades since the singular boy band sensation started, but AJ, Brian, Howie Kevin, and Nick could still rock their body. Time and again, it could still be said, “Backstreet’s back.” Ariana Grande  A formidable vocal powerhouse, Ariana Grande seems to effortlessly belt out the most challenging songs. When she reprised her cover of Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing” for the Manila crowd, that was quite a showstopper. (IN PHOTOS: Ariana Grande ‘The Honeymoon Tour’ Live in Manila) Sam Smith  Sam Smith’s show almost didn’t happen. But he delivered a feels fest, and definitely made up for postponing his show to November. (IN PHOTOS: Sam Smith in sold-out Manila concert, thanks fans for ‘magical’ first trip) “These aren’t my songs anymore. They are your songs,” said the British singer to the audience.  Maroon 5  It was the Adam Levine-led pop rock band’s third time in the country, and just like their previous visits, they rocked everyone’s socks off. Adam, ever the charismatic frontman, made legions of fans swoon at his creamy vocals. (IN PHOTOS: Maroon 5 thrills Manila fans) Tycho  Tycho’s gig was, suffice it to say, visually arresting. As designer and photographer Scott Hansen’s ambient rock project, Tycho didn’t only conjure an expansive soundscape, but created mesmerizing backdrop projections, too. Justice   These giants of French electronic music – up there in the pantheon with Daft Punk – were responsible for infamously riotous arena shows like A Cross the Universe and Access All Arenas. The duo graced the Valkyrie Nightclub at the Palace for a DJ set, albeit with little fanfare. Like true legends, they had everyone dancing the night away and even chanting in unison the chorus of “We Are Your Friends.” Which were your favorite concerts in 2015? Did they make it to the list?

The award, presented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and partner states and civil society organizations, put the spotlight on outstanding local and indigenous community efforts to address poverty, protect the environment, and build resilience in the face of global warming.  “They are thinking globally by acting locally…Their efforts are inspiring. Local and indigenous communities play such an indispensable role in protecting ecosystems which sustain life on our planet,” according to UNDP administrator Helen Clark.  About two-thirds of the world’s estimated 400 million indigenous peoples live in Asia, according to the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA). Indigenous wisdom In the course of the day, partners of the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact (AIPP) will highlight their issues and contributions to combat climate change. At 11 am (Paris time), a panel discussion will tackle good indigenous practices and urgent climate change issues from the region. "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/113367-chua-centeno-prevail-asian-pool-tournaments/","title":"Filipinos Chua, Centeno win big in Asian pool tournaments","date":"Nov 19, 2015 1:36 PM PHT","snippet":"Johann Chua becomes the second straight Filipino to win the All-Japan Championship while 16-year-old Chezka Centeno becomes the youngest Filipino world champion","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Filipino pool stars Johann Chua and Chezka Centeno came away victorious in major pool tournaments held in Asia this week. Chua finished first overall out of 128 international and local players in the 10-ball, race to 11 48th All-Japan Championship which was held from November 9-15 in Amagasaki, Japan. After going through the first two rounds undefeated, Chua pulled out an impressive win against 4-time US Open Champion and 2015 9-ball finalist Shane Van Boening in the semifinals. It was the first time both pool players met head to head. Chua raced off to a quick lead against Van Boening, going ahead 5-0 thanks to his aggressive and consistent pocketing ability. Chua also did a good job giving Van Boening difficult looks as he managed to properly hide the cue ball to give his opponent tough shooting angles. Van Boening was able to retaliate after his slow start, but it wasn’t enough to save him from defeat as Chua used his early lead to cruise to an 11-6 upset. In the finals, Chua faced a Filipino opponent in Ronato Alcano, who came out of the gates on fire by establishing a 5-0 lead early. Chua grabbed momentum in the sixth rack once given the chance to shoot. That was enough to build momentum for him to tie the game at 7-7. Alcano didn’t get the opportunity to take control the rest of the way, as Chua’s consistency let him take the lead and cruise to the title. It was a sweet victory for Chua, who lost in the semifinals of the tournament consecutively from 2012-2013. It became the second straight year a Filipino won the tournament as Chua followed the footsteps of Raymund Faraon. Centeno, on the other hand, capped off an impressive 2015 campaign by winning the 2015 World Junior 9-ball Championship in Shanghai, China. After defeating Wang Xiaoting in the quarterfinals and Teng Jiang in the semis, Centeno took down Xia Yuying of China, 9-3, in the finals.  It was another major victory for the Zamboanga native, who won gold in the 28th Southeast Asian games held in Singapore by defeating co-Filipina Rubilen Amit in the women’s 9-ball singles finals. The 16-year-old Centeno is the youngest female champion of pool from the Philippines. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/112631-george-clooney-social-bite-homeless/","title":"George Clooney grabs a bite at shop helping homeless","date":"Nov 13, 2015 10:31 AM PHT","snippet":"","body":"  Movie actor George Clooney dropped by the Social Bite café in Edinburgh Thursday, November 12.

Jokowi meets Obama US President Barack Obama on Monday, October 26 welcomed to the White House political upstart Joko “Jokowi” Widodo – the first Indonesian president to visit in a decade and a leader his hosts hope can help catalyze the world’s most populous Muslim nation. During their meeting, Obama won Indonesia’s endorsement for a contentious trans-Pacific trade deal Monday, with the president of Southeast Asia’s largest economy vowing to join. “Indonesia is an open economy and with a population of 250 million, we are the largest economy in Southeast Asia,” Widodo said in the Oval Office. “Indonesia intends to join the TPP.”  But Widodo also announced the cancelation of his trip to San Francisco to attend to the worsening haze in his home country. The Palace confirmed that Jokowi is cutting his trip short due to the complaints from the public on the impact of the haze on their health. Read more. 2. Deadly quake  A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake which rocked parts of South Asia killed more than 160 people Monday, including 12 Afghan girls crushed in a stampede as they fled their collapsing school. At least 1,000 more were injured and hundreds of homes destroyed as the quake shook a swathe of the subcontinent, sending thousands of frightened people rushing into the streets in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. It was centered near Jurm in northeast Afghanistan, 250 kilometers (160 miles) from the capital Kabul and at a depth of 213.5 kilometers, the US Geological Survey said.

Warships arrive  Indonesia has deployed 3 warships, with more on standby, to deliver face masks, tents and medical supplies to thousands of people affected by acrid haze from forest fires, an official said Monday, October 26. For nearly two months, thousands of fires caused by slash-and-burn farming in Indonesia have choked vast expanses of Southeast Asia, forcing schools to close and scores of flights and some international events to be canceled.

Volatile market  Asian traders on Monday, October 26 welcomed China’s decision to cut borrowing costs again and remove a cap on savings rates ahead of this week’s policy meeting, but analysts warned the move indicates further weakness in the world’s number two economy. While Friday’s move – the 6th reduction since November – realized hopes for further monetary easing, Premier Li Keqiang tempered the joy by indicating China’s economy could grow less than 7% this year. Emerging market currencies also retreated as the latest announcement led to concerns about the Chinese outlook, a week after official data showed the economy expanded in the 3rd quarter at its slowest pace in 6 years. Read more. 5.

Pedrosa rocketed his Honda bike around the 3.4 mile Sepang circuit in a fastest ever lap time of one minute 59.053 seconds in Saturday qualifying, 0.409 seconds ahead of Marquez. In third place was veteran rider and championship leader Valentino Rossi, who will start in the front row ahead of his Yamaha team-mate and old rival, Spaniard Jorge Lorenzo. Lorenzo finished fourth, 0.684 seconds behind Pedrosa. (READ: Lorenzo puts heat on Rossi in Malaysian MotoGP practice) Crowd favorite Rossi, who put on a stellar ride to the delight of his supporters, was 0.673 seconds behind Pedrosa. “To start in the front row will help me in the tough race. Anything can happen,” the Italian told reporters with a smile. Bitter championship battle  Lorenzo, 28, had dominated Friday’s practice, but qualified in fourth and will start in the second row along with Honda’s Cal Crutchlow and Ducati’s Andrea Iannone.  It will be a nail-biting world championship battle: only Rossi and Lorenzo can win this year’s MotoGP crown in the final two rounds of the season. Two-time world champion Lorenzo came in second at Philip Island last week and has narrowed the gap with Rossi to just 11 points. Despite crashing during the fourth free practice, Lorenzo looked resolute in attempting to catch up by securing front row in Sepang, but the Italian – cheered on by his die-hard fans – denied Lorenzo a prime place in the grid.  Rossi is hoping for a 10th career world title, but has yet to win since in 2009. On Friday, Lorenzo rubbished Rossi’s allegation that 22-year-old rival Marquez had helped Lorenzo win the Philip Island race, following a similar denial from Marquez himself. Lorenzo and Rossi were team-mates at Yamaha between 2006-2008, but relations was tense. Things improved after Rossi rejoined Yamaha in 2013, but with the world title at stake their old animosity has re-emerged. For Rossi to win the title on Sunday, he would need to push his advantage up to 26 points. Rossi, the oldest rider in the MotoGP entry list, risks a world title showdown in the season’s final race in Valencia on November 8 if he does not grab the title in Malaysia. Sepang is one of the season’s most demanding circuits but is also Rossi’s favorite track as the Yamaha racer has won 6 times here in the premier class. Temperatures can soar well above 40 degrees Celsius at the circuit, which lies outside Kuala Lumpur and is one of the longest in the season. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/107653-ph-asia-shopping-destination/","title":"PH is Asia’s next shopping destination?","date":"Sep 30, 2015 9:00 PM PHT","snippet":"The Philippine Retailers Association is reviving efforts to groom the country as a tourism shopping hub in the region like Hong Kong and Singapore","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Major retailers are grooming anew the Philippines as the next shopping destination in Asia. Philippine Retailers Association (PRA) president Lorenzo Formoso said the group is reviving efforts initiated 15 years ago to groom the country for tourism shopping and grab a slice of the booming business from shopping destinations Hong Kong and Singapore. The efforts are based on what Formoso called the “sweet spot” in consumer spending from 2015 to 2017, which ushered in the “bright days for retail.” “We want to put the Philippines in the shopping map. We have to raise awareness of the offerings that we have. We have to catch up. We have to have a slice of travel retailing,” Formoso said on the sidelines of the Philippine Shopping Festival 2015 launch on September 29. PRA Vice Chairman Roberto Claudio said the Philippine retail industry is growing 5% to 8% per year but did not provide statistics. Citing data from the Department of Trade and Industry, PRA said retail contributes 13% to gross domestic product (GDP). Formoso said this would rise to 15% over the short­-term. Retail boom Claudio said retail greatly benefits from rising foreign visitor arrivals into the country. The Department of Tourism earlier estimated that every foreign tourist spends an average of $300 per visit to the country. Formosa said while the DOT did not meet its 5 ­million arrival target in 2014, tourism spending rose and the number of stays doubled from an average of 3 days to 6.More foreign brands are also coming in the Philippines but that local brands continue to fight it out despite the competition, PRA noted. PRA, in cooperation with DOT is staging the Philippine Shopping Festival 2015 from October 23 to November 8. Joining the 2-week shopping festival are Araneta Center Incorporated, Ayala Malls, Duty Free Philippines, Festival Supermall, Greenfield Development Corporation, Megaworld Lifestyle Malls, Ortigas & Company, Shangri-La Plaza Corporation, SM Supermalls, Sta.

The Gilas Pilipinas playmaker was acknowledged as such when he was named to the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship Mythical Five.   Two years later, while playing against one of his chief rivals in Iran’s Mehdi Kamrani, “The Blur” showed that not much has changed but the calendar.  On Monday, September 28, Castro led Gilas to an 87-73 victory over the reigning FIBA Asia champions Iran, with Castro serving notice that he is still the best in these parts while putting the Philippines in any discussion for winning Asia’s most prestigious basketball championship.  Castro tallied 26 points (including two triples), two rebounds, 3 assists, 3 steals versus 5 turnovers. He outdueled Kamrani, who finished with 11 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, two steals versus one turnover.   That win, the Philippines’ first against Iran at the Asian Championships since 1973 (in Manila, no less) placed head coach Tab Baldwin’s troops as favorites to top Group E.   The Philippines didn’t only beat Iran at the point position – they also had the best big man on the court as well.  The Philippines’ naturalized center Andray Blatche outscored Iranian counterpart Hamed Haddadi (who fouled out), 18-10. Both slotmen each grabbed 7 rebounds.  (WATCH: Blatche hits circus layup, swats Kamrani’s shot) Even if you added Kamrani’s back-up in Sajjad Mashayekhi’s points (11) to his total, Castro still proved to be more than a handful. He shot at a high 61% from the field, a far cry from Kamrani’s poor 25% accuracy rate.   Castro shoots at a high percentage because of his ability to drive to the basket. That blinding speed allows him to raid the passing lanes as well as to get to the basket where he can create for teammates such as his two drop passes to Calvin Abueva inside the lane late in the game.  How big a factor was Castro? He scored in every quarter. And of his 4 baskets in the fourth period, 3 came from inside the lane. In contrast, Kamrani didn’t score at all in the second and third frames and contributed only one triple in the fourth period. Without Haddadi, Kamrani failed to rally his team or even provide solid playmaking. Yet even by himself, the 5-foot-10 Castro has shown that he too can carry a team on his small shoulders. In 2013, without an injured Marcus Douthit, the Philippines was defeated in the gold medal match of the FIBA Asia Championships, 85-71. Yet even playing without its naturalized center, the Philippines, largely through the efforts of Castro who scored 18 points, hung tough until the second half when Iran put some distance between the two teams that allowed them to stave off one rally after another.  Terrence Romeo, 23, scored 15 points in Monday’s game for the Philippines. Many feel he is the future of Philippine basketball, both domestically and internationally. But at age 30, Jayson Castro is still the man at the helm. The win over Iran is a huge victory. And with Castro playing heads up ball all tournament long, who knows how far the team will go? The Philippines next plays India tomorrow, Tuesday, September 29, and then it’s off to the quarterfinals. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/107191-gilas-pilipinas-round-two-preview/","title":"Previewing Gilas Pilipinas’ opposition in FIBA Asia round two","date":"Sep 26, 2015 6:16 PM PHT","snippet":"Gilas Pilipinas will face stern tests in round two. Is the book already out on how to play the Philippine nationals?","body":" MANILA, Philippines – So it is the full-court press, that bane of previous national teams, that whipped the Philippine squad into merciless form to crush Hong Kong and Kuwait and propel them into the second round of the 2015 FIBA Asia championship. It is something new for the dribble-set plays or the dribble-drive one sees in the recent national teams. But in Cebu’s basketball scene, the full court press has been a vaunted weapon of colleges and universities in the national inter-collegiate play.  What better way to rattle teams who are not experienced like Hong Kong and Kuwait? The Philippines has the depth to keep this press going as shown in the duo or platoon substitutions. But, have the Philippines tipped their hand quite early in showing that the team, a notorious bad finisher in international ball, has this weapon?  Japan will test the Philippines’ full court press and whatever defenses it has when they battle at 4:30 pm Sunday, September 27. And then Iran, with threats from in the outside and inside, on Monday at 11:45 am  (READ: Gilas Pilipinas second round FIBA Asia schedule) The Japanese have a nimble big man, 6-foot-9 Joji Takeuchi, who shone with 22 points and 19 rebounds as he played the whole game in beating India, 83-65. Yuta Tabuse, a veteran guard, backed Takeuchi with heady plays spiced by 10 points, 8 assists and 7 rebounds.  India got the jump on Japan in the early minutes of their game but Japan’s gutsy defense allowed them to grab a 39-32 halftime lead. India cut the lead in the third quarter but Japan roared back in the fourth period for the much-needed win. Japan and the Philippines carry over 1-1 win-loss records from their group into the second round. In their Group E lurks fearsome Iran and surprise package Palestine, both 2-0. India and Hong Kong are in last place with 0-2.  The Philippines used the full-court press off-and-on against Kuwait, switching to a zone in the third but the Kuwait five were able to end a long scoring drought. The Philippines squared its shoulders and used superior skill to win its second game above 100 points, 110-64.  The Philippines will be on war footing from now despite the top four teams in the second round Group E will enter into the finals. It is quite far-fetched to expect India and Hong Kong to challenge.  In the other second round Group F, China and Qatar, both 2-0; Lebanon and South Korea, both 1-1 rule the roost with Kazakhstan and Jordan bringing up the rear.   But this national squad, like some of their predecessors, become overconfident, especially against Palestine, which rolled out their few plays perfectly, including that beautiful bounce pass that resulted in the go-ahead basket in the last 20 seconds. Sometimes, the team shuffles their feet on defense. A few times there is no take-charge guy in offense, especially when Andray Blatche starts losing gas. Coach Tab Baldwin has been managing Blatche’s energies: using him for a long stretch, then resting him, then putting him back into the lineup. It’s like Blatche is getting a mini-workout to make sure he is ready for the crucial second round games.   Jayson Castro is the leader as his backcourt partner Terrence Romeo, so explosive in the Estonia pocket tournament and the Jones Cup has yet to get his hearings. Calvin Abueva’s explosive offense will be needed, plus the sniping of veteran Dondon Hontiveros and Ranidel de Ocampo.  Marc Pingris, who has surprisingly has been sluggish and was rapped on the forehead by a Kuwaiti, will have to be at the top of his game against Japan and Iran, like Asi Taulava, the experienced slotman.  The next 3 days will be very crucial for the Philippine team’s campaign to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics for the first time since 1972. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/106857-gilas-pilipinas-back-against-wall/","title":"Gilas Pilipinas has back against the FIBA Asia wall","date":"Sep 23, 2015 4:37 PM PHT","snippet":"Anything less than a gold medal means the end for the Philippines' 2016 Olympic dream. Can they bounce back from their unexpected opening loss to Palestine?","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The final buzzer rang out through the Changsha Social Work College Gymnasium as if it were wake-up call to Filipino basketball fans. It was irritating confirmation that what had transpired over the last several minutes was not a dream, but rather the most unconscionable outcome that could’ve been conceived.  Gilas Pilipinas, ranked 31st in the world, had lost to unranked Palestine, 75-73, in their opening match of the FIBA Asia Championship.  The Philippines entered the Rio Olympics qualifying meet as dark horses to emerge with gold against continental giants China, Iran and South Korea, who still loom large. But no one could’ve imagined Gilas – being looped in Group B with Palestine, the 69th ranked Hong Kong and 70th ranked Kuwait – could drop a match in what amounts to the anti-Group of Death.  It was the equivalent of Manny Pacquiao losing to a trial horse from Wyoming, or Francisco Bustamante being hustled by a kid at a bus stop saloon.  The game followed the script early on, with the Philippines opening up a 15-point first half lead and naturalized big man Andray Blatche accounting for 14 points and 8 rebounds after 20 minutes.  (IN PHOTOS: Palestine rejoices in upset win over Gilas Pilipinas) Palestine had their own American-born big shot to carry them when things turned bleak in Jamal Abu Shamala, a 6-foot-5 swingman who had previously represented Jordan and played 4 years for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers. Shamala led a second half comeback that was boosted by a switch to a 2-3 zone defense that forced Blatche out of the paint and into the perimeter. There, Blatche’s size and agility were negated and he was reduced to a questionably conditioned big man chucking up 3s (of which he hit just 1-of-7).   With the lane closed off, Palestine was able to exploit the Philippines’ lack of shooters. The Philippines shot just 7-of-30 from 3-point range, with Dondon Hontiveros going 1-of-6 and Ranidel De Ocampo going 0-of-3.  Shamala stunned Gilas fans with a 3 that gave Palestine the lead, 72-71, at 1:35 for the first time since the opening moments. From there, it was a battle of heart and will that Palestine was unwilling to cede.  The Philippines had one last opportunity to win, and it went into the hands of Blatche. Blatche’s 3 arced high, but lacked the distance after Sani Sakakini tipped just enough of it to make the shot drop like a failed North Korean missile into the Sea of Japan.  All credit is due to Palestine, a FIBA Asia-newcomer that fought for survival on the court with the same doggedness their nation had shown in their decades-long struggle for sovereignty. Palestine had none of the fan support that the Philippines did. There was no social media-savvy mass that could make one of their slogans (do they have one?) trend worldwide the way #LabanPilipinas did throughout much of the afternoon. The Palestinians won despite 3 players playing the entire 40 minute-duration, and only 4 players making it to the score sheets.  Both Shamala (26 points and 15 rebounds) and Sakakini (22 points and 14 rebounds) outshined the former NBA center Blatche (21 points and 12 rebounds) in the end.  As Blatche went, so did the Philippines, with only Terrence Romeo (11 points) and Jayson Castro (10 points) making it to double-digit scoring. Marc Pingris started but played just over 6 minutes in which he incurred 4 fouls. Calvin Abueva was able to absorb minutes, grabbing 8 rebounds off the bench.  There are still two games yet to play in the group stage as the Philippines fights to avoid being relegated to the classification round at FIBA Asia for the first time since 2007, where they finished ninth at Tokushima, Japan.  Anything less than a first place finish means the Philippines’ dream of making the Summer Olympics basketball tournament for the first time since 1972 is over.   (READ: FIBA Asia 101: A guide to the Olympic qualifier in China) Next they play Hong Kong, a team they beat handily at FIBA Asia 2013. Hong Kong showed they are there for more than a vacation by pounding Kuwait, 87-50, in their opening match. A second straight loss would be demoralizing for the Philippines. What the men of Gilas Pilipinas said in their post-game huddle after the final buzzer sounded is something only they can know. Each member of the team must ask themselves something in the few hours that remain between that moment and the beginning of the Hong Kong match: how badly do they want to win, and what are they willing to do to achieve that goal? If there’s any lingering doubt, this tournament is as good as over for the Philippine nationals. – Rappler.com Ryan Songalia is the sports editor of Rappler, a member of the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) and a contributor to The Ring magazine.

Unlike similar app-based service Uber, passengers using GrabTaxi will need to specify their destination to get a ride. The system will then send a notification informing nearby drivers of the booking request. But this feature allows drivers to decide whether or not to pick up the passenger based on his or her destination, LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said. The LTFRB board met with representatives of transportation network companies Uber and GrabTaxi on Friday, September 18, after complaints against GrabCar – a private car service also under Grabtaxi – went viral last week. Thousands of commuters were left stranded after a heavy downpour Tuesday night, forcing some to walk home due to the traffic gridlock. On social media, some commuters posted photos of their failed attempts to get a ride through GrabCar. They complained that none of the drivers shown as “available” in the app were accepting their booking requests. Several users also complained that they had to offer hefty tips before they were able to get a ride through the app-based service.  GrabTaxi has since apologized to its passengers, and said the company is looking into new ways to improve their services. At the LTFRB meeting, GrabCar Philippines head Natasha Bautista responded to complaints on the availability of nearby drivers when a passenger makes a booking request. While the app may show that there are dozens of available GrabCar drivers nearby, Bautista explained that not all of those units are available for the requesting passenger. “The perception of the passenger is that there’s one passenger and many drivers around. But what’s really happening, when you look at the system, is that there are maybe around 200 passengers and 100 available drivers. It’s not one is to 100,” she said. Bautista added that some of their GrabTaxi units, who are also authorized to function as “regular” taxis, may show up as available on the app, but may already be carrying passengers who hail them from the streets. Tips as bribes? Last week, former Metropolitan Manila Development Authority “traffic czar” Yves Gonzalez also called out GrabTaxi over its abusive drivers who wait for big tips before picking up passengers. Gonzalez said desperate passengers are forced to offer big tips – which Gonzalez preferred to call “bribes” – just to get a ride home. “Pesos are lost as the current mentality of a lot of the drivers is to wait for a big fat ‘tip’ to be inputted by the rider, who out of desperation to get a ride will succumb to the broken system and offer this ‘tip.’ The system has made a mockery of the traditional definition of a tip, which is something given after a job or service is well rendered,” he said. But Bautista clarified that GrabCar drivers do not see the tips offered by passengers.  “Drivers can’t see the tips, so we can’t say that the drivers only accept if they see the tips. We took out that feature since July,” she said. Bautista added that the company is also planning to remove the tip function from the app.  – with reports from David Lozada/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/105446-grab-apologizes-passengers-improving-services/","title":"Grab apologizes to passengers, says improving services","date":"Sep 10, 2015 10:26 PM PHT","snippet":"'We will not hesitate to investigate and deregister errant drivers.

We would like to apologize to commuters as not everyone was able to get a ride home via our service during the downpour last Tuesday, 8 September 2015,” Grab said in its Facebook page.  Passengers’ complaints on Grab were amplified Tuesday when thousands of passengers were forced to walk home due to traffic bottlenecks caused by torrential rains.  Former Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) “traffic czar” Yves Gonzalez called Grab’s attention saying that while GrabTaxi markets itself as an alternative from abusive taxi drivers, the app instead is being used by drivers to exploit commuters. (READ: Are Grab drivers abusing commuters’ rights?) “Many of our drivers were affected and got stranded, like the rest of Metro Manila, and were not able to accept bookings as they were caught in the gridlock. The flooded road conditions also meant that they would have risked passenger safety and their cars breaking down,” Grab explained.  Acknowledging that there’s still room to “improve our passengers’ experience,” Grab said it will take the following steps to increase the number of bookings accepted. GrabTaxi is a mobile application, founded in Malaysia in 2011, that allows users to book taxis. GrabCar is the app’s alternative form of service which uses cars through licensed partners, in case there are no available taxis during rush hour. ‘Institutionalizing bribery’ One of the causes of passengers’ frustration with the app is its optional “tip” feature, where drivers, according to netizens, wait for big tips before accepting passengers.  “The system has made a mockery of the traditional definition of a tip, which is something given after a job or service is well rendered. A tip in the current system is plainly a bribe to the driver for him to accept a trip,” Gonzalez earlier told Rappler. Grab said the purpose of fixed pricing model is to make sure passengers won’t be given unreasonable fares due to unforeseen circumstances on the road.  “In the event that these happen, the tip function allows us to balance out high demand during low supply situations without forcing passengers to pay a surge. There have been varying viewpoints on the value of this feature, and we commit to reviewing it to better suit the market,” Grab said. On complaints about abusive drivers, Grab said: “We will not hesitate to investigate and deregister errant drivers. We urge passengers to rate our drivers and give proper feedback in our app so that we may be able to take corrective actions, if any.” The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has already asked Grab to explain complaints against its choosy drivers.

Along the capital’s major roads, like EDSA and Taft Avenue, people started walking home due to the lack of available public transportation. Those with vehicles endured hours on the road due to bottlenecks. (READ: Palace: MMDA ordered to manage heavy traffic Tuesday night) Netizens took to social media to vent their frustration on the traffic situation. Among the posts that made rounds on the Internet were from frustrated GrabTaxi and GrabCar users, who pointed out how the app-based transport services added to their frustration.  On Facebook, former Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) “traffic czar” Yves Gonzalez posted about the case of a student who was waiting for a GrabCar driver to accept her offer. The driver, it turned out, was just beside her, ignoring her all along. “The experience of this girl (posted on Jason Cruz’s thread) would be funny if only it wasn’t the most perfect example of what’s obviously wrong with GrabTaxi/Car’s current booking system, which gives choosy drivers total control over the hapless commuter,” Gonzalez said. While GrabTaxi markets itself as an alternative from abusive taxi drivers, Gonzalez noted that the app instead is being used by drivers to exploit commuters. “The current booking system of Grab (the company) unduly promotes the interests of the peers (both driver and operator) to the detriment of the rider or commuter. It has institutionalized two prohibited principles in taxi-type common carriers: asking for additional payment on top of the stated fare, and refusal to convey due to the intended destination of the commuter,” Gonzalez told Rappler. GrabTaxi is a mobile application, founded in Malaysia in 2011, that allows users to book taxis. GrabCar is the app’s alternative form of service which uses cars through licensed partners, in case there are no available taxis during rush hour.  Institutionalizing bribery? According to Gonzalez, the current “tip” system is nothing more but a bribe for the driver to accept a trip. This, plus the thousands of hours and pesos lost in the platform is not in the best interest of the commuter. “Pesos are lost as the current mentality of a lot of the drivers is to wait for a big fat ‘tip’ to be inputted by the rider, who out of desperation to get a ride will succumb to the broken system and offer this ‘tip.’ The system has made a mockery of the traditional definition of a tip, which is something given after a job or service is well rendered,” he said. The current set-up, he added, puts commuters in a helpless state, forced to resort to bribing Grab drivers. “Commuters also have no resort when no driver wants to accept their trip, even if there are hundreds of peer vehicles claimed to be ‘available’ in his/her area. An intended trip can be offered to hundreds of peer drivers, and not one of them will accept it without a big fat ‘tip’ attached to the offer,” Gonzalez said.  While the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulating Board (LTFRB) or MMDA can apprehend taxis that ask for more payment, Grab just made the “broken system” part of the process, Gonzalez maintained.

The latest report from the Makati Treasury Department showed that from January 2 to August 20, the city has already achieved 90%, or P11 billion out of P12.28 billion of its target revenue collection for 2015. However, Salgado said that prior to Binay’s suspension in June, the total revenue collection had already reached P9.5 billion. “Official financial records will show that Makati has consistently increased its annual revenue collection for the past two decades,” said Salgado, who is also the media affairs head of Vice President Jejomar Binay, who was mayor of Makati for 21 years. “It cannot be denied that the business-stimulating policies put in place by the Vice President during his term, which were continued and enhanced by his son, Mayor Junjun Binay, built and sustained a high level of investor confidence in the country’s financial center,” Salgado said. He added that the city “never incurred” a deficit in the last two decades under the Binays. ‘Bagong Makati’ Last week, Peña released a statement saying that the “transparent and good governance being implemented in the city government of Makati is now gaining ground,” and one proof of this, he said, is the growth in tax collection. “Rest assured that under the ‘Bagong Makati’s (New Makati)’ guiding service principle, we shall serve with transparency, fairness and integrity,” said Peña, who used a term referring to Makati under his leadership. “Everyone can stand proud because equal services will be delivered to the business community and all the people of Makati. Regardless of status and color, together we will enjoy the good life,” he added.  Elected vice mayor, Peña replaced Binay in an acting capacity following Binay’s 6-month preventive suspension order from the Ombudsman. On Monday, Peña’s spokesperson Gilbert delos Reyes denied that the acting mayor was taking the credit from Binay. “Sa tingin ko, hindi naman [‘yun] credit-grabbing. Masaya lang siya (Peña) kasi sobrang taas nung collection at ‘yung projected target ay na-hit agad even before matapos ‘yung two months niya as acting mayor,” Delos Reyes told Rappler. (I think that’s not credit-grabbing. He’s just happy because the collection was high and the projected target was hit even before the end of his two months as acting mayor.) He added that they had been receiving testimonials from residents supposedly lauding Peña’s governance of Makati. “Kaya doon sa pagbabayad ng buwis, consistent sila (That’s why they’re consistent in paying their taxes).” Epal Kid? In his statement, Salgado also slammed Peña’s “flagrant misuse of government funds” by using money from the city’s coffers for print advertisements promoting “Bagong Makati” that appeared in various newspapers on Friday, September 4. Salgado said these “do not serve the public interest at all” and are instead “aimed for self-promotion or [being] ‘epal.’”  “Epal” is a derogatory reference to public officials who advertise themselves using government projects. “The recent print advertisements of Peña are obviously self-serving and merely intended to promote his own image. They do not serve any public information purpose and do not befit Makati’s standing as a financial center,” Salgado added. Delos Reyes came to the defense of Peña, who previously announced his interest to run for mayor in 2016. (READ: Running for Makati mayor? History shows odds will be against Kid Peña) “Walang direct hand d’yan si acting mayor (The acting mayor had no direct hand here),” said Delos Reyes, who is the current officer-in-charge of the Makati Information and Community Relations Department (ICRD). He said that he decided to make use of ICRD’s remaining advertising expenses because the budget allotted budget for it is being underspent, with a utilization rating of 16.68%. According to ICRD records, the approved budget for advertising expenses is at P51.95 million. However, as of July 31, the city government only spent P8.66 million. Delos Reyes said the advertisements are part of the city government’s social marketing program to promote its projects for the youth. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/104966-air-asia-one-centavo-seat-sale/","title":"AirAsia one-centavo seat sale returns","date":"Sep 6, 2015 11:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Promo seats can be booked online from September 7-13, for travel period March 1 – October 29 2016","body":" MANILA, Philippines –  AirAsia Philippines’ one-centavo seat sale returns with promo seats up for grabs for domestic and international destinations.

Print and broadcast carry the drama of the UAAP and the NCAA cage wars, and sad to say, the national team fighting its heart out at the William Jones Cup and the qualification of the women’s team to Group I in the FIBA Asia championship are caught in the middle. The Gilas Pilipinas campaign in Taiwan ended Sunday, September 6 with a 96-67 demolition of the Chinese-Taipei B team. The win capped off a 6-2 campaign, where the Philippine team lost only to Iran and South Korea, their chief rivals in the region. Even as they were putting the finishing touches to a first-ever second place finish, coach Tab Baldwin barked: “Play defense!” in a timeout. As Baldwin rotated his men platoon-wise at times in the tournament, he wants a team that hustles on defense especially on the boards, and passes to create the best opportunity to score. But, the nationals had to fall back on the gutsy penetration of Terence Romeo, who was the team’s most explosive performer before sitting out the final 3 games with an ankle injury, and court-to-court sprint of Calvin Abueva, who scored 20 against USA Select-Overtake on Saturday.  Romeo and Abueva, along with using veterans Jayson Castro, Gabe Norwood and Marc Pingris, have given a new stamp to the team, which were not able to recruit some of the best players in the PBA for various reasons. Using Dondon Hontiveros, Ranidel de Ocampo, Asi Taulava and Gary David in key stretches was another factor behind the team’s good run in the Jones Cup.  This is a squad playing without naturalized NBA veteran Andray Blatche and using the steadying presence of Moala Tautuaa, a 6-foot-8 Fil-Tongan player who failed to get his PH passport before age 16 per FIBA requirements. The team isn’t as star laden as the squad that finished second in the 2013 FIBA Asia but Baldwin has managed to make something out of it.  The team is playing on tryout mode as the lineup will be announced on Tuesday. It is also apparent the Russian team the Philippines beat is a “pulut-pulut” (thrown together) squad, one former PBA coach told this writer. It is also clear that the USA Select-Overload team defeated by the Filipinos are older but they had more gas in their tanks when they rallied to within 3 points.  But the big names in the PBA are not in this team. This is a mix of young and veteran players. And they must follow the baton of Baldwin and his coaching staff.  Baldwin doesn’t like players taking a jump shot or a drive to answer a basket scored by the opponent. He abhors half-hearted defense and fans saw part of that when the Philippines defended gallantly in a losing cause against regional powerhouse Iran.  Because of his no-nonsense approach, interest in the national team has been picking up. Hours before the Philippines vs Chinese Taipei B, the team’s benefactor Manny Pangilinan tweeted that he was pleasantly surprised by the response of basketball fans.

Guest player Dindin Santiago-Manabat had another solid showing with 10 spikes and 3 blocks for 13 points to lead the Lady Bulldogs to a 5-1 carryover record at second place. Myla Pablo, whom head coach Roger Gorayeb urged to assert herself more during the game, did not disappoint with 11 points including key attacks in the second set that overturned the Tigresses’ brief advantage. Jaja Santiago and Jorelle Singh chipped in 10 points apiece. “Our attacks,” Manabat answered in Filipino when asked what NU did right against UST. “We weren’t able to execute what we trained for yesterday in terms of service and receive but we made up for it with our attacks.” The Tigresses, known to be a moody squad on the court, were hesitant from the first serve and displayed their so-called diesel engine tendencies. Playing cautious and gauging their foes at first may have worked for other opponents but against the experienced Lady Bulldogs, it simply spelled disaster. NU quickly created separation and kept UST within a 5-point distance. But they allowed the Espanya crew to close in towards the end of the first set, which gave the Tigresses momentum entering the second to take control of the lead. UST looked more energetic in the second frame but consecutive errors midway, however, opened the door for NU to climb back and build a 2-0 lead. The Tigresses were completely depleted by the third set as the Lady Bulldogs raced to a 4-0 early edge marked by running attacks and well-placed drop balls that found the many holes of UST’s floor defense. The Tigresses found themselves stuck at 10 points in the third set and never recovered. Carmela Tunay had 8 points while Pam Lastimosa added 7 in UST’s losing effort as they slipped to a 4-2 carryover card tied with Far Eastern University.

A special double edition of the Focus Policy Review answers this question","body":"The think tank Focus on the Global South released its policy review which tackled one of the most hotly debated themes in the Philippines until today – land grabbing. The Focus Policy Review has just issued a special double edition of “Understanding Land Grabbing, Land Rights in the 21st Century” intended to guide farmers, land rights advocates and the public in understanding how and why land grabbing persisted all these years in Philippine society. As the lead article underscores, “land grabbing… [has] almost always been framed within the themes of economic investment, human rights, and governance. Underpinning these themes is the issue of power…” because land grabbing is a political issue with economic goals. We need to know the basics about land grabbing—the who, what, where, and how—in order to grasp the complexities of the issue. The paper highlighted that the issues and problems associated with land have become more multi-layered in the 21st century. In the Philippine setting, in particular, a number of “pro-poor” land laws were enacted after the Marcos dictatorship. The enactment of laws were outcomes from the struggles and assertions of social and mass movements in the country under the democratic set-up.  Policy analysts that contributed to the paper pointed out the strong social justice component of the 1987 Constitution, which acknowledged the rights of farmers and peasants to land, of fisherfolk to traditional fishing ground, and of indigenous peoples (IPs) to ancestral lands. In overview, it further discussed the legal instrument which could have provided the needed substance of the Constitution’s social justice component – the passage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). It highlighted that CARP should have helped fulfill the Filipino farmers’ right to land but it has turned into an arena for struggle, taking 27 years for the law to be fully implemented. It emphasized the intention of CARP as a law crafted according to the ideals and interests of landless tillers and agrarian reform advocates. However, it ended up plugged with provisions upholding landed elite interests dominating Philippine Congress.  It elaborated that farmers and fishers do not just have to contend with an agrarian reform program that has not been completed almost three decades now. Complicating the situation not only of those who work on lands that have been targeted for agrarian reform coverage but even those who have been issued CLOAs (Certificate of Land Ownership Award) and titles, is the phenomenon called land grabbing.  The CARP’s 27 years of neglect in implementation made it one of the longest running agrarian reform programs under a democratic form of government. The topics it covered The policy paper zoomed in on the following topics written by different analysts:  It also presented a section that deals with the “International Human Rights Instruments and Legal Tools for Global Governance of Land, Forests, Fisheries, and Natural Resources.” About focus on the global south Focus on the Global South was established in 1995 to challenge neoliberalism, militarism and corporate-driven globalization while strengthening just and equitable alternatives.  We work in solidarity with the Global South – the great majority of humanity that is marginalized and dispossessed by globalization – believing that progressive social change and Global South solidarity are imperative if the needs and aspirations of oppressed peoples, particularly in Asia, Latin America and Africa, are to be met.

In the other collegiate game, the Cebu Institute of Technology – University (CIT-U) finally nailed its second win of the season via a 23-point routing of the University of Southern Philippines Foundation (USPF), 85-62. In the juniors division, the University of Cebu (UC) Junior Webmasters dealt the Don Bosco Technology Center (DBTC) Greywolves its sixth loss, 98-51, to improve its standings to a 3-2 win-loss record. In the other junior contest, the University of San Jose Recoletos (USJR) Baby Jaguars survived a second half challenge mounted by the CIT-U Wildkittens, 77-70, to clinch its second win in four games. With the win, the Warriors has kept its record clean, 5-0, after it has yet to drop a game halfway in the first round of the season. Ian Jefferson Tagapan clinched the best player title after he topscored the Warriors with 22 points, 18 of which he scored in the second half and went 9/16 field goals. He also pulled down 3 rebounds and had 1 assist and 1 block. Charles Pepito was once again very instrumental in the Warriors’ fifth win by dominating the board with 11 rebounds and added 11 points. Both team’s imports, Shooster Olago for USC Warriors and Steve Cedrick Akomo for UV Green Lancers also did not disappoint as they put on a dunking show to the spectators’ delight. Olago finished with 20 points, 7 rebounds, 3 steals and 1 assist. Although Akomo had more presence under the net with 7 rebounds and 7 blocks, he also committed 6 turnovers. He finished with 12 points and managed 3 steals. The Warriors never relinquished the lead after they had immediately taken the upperhand, 12-2, just three minutes into the first half. The closest that the Green Lancers could come was at the start of the second half when they managed to tie the game at 39-all on Francisco Arong’s Layup. However, Tagapan exploded with five baskets, three of them shot from the arc, to widen the gap at 52-42, which silenced all but one of Green Lancers shooters, Akomo, who managed to sneak in two baskets to keep his team at arm’ length. A turnaround fadeway shot from Nicolas Kyle Magat and two baskets from Olago allowed the Warriors to erect a 12-point lead in the last two minutes of the third canto. The Green Lancers’ situation was further complicated when Alwin Aguirre fouled out after committing three consecutive fouls on Caesar Ian Ortega, Pepito and Olago halfway in the final canto. The Green Lancers managed to cut down the Warriors’ lead to 4 points on Jun Kent Manzo’s basket, 70-66, with only 4 minutes remaining. But a triple play from Tagapan, who drew a foul from Jerome Napao, once again put them out of reach. The Green Lancers was awarded a free shot after a technical foul was called on the bench of the USC for improper decorum. Appropriately, Tagapan, who scored the first basket of the ballgame, was also the one who sealed it, allowing the USC a 10-point winning margin. The loss dropped the UV Green Lancers to second place with its 4-1 win-loss card. In the game between CITU Wildcats and USPF Panthers, Joshua Dela Cerna once again topscored with 21 points and 7 rebounds. However, the Wildcats will be missing a player on its next game after Joerio Kristoffer Mumar was ejected for throwing a punch to Lyndon Colina with just seconds left in the third quarter. This will bring to a total of 4 players this season who will undergo 4 hours of community service aside from the penalty of a one game suspension and P5,000 fine. The loss puts the comebacking USPF Panthers at the bottom rung with one more game to play in the first round. In the DBTC Greywolves versus UC Junior Webmasters game in the junior division, the Greywolves held a 1 point lead at the end of the 1st quarter but was not able to sustain it as they not only allowed the Junior Webmasters to wrestle the lead but also trailed as much as 12 points, 28-40, at the break. The Junior Webmasters’ advantage ballooned to 30 points going into the final canto. The Greywolves’ misfortune continued in the fourth quarter with their scorers, Rae Adrian Duque and Juan Miguel Dela Torre, being helped off the court one after the other. Duque was favoring his right knee while Dela Torre had his left foot iced after landing badly on it with four minutes remaining in the ballgame. In the other junior game, the CITU Wildkittens also failed to improve its standings against the USJR Baby Jaguars. The loss gave the Wildkittens a 1-4 win-loss record. There will be no games tomorrow as the Cebu Coliseum will not be available, which was why the games originally scheduled for tomorrow were played today.

But he insisted once more that he is his own man with his own policies.   “I’m going to have to earn this,” Bush said.   He also stood by his earlier remark that immigrants breaking the law to come to the United States did so as an “act of love.”   Bush accused Trump of using “divisive” language and warning such verbal sniping will not help Republicans win the White House.   Clinton, Trump draw fire   The candidates, each looking for a breakout moment, also focused their ire on former secretary of state Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee.   “If Hillary is the candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true,” said neurosurgeon Ben Carson, the only African-American candidate in the field.   “She is the epitome of the progressive, the secular progressive movement.”   Candidates at both the main event and on the debate undercard sought to make an impression on voters – and many aimed at Obama, Clinton and Trump.   They offered withering attacks on Obama’s handling of the Islamic State group; vowed tougher immigration policy; pledged to toe the conservative line on social issues; and stressed they would shred a nuclear deal with Iran on day one of a Republican presidency.   “Under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they’re working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare,” said Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, one of seven candidates on stage for the early forum.   Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief, accused Trump of cozying up to the Clintons and slammed him for flip-flopping.   “Since he has changed his mind on (immigration) amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask what are the principles by which he will govern?” asked Fiorina, who was seen as a top performer in the early event.   Immigration    Trump fired up the immigration debate and infuriated Hispanics in June when he said Mexican immigrants are bringing drugs and crime to the US.   “If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal immigration,” Trump said Thursday.   “He’s saying a lot of the things that everybody thinks and he says them without being embarrassed,” said Brad Roller, in a bar in Cleveland after a campaign event for Senator Marco Rubio.   The candidates in Thursday’s main debate were: Trump, Bush, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, Carson, libertarian Kentucky senator Rand Paul, Kasich, Florida senator Marco Rubio, Senator Ted Cruz and Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey. – Ivan Couronne, AFP/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/101746-harvard-asia-pacific-conference-manila/","title":"Back in MNL: Harvard’s largest student conference in Asia-Pacific","date":"Aug 6, 2015 12:55 PM PHT","snippet":"After a 21-year absence, the Harvard – Asia conference goes back to Manila with the theme 'Confronting Asia's Development Challenges through innovation'","body":" This is a press release from the Harvard Project of Asian and International Relations: MANILA, Philippines – After 21 years, the Philippines is once again hosting one of Asia’s most exciting youth gatherings.

Together they look to fulfill the conference’s 3 goals:  During the 5-day conference the students are exposed to various issues related to politics, economics, culture and business.  This year, DLSU-Manila was chosen to be the partner university. “We want to redefine HPAIR’s standards and bring the conference closer to the issues and problems discussed throughout the conference” said Jonathan Beltran, Executive Director of DLSPAIR.  “We also reinvented the conference experience through increased participation of sponsors and companies throughout the Philippines,” Beltran added.   BDO and The Ayala Corporation will have company sponsored case studies, wherein representatives from the company are present to personally explain the cases. This will be done for the first time in this year’s Asia Conference. The conference will consist of 7 different panels and their corresponding themes: The conference will include special events like International Night, Manila Night, Entertainment Night, field trips and mixers for delegates and speakers.  This year’s HPAIR-Asia Conference will be held at The Makati Shangri-La from August 20 – 24, 2015.  “MANILA2015,” in partnership with Banco De Oro, would not be possible without our academic partners, De La Salle University and Asian Institute Management, our sponsors, Ayala Corporation, Philippine Airlines, RFM Foods Corporation, Grab Taxi, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, Globe Telecom, Phinma, Go Negosyo, and Security Bank, and our official media sponsors, Rappler, When In Manila, ANC, Animo Magazine, RX 93.1 and Magic 89.9.” – Rappler.com For more information, you may visit its official website. "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/101622-sg50-tpp-america-firm-commitment-asia-kerry/","title":"#SG50: Trans-Pacific Partnership is America’s ‘firm commitment’ to Asia – Kerry","date":"Aug 5, 2015 5:30 PM PHT","snippet":"'...Looking ahead, I can assure you we are not going to turn away from this initiative; we are not going to slow down – not at all'","body":"Editor’s Note: US Secretary of State John Kerry was in Singapore on Tuesday, August 4, ahead of an ASEAN forum in Malaysia.

Delivered on August 4, 2015, at the Singapore Management University, Singapore Thank you very much. I’m really glad I practiced going up the stairs. I was listening to – well, first of all, thank you, Ambassador Wagar. You are doing a terrific job here, and I’m delighted that our friendship on a personal level continues. And Ho Kwon Ping, thank you. I enjoyed our conversation before we came in here learning about your beginnings at Stanford University and your similar opposition to the war at that time, and I’m really delighted that you have put your considerable talent to work here on behalf of SMU. And I know that they are thrilled. As I was listening to you going through my history of prosecutor, lieutenant governor, and senator for 28 years, I couldn’t help but think how today being in public life is tough. It’s a different ballgame. And I was reminded of that just before I became Secretary of State and after I had run for president. I was walking through the airport and this fellow points. I could see the sign of recognition in his stopping and staring. And he said, “Hey you, aren’t you – anybody ever tell you you look like that Kerry guy we sent to Washington?” And I said, “Yeah, they tell me that all the time.” He says, “Kinda makes you mad, doesn’t it?” So you get the picture, and it’s tough out there, ladies and gentlemen. But I am really pleased to be here in beautiful and dynamic Singapore. I want to thank Prime Minister Lee, who I met with earlier today, for his generous conversation. I want to thank the people of the country for a warm welcome, and I thank you for the partnership on some of the region’s toughest issues from climate change and energy policy to international trade, and of course, security in the South China Sea. On these challenges and more, Singapore has consistently played an extremely constructive and positive role. I want to express my appreciation to Ambassador Wagar. I’ve known him for some time, and I can tell you that his energy and his confidence are really the ideal match for the fast pace and the optimistic view that Singapore has of the future. And we’re blessed – if I can brag for a moment, we are blessed with a tremendous embassy staff here in Singapore, and I am particularly grateful for that because with all that is going on, believe me, they are working overtime and underpaid. And I can’t do anything about that. Except exploit them further. I am really pleased to be able to be here under the auspices of the Singapore Management University, particularly in the 50th anniversary of Singapore’s independence. Singapore’s journey, as all of you know, was shaped by the vision of its leader Lee Kuan Yew. And I had the privilege of meeting with him really more times than I deserved as a young senator, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I have to tell you I learned an enormous amount from this man. His analysis of the dynamics of the region, of the surrounding countries, his ability to tell me about China and other places 20 years ago, 25 years ago, gave me insights that were as valuable and remain among the most insightful that I have gained in any of my travels, and I’m grateful for that. Obviously, all of you live Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy in a different way. It’s known to all of you. After presiding over the difficult birth of this country, he served as prime minister for a quarter century, and then senior minister and minister mentor for another two decades. And he was a founder of ASEAN and a visionary economic leader under whose guidance this island nation transformed itself into truly one of the most prosperous and successful societies on the face of this planet. We see that success in the strong national identity that Singapore’s ethnically diverse population has forged. We see it in the contrasts of Marina Bay, where the old city center is nestled among buildings that seem almost literally to scrape up against the sky, while preserving tradition without sacrificing the possibilities of the future. And we see it in Singapore’s colleges and universities, whose graduates are equipped not with knowledge alone, but with a relentless desire to continue learning, to break the barriers, to go out there and do significant things, growing and leading. In America, it is not an exaggeration to say to you that we think of Singapore with admiration and respect. You are an important strategic partner to the United States, which is why I wanted to come here today to talk about American engagement and about our shared economic future. After all, the United States is also a Pacific nation. We have been for centuries, and we are proud of that. And we know that our security and our prosperity are increasingly linked to this region. That is why we continue to move forward boldly with the rebalance that President Obama initiated in 2009. It’s why we have modernized our longstanding alliances, reinforced our engagement with ASEAN, which I will leave for after this speech and spend the next two days at. And it is why we have taken an even more active role in the APEC Forum, and worked to elevate the East Asia Summit as a venue for dealing with political and security issues in the region. It is why we’ve invested time, from President Obama on down, to develop strong bilateral partnerships in the region. And that includes a comprehensive relationship with China that allows us to address differences directly, candidly while making progress on shared interests. We just had a two-day meeting about a month ago in Washington called the Security & Economic Dialogue. We focused on every issue between us, including, of course, the South China Sea. And I will tell you that China was particularly helpful with respect to the Iran negotiations and the responsibilities that they were willing to assume in helping to advance that complicated negotiation. Our commitment to the notion of Pacific nation and an engagement level that is increased in the region is why – 70 years after the end of World War II – we are promoting a stable, transparent, and rules-based order for the 21st century that will encourage cooperation among all Asia Pacific countries. Now, one of the most important parts of our rebalance is our agenda for shared prosperity in the region – an agenda that begins with trade. Last week in Hawaii, we made progress, good progress, in our negotiations towards one of the most significant trade agreements in history, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP as you know it. This negotiation includes Singapore, the United States, and 10 other countries along the Pacific Rim. Together, these countries account for nearly 40 percent of the world’s economy. As with any complex negotiation – and I’ve watched them for years in the Senate, voted for them, may I say, for the trade agreements – there remain details to be hashed out, but the reasons why each of the TPP countries are pressing on to work through tough negotiations or even some of the most sensitive issues of those negotiation is very, very clear. ‘Raising standards’ First, no country can expect its economy to grow simply by buying and selling to its own people. It’s just not going to happen. It defies the law of economics. Trade is a job creator and it is a prosperity builder, period. In Singapore and the United States, we know this. In fact, our commercial relationship actually extends back more than a century and a half to when a person by the name of Frederic Tudor, an entrepreneur from my home region in New England, thought it would actually be a good idea to ship something that New England had a lot of – ice. Shipping ice to warmer ports of the world, including Singapore. As improbable as that sounds – and people did laugh – it worked, and an importer by the name of Whampoa became Singapore’s first king of the ice trade. And from that humble beginnings have come extraordinary things. Under the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement – which is having its 11th anniversary this year – two-way commerce between us has increased by 50%; and that translates into greater prosperity for both our countries, even though you make your own ice now. But the Trans-Pacific Partnership is about a lot more than just creating economic opportunities, and this is really important to focus on. It’s about raising standards. This agreement initiates a race to the top, not a race to the bottom. Under this pact, every participant will have to comply with core international labor and environmental standards; every participant will have to refrain from using under-age workers, unsafe workplaces; every participant will have to ensure that state-owned companies are actually competing fairly with ones that are privately owned; and every participant will have to fight trade-related bribery and corruption, ensure free and open digital trade, and safeguard intellectual property. Because major economies are committing to TPP’s high standards, its influence will be felt not just through the region but well beyond. It will send a message to people within the TPP and outside of support for good governance, transparency, accountability. It will bear witness to what we have seen in both Singapore and the United States – that sustainable development and prosperity are nurtured by the freedom to innovate, experiment, and compete economically on a level and open playing field. The TPP is also a tangible means of demonstrating America’s firm and enduring commitment to the security and prosperity of the Asia Pacific. We know – and we know this because people tell it to us – that our presence is not just welcome, it’s requested in many places; that it matters economically and diplomatically, politically, and not least of all, it matters from a perspective of security. I say to you today that the United States will continue to work with our partners to promote a stable, rules-based order for the Asia Pacific, and the TPP will spur momentum in that effort. For example, the TPP is helping to deepen our trade relations with ASEAN members as they prepare to launch the ambitious ASEAN Economic Community later this year. And that’s going to be good for the United States and for the region. It’s good for our trading partners. It’s good for companies and it’s good for workers here in Singapore. So trade is obviously a central part of our agenda. It’s part of our agenda for shared prosperity in the region, but it’s by no means the sum total of our economic engagement, and I want to underscore that. The second arena that demands our attention is investment. We all know that in the 21st century a nation’s interests and the well-being of its people are advanced not just by troops or by diplomats, but significantly by entrepreneurs and executives – by the businesses they build, the workers they employ, the students they train, and the shared prosperity that they create. In this sense, economic policy is foreign policy and foreign policy is economic policy, which explains why American businessmen and women are, frankly, some of the best ambassadors that my country has. The fact is that many U.S. companies don’t just do well when they invest overseas; they also do good. And that’s particularly true in Southeast Asia. Doing business right American businesses have been major investors in ASEAN economies for decades now. In fact, U.S. foreign direct investment in the region is larger than Chinese, Japanese, and Korean investments combined. I’ll bet you didn’t know that. And ASEAN countries are now returning the favor. Between 2001 and 2012, the growth in ASEAN investments in the United States exceeded that from all other regions of the world. That’s a remarkable change. It’s due primarily to investors from Singapore, increasingly from other places like Malaysia, and it’s strengthening the foundation for cooperation that we’ve been working so hard to build. But it’s not just the quantity of the investments that matter. You have to look underneath the radar here. It’s also the quality. When Americans invest in countries, I’m proud to tell you without any sense of arrogance, but I think it’s a characteristic of American business that they try to invest responsibly. In contrast to investors from some countries, U.S. firms from Microsoft to Pepsi tend to hire and train local employees. Instead of recklessly polluting the environment, more and more U.S. companies invest in clean energy and other practices that holds local environments harmless. And instead of actually contributing to corruption – which, unfortunately, as I’ve traveled the world I’ve seen in too many places and in too many places is considered business as usual – the United States has made it illegal for its citizens to engage in corrupt practices abroad. And we are doing everything that we can to enforce those laws. Doing business right is part of Singapore’s brand, and it’s what – it’s really in the end what the best firms from America and Singapore both stand for: responsible investment, transparency, accountability, honesty, and a close match between promise and performance. It’s why U.S. companies that have started to invest in Myanmar report publically on how they are living up to their commitments on transparency and respect for human rights. Coca-Cola, for example, has set the gold standard for reporting on its human rights and anti-corruption due diligence efforts, and it is spending millions of dollars to support local communities and improve access to water and sanitation in the country’s villages and towns. This kind of commitment to high standards is how we ensure that foreign direct investment is a win-win proposition, benefitting both halves of the investment equation. And it’s also how we build a deep reservoir of trust between the United States business community and the community of ASEAN nations. I think in many ways it is America’s comparative advantage, and therefore you can bet we’re going to stick with it. Now, another comparative advantage that both of our countries enjoy is a commitment to innovation and entrepreneurship – and I’m sure you’re digging into a lot of that here given the Wharton and other background that you have in the context, not to mention the fundamental experience of Singapore, which understands business as well as any country in the world. American firms have been allowed fundamentally to be global pioneers from the iPhone to the Internet, and I could go on with a longer list, obviously. This is a model worth sharing. And today, I am pleased to announce the launch of an “American Innovation Roadshow” across Asia that will be led by senior members of my economic team and include Chief Innovation and Technology Officers from leading U.S. companies. The purpose of this Roadshow is to engage young entrepreneurs on how to grow their businesses. And the Roadshow will also engage government officials in the region on how to create the favorable environment for entrepreneurship and innovation. The first stop will be right here in Southeast Asia. And I am pleased that my senior advisor Ambassador David Thorne, who is here with us, who has been focusing on promoting entrepreneurship in many countries, is going to lead a delegation to Indonesia and to Vietnam in short order. Now, just as important, all of us – in government and business alike – have to bear in mind that the ultimate measure of our success is going to be determined not by whether or not we have enabled economies to grow, or to just grow, but by how sustainable and inclusive that growth turns out to be. After all, you can’t build a sound economy on a bubble; we need the kind of foundation that only new and truly exciting industries provide and that permits everyone to enjoy respect for their dignity and for their potential. Climate This brings me to the third item on our agenda for shared prosperity that I just want to underscore here today. A clean energy revolution is staring us in the face, waiting for us to grab it, in order for us to address the urgent problem of climate change but simultaneously boosting economies all across the globe. Now let me underscore what President Obama has been saying and we’ve been talking about for years now: Climate change is a crisis that waits for no one and it respects no border; but there is still time for us, according to scientists, to cut greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the worst consequences still from happening. And anyone who tells you otherwise is just plain wrong and not operating off of scientific fact. The science shows that there is still a window of opportunity for us to shift course. But let me tell you something: That window is rapidly closing. So we need to take a “full speed ahead” approach. And that means setting ambitious targets and coming together in support of a truly meaningful climate change agreement in Paris this December. That’s why we went to China two years ago and I engaged with the Chinese in order to bring them, hopefully, to the table, and they came. And together we set targets, and that helped to provide for an agreement in Lima, and that will help provide for an agreement in Paris. The solution to climate change is absolutely as clear as the problem itself, and that is transformed energy policy. Climate change is a danger to everyone, but it’s also an enormous economic opportunity. It’s a chance for all of us to make the right choices about conservation; about wind, solar, hydro; about fuel, utility standards; about the kind of buildings you build, the kind of energy sources with which you power your businesses; and about setting ambitious targets to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. My friends, countries representing about 60% of global greenhouse gas emissions have amazingly already announced post-2020 targets to reduce emissions. This includes Singapore and also the United States where, under President Obama’s leadership, we have increased our wind and energy production more than threefold and raised our solar energy production by a factor of ten. And just this week, President Obama unveiled his final Clean Power Plan, which sets ambitious and historic carbon pollution standards for existing power plants in the United States. Now, I’m not suggesting that tackling climate change is easy. It’s not an automatic. If it were, we would have solved the problem some time ago, because we’ve been beating around the edges of it for more than 20 years. When the science first revealed what we were facing and we began to feel the devastating impacts in the form of heat waves, floods, historic droughts, ocean acidification, and more, people began to understand the connection. All you have to do is look at the TV today and see the fires raging in a four-year drought in California and flooding all across part of this region to the west. Make no mistake: It is crunch time now. And the good news is we know what we have to do. There’s also good news in this. Our nation became wealthier during the 1990s than in any other period since we had no income tax and lived in the 1920s – more wealth created, and it was created by a $1 trillion market with one billion users. It was the high-tech communications computer boom. The energy market that we are looking at is today potentially a $6 trillion market with four to five billion users, and that will grow to nine billion users over the course of the next 30 to 40 years. Think about that. It’s the biggest market in human history. And the possibilities of what we can do and create jobs by the millions and solve the problem at the same time is stunning. I am absolutely confident that we can summon the resolve to get the right kind of agreement in Paris. And we can carve out a path towards a clean-energy future. Pathways to progress Now, this brings me to the fourth and final item on our shared prosperity agenda: growing the middle class and connecting its members to the global marketplace. Here, there are several pathways to progress. One is to make sure that the leaders of the future are getting the training and education that they need to thrive in a highly competitive economy, and you obviously have already embraced that. Witness this university that is 15 years now in reality. By 2030, the Asia Pacific will be home to two-thirds of the global middle class, and 65 percent of the population in ASEAN countries is below the age of 35. This region’s future depends on the choices that these young people get to make. That’s why the United States is investing in President Obama’s Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative – YSEALI, as we call it. YSEALI offers professional training, study, and grant opportunities in the United States and across this region. And through this initiative, we are engaging the next generation of great leaders in every field of endeavor, empowering them to be able to develop valuable business skills and to create the networks that will shape the future of ASEAN. We also need to remove the barriers that remain to the advancement of women. No country can prosper without the contributions of half of its people. In fact, experts believe that women’s full participation in the economy can boost GDP worldwide by some 12 percent in the next 15 years. Here in Singapore, where technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship thrive, my government has joined with Hewlett-Packard to encourage young women to think about careers in science and technology. And under something called the Lower Mekong Initiative, with support from private sector partners, we will soon open a center in Cambodia to help women entrepreneurs start and scale up their businesses. Finally, we need to do more to connect markets and to create a fully integrated trans-Pacific community. An important part of that effort is tackling the infrastructure deficit in the region. That’s why we are committed to finding innovative ways to finance modern, sustainable infrastructure development – through new loan programs at the World Bank, at the Asian Development Bank, and by mobilizing the resources and sophistication of American capital markets. Now, these efforts have already resulted in new wind farms in Vietnam and new geothermal production in Indonesia. And at the same time, we recognize that there remain many opportunities to be able to improve the region’s infrastructure and to create good jobs. China, for example, as everybody knows, has established the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. We support that effort, but we want that effort to be able to be transparent and accountable in the same ways other international financial institutions are. But we believe it’s important for China to make contributions to global development and responsible investments in regional infrastructure. And these efforts can be complementary to existing efforts, but they need to meet the same high standards that those other efforts do also. So my friends, this is a moment of exceptional opportunity for the Asia Pacific. We are nearing the completion of an historic Trans-Pacific Partnership on trade. We’re investing at unprecedented levels and promoting high standards when it comes to business practices. We’re doubling down on clean energy and creating the right kind of growth. We’re working together to upgrade education and grow the middle class. And looking ahead, I can assure you we are not going to turn away from this initiative; we are not going to slow down – not at all. We are determined to deliver on the strategic and economic promise of our era. That can be the legacy of this generation and of this century. And there’s nothing more in keeping with the traditions of Singapore than to look over the horizon to the future for the connections that would create prosperity, harmony, and security for tomorrow. In October of 1967, Lee Kuan Yew made his first official visit to the United States. He traveled to Washington and he spoke with President Lyndon Johnson at the White House. Then as now, there were no shortage of challenges for our leaders to discuss. But Prime Minister Lee was confident about what our two countries could build together. He said simply that “patience and prudence, resolution and restraint will see the world through to a better and a more secure future.” Now, we all know that the successful management of world affairs is, as I said at the beginning of my comments, much more complicated today than it was a few years ago, certainly much more complicated than the era in which I and many peers looking out here grew up in – a bipolar world of Soviet Union and the West and a confrontation of the Cold War which finally ended in 1990 and released all kinds of pent-up forces in many parts of the world. That’s what we’re coping with today – a clash with modernity of culture and history and tradition and fear. There is much about what is to come that remains uncertain, my friends, but I have absolutely no doubt that the path to shared prosperity requires a combination of what Lee Kuan Yew was talking about of prudence, of patience, of resolution and restraint. The United States seeks what most people in this region seek: a place where countries come to each other’s aid when natural disasters strike or humanitarian emergencies arise; a region where the legitimate rights of every state – big or small – are honored; a region where borders are respected and countries cooperate to prevent small disputes from growing into larger ones; a region where disagreements are settled openly, peacefully, and in accordance with the rule of law; and a region where the human rights of each and every person are fully respected. That means we must never stop adapting to trying to do better. Lee Kuan Yew was, in fact, a master at adapting his country to the challenges of a new era. And asked about the source of Singapore’s strength, you know what he said? It’s “ideology free.” Obviously, we are facing a time of many different cross-currents of ideology, religion, sectarianism, and so forth. That’s what makes it so complicated, with particular parts of the world witnessing upheaval and unprecedented violence. Governance is more demanding as it deals with greater religious, political, and ideological complexity in a world of instant communications. People may not have a job, but they’ve got a cell phone. People may not have a future, but they’re connected to the world. And the same forces that bring us the complexity actually bring us greater opportunity. That’s the way you need to look at it. And so we have to face the world and all its challenges, frankly, with the confidence in the road we have traveled, in who we are, in our ability to compete. I think Singapore understands this. And I am confident as I look around this room today and I look at the purpose and the investment of this institution of learning, we will create stronger partnerships, we will move towards more sustainable growth, more prosperity, more opportunity, and we will be able to do that not for some, but for all of the people. That should be our goal, and the United States will work with you to try to achieve it. Thank you all very, very much. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/99371-georgia-accuses-russia-land-grab-breakaway-region-pipeline/","title":"Georgia accuses Russia of ‘land grab’ near breakaway region","date":"Jul 14, 2015 9:21 PM PHT","snippet":"Georgia decries Moscow's \"creeping annexation\" of its territory after Russian border guards moved border markers further into Tbilisi-controlled area, leaving a portion of an international oil pipeline in territory under Russian control","body":" TBILISI, Georgia – Georgia decried on Tuesday, July 14, Moscow’s “creeping annexation” of its territory after Russian border guards moved border markers further into Tbilisi-controlled area, leaving a portion of an international oil pipeline in territory under Russian control. The move left a small portion of the Baku-Supsa pipeline, which transports Caspian oil destined for Western markets, under Russia’s effective control.  “This is yet another aggressive action by Russia against Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Georgian Foreign Ministry spokesman David Kereselidze told Agence France-Presse. “Russia continues its creeping annexation of Georgian territory and threatens peace and security in the entire region,” he said. “We call on the international community to condemn Russia’s illegal actions.” Kereselidze said that Russian border guards had installed last week border markers, which read “State Border of South Ossetia,” some 450 meters from Georgia’s main east-west highway, leaving a 1.6-kilometre segment of the Baku-Supsa pipeline out of Tbilisi’s control. The United States’ ambassador to Georgia, Richard Norland, denounced the move as “provocative and humiliating.” Georgian Energy Minister Kakha Kaladze told journalists that the pipeline’s section could be rerouted in the event of issues with its operation.  Russian troops have been installing barbed wire around South Ossetia since Tbilisi’s defeat in the brief 2008 Russia-Georgia war over control of the Moscow-backed separatist region. After the war, Moscow recognized South Ossetia – along with the Georgian separatist enclave of Abkhazia – as independent states and stationed thousands of troops in the regions that make up some 20 percent of Georgian territory.  The breakaway regions, whose self-proclaimed independence has been recognized by only a handful of countries, are heavily dependent on Russia’s military and financial support.  The Baku-Supsa pipeline, also known as the Western Route Export Pipeline, runs from Azerbaijan to Georgia’s Black Sea terminal of Supsa and can transport up to 100,000 barrels of oil a day. Last year, some 31 million barrels of crude were pumped through the 830-kilometre pipeline.  – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/98638-australian-senator-threatens-pm-abbott/","title":"Australian senator threatens to grab PM’s testicles","date":"Jul 7, 2015 4:14 PM PHT","snippet":"An independent Australian senator Tuesday, July 7, threatens to physically intimidate Prime Minister Tony Abbott if he does not limit coal-seam gas exploration","body":" SYDNEY, Australia – An independent Australian senator Tuesday, July 7, threatened to physically intimidate Prime Minister Tony Abbott, using illegal rugby tactics including grabbing his testicles, if he does not limit coal-seam gas exploration. Glenn Lazarus, a former rugby league prop and a senator for the eastern state of Queensland, said he submitted a petition to Abbott calling for health impact assessments, exclusion zones and community consultations over mining developments near residential, agricultural and farming areas. Lazarus, dubbed the “brick with eyes” in his rugby heyday, added to an anti-CSG protest in Sydney that he was prepared to use a range of tactics on the Australian leader if he does not respond to the community’s concerns. “I am prepared to go and squirrel grip, squirrel grip, the prime minister,” Lazarus added, in apparently light-hearted comments. “If that doesn’t work I have got other things up my sleeve, like the grapple tackle, the chicken wing and even the crusher tackle, and if that doesn’t work, I’m prepared to use the Hopoate tactics.” The “squirrel grip” is a testicle-grabbing tackle, the “chicken wing” involves twisting or bending an opponent’s limbs and the “crusher” is pinning the head of a player against the tackler’s chest. “Hopoate tactics” is named after former Australian and Tongan rugby league player and serial offender John Hopoate, who in 2001 was banned for two weeks for inserting his finger in the anuses of several opposition players. Lazarus, previously a member of flamboyant billionaire Clive Palmer’s party in the upper house Senate before he quit to become independent, also said he had threatened to “shirtfront” Abbott over the coal-seam gas issue.  Abbott in October vowed to “shirtfront” – an Australian Rules football term in which a player charges an opponent – Russian president Vladimir Putin over the July 2014 crash of Malaysia Airlines MH17 in rebel-held eastern Ukraine. Australia is one of the world’s largest gas exporters and Lazarus said he was fired up about the issue as deposits and mines were causing “havoc to the residents that are living there”. Abbott had no immediate reaction. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/97168-things-ph-learn-from-singapore-food-culture/","title":"The Philippines can learn from Singapore’s food culture","date":"Jul 2, 2015 7:35 PM PHT","snippet":"'We need to invest in the right physical and cultural infrastructure to celebrate Filipino food'","body":" There’s more to Filipino food than just Jollibee. I’ve used this rebuttal a few times whenever I find myself educating foreigners about the diverse wonders of Filipino food. Even though I adore my crispy Chicken Joy just as much as the next homesick OFW (2 pieces, please!), I’m quick to defend our cuisine from being reduced to a single fast food chain or the ever mind-boggling delicacy of balut (developing duck embryo.)  I don’t blame these foreigners for what they do not know though. I can’t. For unlike our Asian neighbors Thailand and Vietnam, Filipino food is vastly underrated and underexposed in the international foodie scene. Pad thai. Beef pho. While many have savoured these dishes, few have known the joys of sisig or kare-kare.  It almost seems that even with our food, we’re always making the headlines, yet never fully harnessing the power of our potential. Almost three full years have gone by since the prophecy of popular American TV personality and chef Andrew Zimmern, who resolutely declared that Filipino Food was the next big thing.  Perhaps our recent ranking as the world’s second best food destination, according to the CNN Facebook poll, is a sign that the Filipino Food Movement is finally gaining some precious traction. But, I believe that it takes more than public opinion to really sway the world’s palates our way. Living in foodie haven Singapore and traveling frequently to other delightfully delicious destinations (say that three times fast!) within the region has helped shed light on what and how local cuisines truly make it abroad. The secret is a thriving food culture back at home and a local appetite so ingrained in the daily life of its citizens from all walks of life. Similar to building better airports to cope with the country’s spotlight as the next big travel destination, we need to invest in the right physical and cultural infrastructure to celebrate Filipino food. Here are four things I believe that the Philippines can stand to learn from Singapore’s food culture.  An authentic experience The humble hawker center is the epitome of what I love about Singaporean food culture. These markets house an array of individual vendors selling ready-to-eat street food from small booths.  But most importantly, it’s a shared public space that simply doesn’t give a damn about who you are and what you do, as long as you bring an appetite for cheap, authentic local food.  Anyone, from the gray-haired tissue vendor to the corporate exec, is welcome to have breakfast, lunch, dinner and everything else in-between here. And yes, supper too. The Filipino carinderia is similar to a hawker center, but unlike Singapore, it doesn’t transcend race or class. Not everyone feels safe eating kanto (street) food or grabbing lunch from the sari-sari store. While markets like Mercato or Legazpi Village exist, their doors are simply not as accessible to those who are not in the upper-middle class or higher.  A taste of history Often, the first place I bring friends visiting Singapore is Lau Pa Sat – a popular hawker center converted from a historic building, one known for its graceful colonial architecture.  Given the rich history of the Philippines, with its gorgeous churches and majestic forts, why not preserve old buildings as monuments to our local food instead of tearing them down? Not only will tourists and locals get a taste of Filipino food, they’ll also get a generous helping of Philippine culture on the side too. A melting pot of Filipino cuisine Singapore is, quite literally, a tasty melting pot of different cultures.  Endless stalls of local delights also serve as gastronomic ambassadors for the 3 main ethnic groups in the country – Malay, Chinese and Indian. Filipino cuisine is even more diverse – with influence from the Spaniards, Americans and the various local flavors from over 7,000 islands.  But unlike the relatively tiny city of Singapore, the Philippines is a vast archipelago. Unless you make it a point to visit other provinces, one could live out entire lives without being exposed to the sheer breadth of Filipino cuisine. But what if you could bring these provincial flavors to the bigger cities? Since Manila is the top tourist gateway into the Philippines, why not make it the culinary capital of authentic Filipino food from all over the country?  Example of reimagining local food. Right side: Eggs benedict on prata bread. Left  side: White and dark chocolate champorado.   Rediscovering the Filipino foodie Part of what feeds the foodie industry is being able to reimagine traditional food in new ways or reinvent the experience of eating your favourite food. Take the popular brunch culture in Singapore for example. While inspired by the British, it has become a permanent weekend fixture for both locals and expats. Could we not develop a brunch culture in the Philippines as well? Dishes like adobo, tapsilog and tocino do make for a perfectly hearty brunch meal. Some Singaporeans have even tapped into the trend by adopting classics like eggs benedict but replacing the muffin with prata, a flour-based pancake. Perhaps we can do the same with a pandesal? This is but one of many ways we can help Filipinos rediscover their old favorites. The Philippines has all the right ingredients to become a truly international foodie destination. So long as we can cultivate a homegrown cultural appetite for local cuisine, global tastebuds will soon follow. All we need to do is stir the pot in the right direction. – Rappler.com   Rica is a ‘foreign filipina,’ born in Indonesia, raised in the Philippines and working in Singapore.

With sweat pouring from their faces and without any footwear between them and the concrete, young Pinoy kids – they must have been around 9-11 years-old – dribbled what looked like a basketball years beyond its virility and repeatedly threw up shots against a rim on what barely resembled a court. Nevermind that they would surely have blisters on their feet after playing or that the chances of making a shot was drastically low due to the wrongly-angled metal stick that was bent to play the part of a rim, pinned against what was an extremely old pieced of rectangular wood.  Nevermind that they had to stop playing every two minutes whenever a car would pass by, as the vehicle took away the 15-foot gap from one side of the street to the other that was their version of a hardwood floor. The pure joy and ecstasy on these kids’ faces could lift anyone up. For a moment, I forgot that my phone kept buzzing with messages from work or that the Toyota Vios behind me was honking its horn, screaming for me to move forward.  I see it almost every day actually – a similar scene takes place on the street where my dad’s office is. But regardless of when or where you notice such a scenario – whether for the first time or the 100th – it just never ceases to amaze. A few hours later, as I scrambled to find cellular data near courtside at the San Juan Arena to e-mail my game report, I looked to my right and saw arena bouncers and staff participating in a game of halfcourt 4-on-4. Later on, members of the media joined them. When another staff member came out of the dugouts with another ball, those who were erstwhile watching from the sidelines formed their own teams and had their own game.  For brief moments, I forgot what I was doing and just watched. It was so simple, yet it felt so surreal. And it actually happens all the time. Basketball will always be king in the Philippines.  We bask in the glory and success of Manny Pacquiao and the many other great boxers who have – and will continue – to achieve success in the international stage. We love our Azkals for bringing pride to football in our nation. Our volleyball national team are our darlings, and we always make it a point to take pride in how important a role the sport plays here even if it is significantly less popular in other areas of the world.   But basketball is the Philippines’ greatest sporting love. There’s something about it that feels like home. It’s similar to when you go out of town for a few days, maybe even stay in a fancy 5-star hotel room that overlooks a beautiful beach of a beautiful island, but a part inside of you still craves for your own bed, your own living room, your own home-cooked meals. That’s no disrespect to the other aforementioned sports that are absolutely special in their own rights. But it makes sense. England has football. India has cricket. Australia has rugby. We have basketball. It feels like home in our country, and in four years, our country has an opportunity to host the grandest, most extravagant basketball tournament in the world. According to a report released by FIBA in March, the Philippines and China remain as the frontrunnners to land hosting rights to the World Cup. Let’s all be real: the competition is tough. China has yet to host the World Cup, but they have hosted a much bigger tournament: the Olympics in 2008. I haven’t seen their facilities, but they’re likely more state-of-the-art.  Their cities are bigger. Over the past years, it’s become a hotbed for global markers – take Nike, for example, which has sent guys like Kobe Bryant and LeBron James there more than once. Does that put the Philippines at a disadvantage? Should China be considered the favorite? Not so fast. Our country has its own merits. They need arenas to play in? Well, there’s the 52,000-seater Philippine Arena, which has already hosted the opening of the PBA’s 40th season, and, heck, even a Katy Perry concert. There’s the Mall of Asia Arena, which hosted all games of the 2013 FIBA-Asia Championship and the 2013 NBA Global Games when the Indiana Pacers and Houston Rockets came to town for a preseason game. There’s Araneta Coliseum, which might not be as aesthetically pleasing as the two aforementioned stadiums, but has enough history to write a book: from the Thrilla in Manila, to the 1978 World Basketball Championship (FIBA World Cup), to WWE events, and even the Smart Ultimate All-Star Weekend in 2011, when NBA players like Bryant, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, and Derrick Rose, among others, came to town. Hotel accommodations? I’m certain the 5-star accommodations of Shangri-La, The Marriott Hotel, Intercontinental Hotel, or Sofitel would be up to task. Telecommunications? They’re not perfect, but Globe and Smart are more than viable.  “The ingredients are there, between Mr. Pangilinan, his own network, and the people in the federation, but also the network outside the federation to bring all this somehow together,” FIBA Secretary General Patrick Baumann said when the FIBAEvaluation Commission inspected the Philippines in January. “The team has seen all of the facilities that could be part of the overall story of the World Cup here. They’ve seen the venues. They’ve seen the [Philippine Arena] – 52,000 spectators capacity. They’ve seen the Mall of Asia [Arena]. They’ve seen the plans for two venues that would be very good venus to come. They’ve seen the historical piece of venue that is the Araneta [Coliseum], which hosted the World Cup already – World Championship in 1978… it is a really important piece of history.”  I’ll leave comparing the advantages of hosting the 2019 World Cup in the Philippines or China – a decision to be made after final bids are presented in August – up to FIBA, but here’s one more note I have to mention, and that is one asset I believe the Philippines has over China: Puso (heart). Puso has become a cultural mantra in this country to represent fighting pride and honor of our national basketball team in international play. It fits, especially considering that Filipinos usually go up against taller and more superior athletes in FIBA tournaments. But puso is more that just what we see our national team display when they hustle for loose balls or try to rebound against 7-foot basketball behemoths from Senegal or Puerto Rico. Puso represents the love and passion that this country has for the game of basketball. Puso is kids fighting against Manila’s unforgivable heat just to play a game of 3-on-3 so that their dreams of becoming the next James Yap or Mark Caguioa lives another day. Puso is 30, 40-year old arena bouncers and staff spending an hour more just to play the game they love despite standing on their feet during work duty for the entire day. Puso is taxi drivers, waiters, commuters, and many others sacrificing minutes of their working hours, staying outside a sports bar, and crowding a portion of a street, just to catch a glimpse of the conclusion to Game 3 of the NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors; to see what kind of heroics “idol” LeBron James or Steph Curry has in store. Puso is hundreds of Ginebra or Purefoods fans waiting for an hour or two after the game outside the MOA Arena or Araneta Coliseum – heck, even the old Cuneta Astrodome – to catch a wave or smile from PJ Simon, Japeth Aguilar Greg Slaughter, Mark Barroca, or any other Hotshot and Gin King. Imagine if LeBron or Pau Gasol were here. Puso is thousands of Filipinos across the world going to bed with hears broken, tears dropping from their eyes, in the wee hours of the morning after watching Gilas unable to convert a glorious opportunity to grab their first win in the World Cup in 40 years against Argentina. Puso is, a few days later, when Jimmy Alapag hits a 3-pointer down the stretch of overtime, and Filipinos start to tear up again after realizing that, finally, after 40 years, they’re about to gain their first win in the World Cup against Senegal. Puso is strangers at the MOA Arena who have never met each hugging each other in celebration after the curse of Korea was broken by an injured Marcus Douthit-less Gilas in the FIBA Asia Championship – a day in August 2013 that many will never, ever forget. “What should I say? Puso,” said FIBA Evaluation Commission Chairman Lubomir Kotleba in January. “It’s known that puso is not only in the arena; puso is everywhere.” “We saw the puso everywhere we [went].” (READ: Gilas Pilipinas shows the world what ‘puso’ means) “I think that it is a pleasure for the FIBA family to see the Philippines back this level, the international level,” Baumann said. “This is a country that wants to grow, wants to develop, not only in basketball, but in the many areas of society across the country and clearly it does have the ambition to be at the top in our sport.” We know how special basketball is to our country. FIBA knows it.  The rest of the world should know it too. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/95938-womens-softball-gold-sea-games/","title":"Philippines rules women’s softball, earn SEA Games gold","date":"Jun 10, 2015 5:23 PM PHT","snippet":"The Philippines grabbed another gold medal in the 28th Southeast Asian Games by defeating Thailand, 3-0, in the women softball grand finale","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines grabbed another gold medal in the 28th Southeast Asian Games by defeating Thailand, 3-0, in the women softball grand finale at the Kallang Softball Field in Singapore on Wednesday, June 10.  The Philippines scored two runs in the third inning and another one in the fourth, while shutting out their Thai opponents over six innings.

It is republished here with his permission. MANILA, Philippines – Now that we’re down to thirty-eight (38) official candidates for Miss Philippines Earth 2015, did that make my life easier for the usual pageant predictions I share a few days or less before finals night? Not at all. At least not with the ones I am seeing as the likeliest to spoil the very-top-of-the-heap finishers this coming Sunday, May 31. You see, I have comfortably zeroed in on the possible successor of Miss Philippines Earth 2014 Jamie Herrell (who will move on to her duties as Miss Earth 2014 afterwards). Like it or not, this year is going to be a tight-as-a-tick battle between Chanel Olive Thomas (of San Antonio, Nueva Ecija) and Angelia Ong (of the City of Manila) for #1. Between the two, one is definitely getting Earth and the other will have to settle with Air. And frustrating as it may sound, the thirty-six other ladies will have to be contented grabbing the remaining elemental (plus Eco-Tourism) spots in the Top 5. Whoever among them is found most deserving will join Chanel and Angelia in the winning circle. It’s that predictable of a scenario. For now, let me formally present to you the 16 Earth Warriors in my first cut, which is honestly not a lot to holler about. Because in the next trimming, there will be only ten 10 left, and half of this number, or the lower five of the Top 10, are already considered runners-up for 2015 despite equally going through the motions of Q&A and Evening Gowns. The minute another half is called to make the top quintet, the winners will have already been announced, save the rankings. Top 16  Angelia Ong   Diana Mackey  Sofia Loren Deliu  Darlene Hipolito  Alyssa Ashley Calimlim  Chezka Carandang  Chanel Olive Thomas  Carla Valderrama  Alyanna Cagandahan  Darlene Pepito  Aiko Rachelle Caraan   Paris Adele Silva  Jona Sweett  Jian Cayla Salazar  Mhon Theress Menaling   Jocehl Cristoria Three from NCR, 4 from Northern Luzon, 4 from Southern Luzon, 4 from the Visayas and one from Mindanao – that is how I classify the composition of my Top 16. As expected, the 15th and 16th placers on my list are the hardest to fill, but the easiest to replace if need be. But I won’t give you the full satisfaction of knowing those semifinalists anymore. Let’s just say that I can easily give those rankings to the ones graded as #17 or #18. Top 10 It’s the Top 10 that I found tricky. I found myself vacillating back and forth among 3 girls who should make the cut, where only only one of them can move on. The first nine (9) places are already filled up courtesy of Chanel Olive Thomas, Angelia Ong, Diana Mackey (of Cabanatuan City), Alyssa Ashley Calimlim (of Villasis, Pangasinan), Sofia Loren Deliu (of Baguio City), Alyanna Cagandahan (of Santa Cruz, Laguna), Chezka Carandang (of Quezon City), Carla Valderrama (of Siniloan, Laguna) and Mhon Theress Menaling (of Mandaue City).  I had a hard time choosing from among Darlene Pepito (of Ormoc City), Jian Cayla Salazar (of Guinobatan, Albay) and Jona Sweett (of Iloilo City). I did not resort to blind-folded dipping of my hand inside a bag containing their names, though. I made things painless and went for the Best in Long Gown Gold Medalist. How sweet it is then for Jona Sweett as my 10th. Top 5 Now in this segment, I decided to be anti-climactic. No use lingering on the suspense anymore. I already made the choice of Chanel Olive Thomas and Angelia Ong as my personal predictions for Miss Philippines Earth 2015 and Miss Philippines Air 2015, respectively. In addition, I strongly feel that Sofia Loren Deliu would make a wonderful Miss Philippines Eco-Tourism 2015 given her profession and strong advocacies that would serve the environment well. That leaves us with Water and Fire, or the elements that actually rank 3rd and 4th. Diana Mackey is a relatively easy choice for Water. She has been running 3rd mostly in my scoresheet, and I really wouldn’t mind seeing two ladies from the province of Nueva Ecija in the Top 5. It’s my choice of Alyssa Ashley Calimlim for Fire that made me slightly squirm in my seat. It was a toss-up between her and Chezka Carandang or Alyanna Cagandahan to get in. This is where I just made the one hard decision to give up on the ladies from Quezon City and Santa Cruz, Laguna. There are inner workings that I cannot fully expound on anymore, unless someone privately eggs me on to do so. So here, I give you my Top 5 for Miss Philippines Earth 2015, in proper order:  Miss Philippines Earth 2015: Chanel Olive Thomas   Miss Philippines Air 2015: Angelia Ong  Miss Philippines Water 2015: Diana Mackey   Miss Philippines Fire 2015: Alyssa Ashley Calimlim  Miss Philippines Eco-Tourism 2015: Sofia Loren Deliu I stated earlier that the fight between Chanel and Angelia for the crown is going to be tough as nails. Any one of the two making it would make the organizers very happy. They are both sweet, charming, committed and down-to-earth (no pun intended). So it will really boil down to that one final question that will be answered in the penultimate portion of the pageant proceedings. One wrong reply (or choice of words/statements) and it could be game over. But hey, Miss Philippines Air isn’t a bad reward for all the hard work all throughout. It’s just that Miss Philippines Earth will compete in Miss Earth 2015, aside from being long remembered by the faithful fans and followers. Wait, what’s the name of last year’s Miss Philippines Air again? Just kidding. She’s Dian Querrer, of course. For crying out loud, can’t we just have two (2) Miss Philippines Earth 2015 winners for a crazy change? Just this once. – Rappler.com Norman Tinio started pageant-blogging back in 2009 but has already been an avid pageant enthusiast since the early 70s.

Japan was in control of the first two sets before running into some troubles early in the third set.

The Philippine team was unable to regain the upper hand and eventually suffered their second defeat of the tournament. No Japanese player scored in double figures but only one non-libero player didn’t put points on the board. Misaki Yamauchi led the club with 9 points, while Kaori Mabashi pitched in 8. Alyssa Valdez put up 15 points to lead the Philippines. Santiago came up with 7 to provide aid, while Gretchel Santones put up 6.

Two of them are from the Philippines. Otherwise, acts must win at least 3 Yes votes to advance to the next round. Rappler spoke with the two Filipino Golden Acts: classical singer Gerphil Geraldine Flores and the El Gamma Penumbra Dance Troupe, who shared their once in a lifetime experience on the show. The other 2 Golden Acts are Time Machine, a dance act from Japan, and Gao Lin and Liu Xin, acrobats from China.  Gerphil Geraldine Flores: The bearer of classical music 24-year-old Gerphil Geraldine Flores loves her craft so much that she says she’ll never stop reaching for her dream.  Gerphil, a music major (voice) at the University of the Philippines, first joined Pilipinas Got Talent 5 years ago. She said the opportunity was worth it. “I have to say it was a good experience 5 years ago…I’ve learned a lot. Not only that, I’ve also met some good friends from my co-contestants,” Gerphil shared during the phone interview with Rappler.  Gerphil she decided to join Asia’s Got Talent because of the opportunity and knows the challenge ahead of her. “I told myself I’m never going to give up until I reach my dream, And finally when I saw the opportunity, I grabbed it right away. This comes once in a blue moon. So when you see it, you’ll just have to grab it. You’ll never know what’s in store.” During her audition, the judges were impressed – especially music producer David Foster, who pressed the golden buzzer to let her move automatically to the semifinals.  Watch below: {source} <iframe width=”100%” height=”360″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5NTg5eurWE” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe> {/source}   The judges gave her a standing ovation after her performance, with her idol David saying, “Yes! That’s what I am talking about. You certainly did not disappoint anybody in this room. It was really a solid performance and your pitch is great. And I hate people who sing out of tune.  You sang in tune. Good going.” The other judges were just as blown away, with Vanness saying that she was fit to be in a musical, Melanie C pointing out that Gerphil didn’t sound nervous at all, and Anggun saying that it was a beautiful performance. Gerphil, who is a big fan of David, described the experience as “surreal,” saying: “David Foster is one of my ultimate idols… I have no other way of backing out. This is it. He’s really here and I am going to face him, so it’s a challenge. And finally when I was able to sing and he hit the golden buzzer, I really wasn’t expecting that. That was a dream come true for me. It was a big blessing,” she said. She counts Josh Groban and Andrea Bocelli as two of her favorite singers. She also said that given the chance, she would like to sing “The Impossible Dream” from The Man from La Mancha.  She also said that whether she makes it or not to the final round of the show, she will definitely promote classical music to the next generation of audiences.  “Hopefully I’ll be able to influence the younger generation and introduce them the beauty of classical music. I will introduce this by doing crossover because I get to sing modern songs and apply a classical approach to them.” El Gamma Penumbra: Dancing for the Philippine flag After a teary-eyed Anggun hit the Golden Buzzer, tears were shed and hugs were exchanged onstage. Their audition – a shadow play/dance that presented the different cultures around the world – won them an automatic place in the semi-finals. Watch below: {source} <iframe width=”100%” height=”360″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpxXRbse5Ck” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe> {/source}   Judge David Foster thought that the performance was beautiful, saying, “One of the beautiful things about sitting in this chair is I get to see things I would never see in my life. I have no idea how you did it. I have no idea how it works, but I know it was absolutely magical.” Fellow judges Melanie C and Vanness Wu were also in agreement, with Melanie saying that it was mind-blowing and Vanness commenting on how talented the group was at telling stories. But automatically making it through only strengthened the purpose of Filipino group El Gamma Penumbra (“Shadow Rays”), which was to empower the Filipino nation.  “Ang main goal po talaga is to inspire the audience. Kung sa panahon na ‘to na nawawalan ka nang pag-asa, magbibigay kami ng performance na magpapalakas-loob sa ‘yo,” they said in their audition tape. (The main goal is to inspire the audience. During this time, when you feel that there is little hope, we will give a performance that will empower you.) Dong Pilotos, the group’s manager, also highlighted this love for the country in his interview with Rappler. “Ang gagawin namin (What we’re going to do), especially sa (for the) semi-finals, is to dedicate our performance to the nation.” A common love for hiphop was what brought this Batangas-based group together. However, they wanted to bring something different to the table, and their shadow play performances were born. “Ang common hobby po namin is pagsasayaw po ng hiphop, pero kailangan naming maging unique para makilala kami kasi napakadami pong magagaling na dancers sa Pilipinas,” the group added. (A common hobby of ours is dancing hiphop, but we needed to be unique so we will stand out because there are so many great dancers in the Philippines.) The group previously participated in the now defunct local reality show Pilipinas Got Talent, and their unique dance routines had them finishing in 4th place.   Starting Thursday, April 16, viewers can vote for their favorite act in one of three ways: SMS, Facebook and the Asia’s Got Talent mobile app.  Voting opens after the broadcast of each semi-final episode and will remain open for 4 days.

Hugnatan finished with a conference-best 21 points on 9-of-14 shooting in addition to 6 rebounds to spearhead the Bolts locals, while Davis was back to his high-energy play and registered 32 points to go with 19 rebounds. Gary David continued his impressive play despite being out of action for two weeks in lieu of the league’s All-Star Wekeend, finishing with 14 points that was punctuated by his game-sealing 3-pointer with two minutes remaining in the game. “Gary David got hot in the second half and he helped us pull the game out,” his head coach, Norman Black, said following the contest. “I want to give credit to Reynel Hugnatan who had a big game for us offensively,” Black said about his big man, who scored a career-high 28 points when Meralco faced Barako Bull last conference. “I think one of the main reasons why he played really well today is because we shared the basketball.” The Bolts finished with 19 assists and shot a superb 50% from the field, despite going just 3-of-13 from downtown. Fortunately for Black, two of those triples came at very crucial stretches for his team. Led by by former Ateneo Blue Eagles star Nico Salva, the Energy stormed back from a double-digit second half deficit and was within 7, 84-77, with 4 minutes to go. A hook shot in the paint by Davis extended his team’s edge back up to nine, but free throws and a baseline midrange jumper by Salva, who scored all of his 10 points in the final period, trimmed his club’s deficit down to 5, 86-81, with 3 minutes to go. {source}<iframe src=”https://vine.co/v/O9p0uqinQKF/embed/simple” width=”600″ height=”600″ frameborder=”0″></iframe><script src=”https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js”></script>{/source} A few plays later, an offensive possession for the Bolts went haywire as the Energy’s defense cut off driving lanes and closed out on shooters. This led to Hugnatan having to take an off-balanced right-corner 3-ball, which luckily for his squad, hit nothing but net. After getting a stop on defense, Meralco handed the ball to a curling David who used a screen to get open and sink the dagger of the ballgame. {source}<iframe src=”https://vine.co/v/O9pE7P5gpv9/embed/simple” width=”600″ height=”600″ frameborder=”0″></iframe><script src=”https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js”></script>{/source} “It’s nice to have Josh Davis back a hundred percent,” Black said about his import, who sustained a severe left hip contusion just before the All-Star break in a loss to the San Miguel Beermen. Despite not yet recovering, Davis still opted to play in his team’s next contest – a loss to the NLEX Road Warriors where he fouled out. His teammate Jared Dillinger, who had 4 points on Friday, said that the recent arrival of Davis’ girlfriend has helped made things easier for the Bolts import. “It’s great,” Davis said post-game about having her around. “It inspires me.” “Josh Davis is a pretty good player,” Black said about his rebounding machine. “He’s not a great offensive player… but he brings a lot of energy to the table, he makes us a better defensive team.” Meralco, now 6-2 and tied with the Talk ’N Text Tropang Texters, will look to close out their campaign strong with remaining games against the Alaska Aces, Purefoods Hotshots, and Blackwater Elite. “It just gets more difficult; we get Alaska and Purefoods back to back,” Black said. If the eliminations ends with the Bolts and TNT still tied, the former would get the tiebreaker owing to their head-to-head win. Barako Bull entered Friday’s game at 4-4 and with the fourth seed in the league standings, but now falls to a tie with KIA at the no. nine seed thanks to the loss.

De Lima singled out the National Transformation Council (NTC), a group composed of allies of former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. The group includes Norberto Gonzales, a former defense secretary and national security adviser under the Arroyo administration. In a statement, De Lima slammed the NTC for urging “the installation of a civilian-military junta.” She pointed out that the group wants to become “the de facto government” of the Philippines. She also criticized the NTC for proposing or conspiring “to commit the crime of coup d’etat,” as when it requested the military’s support. “The NTC’s pronouncements and publicly declared strategy for the capture of state power through active military support to the NTC are therefore acts which already constitute conspiracy or proposal to commit rebellion and coup d’ etat (Art. 136 in relation to Arts. 134 and 134-A, Revised Penal Code), conspiracy to commit sedition (Art. 141 in relation to Art. 139, RPC) or, at the very least, inciting to sedition (Art. 142, RPC), as well as illegal assemblies (Art. 146, RPC),” the justice secretary said. She explained: “A junta by any other sanitized name is still illegal and unconstitutional. By calling for people power and military support to force the President’s ‘resignation’ in order to pave the way for a junta, the NTC and its mushrooming allied alphabet soup organizations of discredited government officials consisting of charged plunderers, grafters, and tax evaders, or of those under investigation for such crimes, may have just crossed the line of legitimate dissent.” “The government will not relent in applying the full force of the law against them in order to protect the people and the State from an unconstitutional and illegal power grab,” De Lima said. Reports of a coup plot surfaced as President Benigno Aquino III faces the worst crisis of his presidency: a bloodbath in Mamasapano, Maguindanao, that killed 44 members of the Philippine National Police Special Action Force (PNP-SAF), 18 Muslim rebels, and at least 3 civilians.  ‘Perverting nation’s grief’ On February 16, Senator Antonio Trillanes IV – a former coup plotter himself – earlier identified Gonzales as among the persons trying to oust Aquino.  “Ang papel ni Norberto Gonzales, manggulo sa Pilipinas,” Trillanes said. (The role of Norberto Gonzales is to sow confusion in the Philippines.) Rappler is still trying to reach Gonzales as of posting time.  In her statement on Sunday, De Lima accused the NTC of spreading the word about a supposed coup threat. She said the reported threats “are not coup threats in the strict sense of the word” because they “do not come from any section of the government’s security forces.” She said this is part of the NTC’s “carefully formulated” strategy – “in the false hope of propagating it legally in the mass media and among supporters without however accruing any criminal liability under the penal laws on rebellion, sedition, and coup d’ etat.” “This is a false hope, since certain actions already implemented by the group, from organizing foras and conferences of supporters and sympathizers, can already be contemplated as conspiracies relating to sedition, rebellion or coup d’ etat,” De Lima said. De Lima stressed that “any civilian or religious-led putsch will not succeed” because the military “will never support” a junta led by ex-officials and bishops affiliated with Arroyo.  “It is the height of pathetic gutter politics, when the tragic loss of 44 police officers killed in the line of duty is used by disgraced pathological personalities to crawl their way back to national relevance, at the expense of the people’s effort to come to terms with the complex issue of peace in Mindanao in their search for justice for the SAF 44,” she said. De Lima said, “The nation is still grieving, and without any sense of shame, these personalities would use the people’s grief to pervert a national catharsis, serving only their own thirst and craving for absolute power by imposing upon this nation a tyranny of religious and political has-beens.” The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, for its part, also rejected extra-constitutional measures as bishops linked with the NTC call on Aquino to quit. (READ: Cardinal Vidal not calling for Aquino resignation – secretary) The NTC’s moves came as various groups and individuals, including the President’s uncle, Jose “Peping” Cojuangco, also called on Aquino to quit. A group led by Cojuangco staged an anti-Aquino rally on Sunday at the EDSA Shrine, a monument to remember the People Power Revolution in 1986 that toppled dictator Ferdinand Marcos and catapulted the President’s mother, Corazon, to power. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/80045-oil-plunge-golden-opportunity-asia-countries/","title":"Oil plunge a ‘golden opportunity’ for Asia economies","date":"Jan 7, 2015 3:42 PM PHT","snippet":"Lower oil prices would ease inflationary pressures in the region, allowing many central banks to either keep monetary policy on hold or reduce interest rates","body":"SINGAPORE – The plunge in crude prices will give a much-needed boost to Asia’s oil-guzzling economies and provides governments a “golden opportunity” to implement crucial structural reforms such as cutting expensive energy subsidies, analysts say. A slowdown in the key export markets of Europe, China, and Japan, the end of US stimulus measures, and an expected US rate hike – fuelling a flight of foreign cash in search of better returns – has left some governments having to make tough decisions to get back on track. But experts say lower oil prices would ease inflationary pressures throughout much of Asia, allowing many central banks to either keep monetary policy on hold or reduce interest rates. And the Asian Development Bank (ADB) last month said developing countries could see an additional 0.5 percentage point of growth on average this year if oil prices remain low. However reforms are needed, analysts say, and among the most crucial and controversial is the removal of fuel subsidies, which in the past been the catalysts for sometimes violent protests across the spectrum, from the impoverished to the region’s growing middle class. While global equity markets are being strafed by a continuing slump in the prices of black gold – they have fallen more than 50% since June to 5.5-year lows – analysts said countries should grab the opportunity and move now. Malaysia, Indonesia, and India have already made cut to the populist but economically disastrous subsidies, which have contributed to government fiscal deficits. Shang-Jin Wei, chief economist at the Manila-based ADB, said in a statement that easing oil prices “present a golden opportunity” for oil-importing countries to introduce the reforms. And Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at global consultancy IHS, warned if they fail to move, leaders “will miss the window of opportunity and face public resistance to removal of fuel subsidies if oil prices strengthen significantly in future years.” Angry protests Previous efforts in Indonesia to slash fuel subsidies sparked violent protests, but the country’s new president Joko Widodo has vowed to tackle the problem despite risks to his popularity. Widodo, who took office in October, wants the money diverted to overhauling infrastructure and helping the country’s poorest. An attempt by former Indonesian president Suharto to reduce the subsidies triggered riots that helped end his 3-decade dictatorship in 1998. India also experienced similar protests in the past when it tried to cut the subsidies – diverted government funds used to artificially keep fuel prices low. Removing the payouts allows market forces to determine prices and free them from political manipulation. The softer crude prices will also provide some respite for the region’s oil-reliant economies, facing global headwinds from slowing in their key export markets. Biswas said, “most of the Asian economies are large net importers of oil and gas, and will benefit from lower oil import costs and significantly reduced fuel costs for consumers.” “This positive boost helps to mitigate the negative effects of China’s moderating growth rate and Japan’s slump back into recession in late 2014,” he said. Analysts expect India, Asia’s third largest economy, to be a major beneficiary as it imports nearly 80% of its oil needs. Like China and South Korea, the lower prices should keep inflation in check and allow the central bank to implement much-needed interest rate cuts with less fear of stoking inflation. Among the top winners is the airline sector, while shipping and energy-intensive heavy manufacturing industries such as steel will benefit across the region. Shukor Yusof, founder of Malaysia-based aviation research firm Endau Analytics, said jet fuel accounts for about a third of airline operating costs in Asia. Further losses ahead “You’re likely to see airlines posting profits for the fourth quarter of 2014 and for this coming quarter,” he told AFP. “Given the trend in falling oil prices, we should see a corresponding correction in air fares as well.” (READ: Lower airfares seen as CAB lifts fuel surcharge) However, oil and gas exporters including Malaysia and Brunei stand to take a hit. With petroleum-related earnings accounting for 30%-40% of Malaysian government revenues annually, the ringgit currency has fallen almost 11% against the US dollar over the past 6 months as oil prices sank. Malaysia in October forecast economic growth of 5%-6% for 2015, but the World Bank projects the expansion at 4.7% due in part to lower oil prices. And there could be further falls in the oil price from the present levels of $47.90 for West Texas Intermediate and $50.82 for Brent. Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, told AFP he expects WTI to hit bottom at $46 and Brent to hover at $50-$53 in the second quarter of this year. He forecasts WTI to average $58-$63 a barrel this year, against the average $92.60 in 2014 and $98.05 in 2013. Brent is projected to average $60-$65 this year, compared with $99.29 last year and $108.70 in 2013. But Ang and other oil market watchers say further price falls to below $40 would not surprise them. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/79141-femen-activist-vatican-nativity-released/","title":"Femen activist who grabbed Vatican Nativity Jesus released","date":"Dec 27, 2014 9:04 PM PHT","snippet":"The judicial authorities in the papal micro state opt instead to ban her from the Vatican and Church properties elsewhere","body":"VATICAN CITY – Vatican authorities on Saturday, December 27, ordered the release of a Femen activist detained after snatching a baby Jesus figurine from the St Peter’s Square Nativity scene on Christmas Day while baring her breasts. Ukrainian Iana Azhdanova was arrested and taken into custody on Thursday after she snatched the figurine in one of the feminist group’s trademark topless protests. She had faced possible trial in Vatican City for “disturbing the peace, obscene acts in a public place, and theft.” The judicial authorities in the papal micro state opted instead to ban her from the Vatican and Church properties elsewhere. “The promoter of justice (Vatican attorney) met this morning with the lady Iana Azhdanova,” said Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi. “He endorsed the arrest made by the police on Christmas Day for the crimes which she had contested. He ordered her release, while intimating a ban on entering Vatican City, the Basilica (of St Peter’s) and other extraterritorial places,” Lombardi said, according to Italian news agency ANSA. Lombardi had said on Friday that the Vatican regarded the Femen protest as “extremely serious due to the setting and circumstances that intentionally offend the religious sentiments of a very large number of people.” While Azhdanova was released, Italian businessman Marcello di Finizio, who was arrested Friday for scaling the facade of St Peter’s, remained in detention on Saturday pending interrogation by a magistrate. Di Finizio was protesting over new EU rules governing tenders for beach concessions, which he fears could threaten his business on the northeastern coast. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/79013-topless-femen-activist-vatican/","title":"Topless Femen activist grabs Baby Jesus in St Peter’s Square","date":"Dec 26, 2014 9:54 AM PHT","snippet":"An activist from the feminist group Femen bares her breasts in St Peter's Square on Christmas Day and rushes the Nativity scene, grabbing the Baby Jesus figurine.","body":"VATICAN CITY – An activist from the feminist group Femen bared her breasts in St Peter’s Square on Christmas Day and rushed the Nativity scene, grabbing the Baby Jesus figurine.

Although the incident occurred well after Pope Francis delivered his Christmas message from the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica, thousands of pilgrims were still in the famous square. Femen has staged similar stunts at the Vatican, such as a protest last month over an imminent visit by the pope to the European Parliament. The three Femen members were wearing only leather mini-skirts and flower garlands in their hair, and one had the slogan “Pope is not a politician” emblazoned across her chest. On November 24, the day before the pope’s visit, a topless Femen activist mounted the altar of the Strasbourg cathedral.

Troops moved into Place de la Nation in the capital Ouagadougou and took over the national television headquarters in a show of force, despite calls by the international community and protesters for a return to civilian rule. Threatened with economic sanctions, the military pledged to put in place a transition government formed by “broad consensus”. The army has stepped into the power vacuum left by president Blaise Compaore, who was forced to resign in the wake of violent street demonstrations over his 27-year-rule that some have likened to the Arab Spring. But the military said it was acting only with the interests of the nation at heart and that “power does not interest us”. “What is currently at stake is more than self interest,” it said in a statement issued after Isaac Zida – the man it named as interim chief – met opposition leaders. UN envoy for West Africa Mohamed Ibn Chambas said he had joined African leaders in pressing the country’s military top brass to hand power back to civilians. If the army refuses, “the consequences are pretty clear”, he said. “We want to avoid having to impose sanctions on Burkina Faso.” There were similar calls from the United States and European Union. Hundreds of thousands of protesters, furious at plans to extend Compaore’s rule in the impoverished landlocked country, had massed on the streets of Ouagadougou on Thursday, October 30, some going on a rampage and setting the parliament and other public buildings ablaze. ‘Four presidents in 3 days’ Under Burkina Faso’s constitution, the speaker of parliament was supposed to step in as interim head of state following the president’s resignation. But the army instead named Zida, the second-in-command of the presidential guard, as head of the transitional authority. Zida, 49, beat out an earlier claim to the job by army chief Nabere Honore Traore, winning the military’s endorsement on Saturday, November 1. He said he was appointed to ensure a “smooth democratic transition” and promised to consult with the political opposition and civil leaders. The army reiterated that stance after Zida met opposition leaders, who, along with civil society leaders, had called Sunday’s (November 2) rally in protest at a military takeover. Several thousand people answered the call, carrying banners bearing the slogans: “The soldiers have stolen our revolution”, “Zida get out!” and “Zida is Judas.” Some protesters also headed to the national television headquarters where two opposition leaders made separate attempts to go on air to declare themselves interim chief. Former defense minister Kouame Lougue – whose name was chanted by thousands in the streets following Compaore’s downfall – told Agence France-Presse: “The people have nominated me. I came to answer their call.” But the technicians walked out, interrupting transmission, also foiling a bid by Saran Sereme, a former member of the ruling party, to make her claim as leader of the transition. “Compaore stayed 27 years, but that’s no excuse to have 4 presidents in three days,” said one bemused local in a tweet. One person was killed close to the television headquarters where soldiers fired shots in the air to disperse protesters. The army said the victim was likely struck by a stray bullet. Opposition figures have said around 30 people have been killed in a week of violent protests. Hospital sources told Agence France-Presse that there had been at least 6 deaths, including two by gunshot wounds. Bitter disillusionment Burkina Faso – known as Upper Volta in its era as a French colony before becoming independent in 1960 and changing its name in 1984 – faces its worst crisis since a wave of unrest three years ago. From March to June 2011, a spate of army mutinies swept the country, alongside public protests over high food prices, unemployment and the looting of property by troops. Compaore was only 36 when he seized power in a 1987 coup in which his former friend and one of Africa’s most loved leaders, Thomas Sankara, was ousted and assassinated. Sankara’s widow said this week’s uprising has “rehabilitated” her husband’s memory. “Dear compatriots, you have brought a victory without precedent with this popular insurrection,” she said in a statement to protesters from her home in southern France. Like several sub-Saharan African leaders Compaore clung to power for the following decades and was re-elected president 4 times since 1991. The uprising that finally forced him out was sparked by plans to change the constitution to allow him to stand yet again for elections next year. His legacy is one of grinding poverty for most of the country, which languishes at 181 out of 187 countries on the UN Human Development Index. Compaore and his wife have taken refuge in neighboring Ivory Coast where they are being put up in a luxury government mansion in the capital Yamoussoukr. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/73073-marc-marquez-malaysian-motog-pole-position/","title":"Marc Marquez grabs Malaysian MotoGP pole position","date":"Oct 25, 2014 4:41 PM PHT","snippet":"The Spanish Repsol Honda rider clocked a record lap time of one minute 59.791 seconds in Saturday qualifying at Sepang, 0.182 seconds ahead of his team-mate and compatriot Dani Pedrosa.","body":"SEPANG, Malaysia – Recently crowned world champion Marc Marquez will start on pole position for Sunday’s Malaysian MotoGP, surpassing the record for the most poles in a single season.

GrabTaxi does not have its own taxi fleets, thus its reliance on drivers renting from taxi companies to use their app. “We want to make our drivers happy. Happy drivers make happy passengers,” Paolo Evalle, GrabTaxi driver experience head said during the app’s Davao City launch on Wednesday, October 22. Leading its third round of funding is US-based investment firm Tiger Global, with Hillhouse Capital Management joining current investors GGV, Qunar, and Vertex Ventures. Tiger Global also has investments in Flipkart, an Indian online retailer; Netflix streaming service; and Quora, a community-based Q&A site.    “We now have the firepower to compete with our competitors,” said Natasha Dawn Bautista, GrabTaxi marketing vice president. GrabTaxi’s “to do” list, given its latest fund infusion, include hiring and retaining the right people, particularly  tech whizzes who ensure that GrabTaxi app is running efficiently; improving their “champion driver’s” program; and helping refurbished old cars. A competitor to EasyTaxi and Uber taxi booking apps, GrabTaxi currently has 400,000 active monthly users and makes two bookings every second. Calling themselves the “David” of the competition, Bautista said the firm, which started in 2011 as a for profit social start-up, is sticking to its Southeast Asia expansion, eyeing one to two countries to add to its current 6 markets – Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. “We’re very proud that we’re a Southeast Asian company. We’re local. We have become expert in the Southeast Asian market. We don’t want to lose our focus on this market,” Bautista stressed. Davao City is the 17th location in Southeast Asia to use the app. Davao City is the third city in the country to experience GrabTaxi’s selling proposition of convenient, easy, and safe taxi experience for passengers enduring inefficient transport franchises and price-gouging drivers. The app launched in Cebu in July, following its August 2013 launch in Metro Manila. In May this year, GrabTaxi launched GrabCar in Manila to compete with Uber that has a dedicated fleet of limousine drivers. Davao City has been chosen for its increasing number of smartphone users with data connection, stable taxi franchises (currently GrabTaxi Davao has 11 fleet), and to “help Davao promote itself as a tourist destination.” Driver’s welfare Evalle said GrabTaxi aims to improve the people management (of operators to their drivers), increase operators and drivers income, and improve the branding of fleet operators. John Henry Eugenio, a taxi driver in Davao City for 12 years now, said that since he used GrabTaxi, he saw an improvement in his daily income, booking 4 to 5 passengers from the busy hours of the morning until early rush hours in the afternoon. “Before, we kept driving from Claveria to JP Laurel to pick up passengers. It was a waste of time and gasoline,” Eugenio said in Filipino.  JP Laurel is where the Ateneo De Davao University, University of Mindanao, Artiaga Street Shop, SM Lanang Premier, the Marco Polo Hotel are within reach. Within a 3-kilometer radius, a GrabTaxi driver would bid if they can give you a ride. It’s not a first come, first serve basis though – whoever is the nearest driver is the one to pick you within a minute and drop you off at your destination. To date, more than 300 drivers and passengers have used the app in Davao. Unlike in Manila where the booking fee is P70 ($1.56*) on top of the P40 ($0.89) flag down taxi rate, Bautista said that they are considering a P20 ($0.45) to P30 ($0.67) booking rate in Davao City. But until December 31,  Davaoeños can enjoy a zero booking charge, Bautista said. The same goes for Cebu. “We want the drivers to come to you and not you running after them to get a ride,” Bautista said. On top of improved passenger ridership, Eugenio said his income is seeing an increase of 30%. Bautista said the drivers can experience a 30% to 300% income increase or from P600 ($13.39) to P2,000 ($44.66) to P3,000 ($66.99) a day. This also translates to improved boundary or daily rental fee for taxi operators. Evalle said that GrabTaxi is looking primarily after the welfare of the taxi drivers. To enable them, GrabTaxi is microfinancing an affordable smartphone unit to be used by the drivers to help them locate passengers via FourSquare, GoogleMaps, or Waze. Eugenio said the Cloudfone he is using is worth P10,000 ($223.19), which he is paying for P50 ($1.16) a day for 200 days. He explained in Filipino: “But there are some drivers though who couldn’t pay for their smartphones regularly because they get “short ( earn less than the boundary) and they won’t be able to drive the next day or days.” “GrabTaxi though won’t penalize them for late payment (for the smartphones),” he said. Only the top 2% of the drivers are being rewarded at the moment – monetary reward if they booked 5 more passengers in a day, grocery bags, or a family trip to an amusement park, Evalle said. Health medical organization (HMO) benefits are also eyed to be provided to the top performing drivers.       “Operators can now track who among their drivers are the best and the worst. Davao drivers are very obedient; they abide by the rules. They’re very productive,” Evalle said. Currently, there are 6,000 plus taxi units in Davao City, with the likes of All Aboard, Holiday, and Maligaya, leading the fleet. The Metro Taxi Drivers Association are supporting their drivers to use GrabTaxi while other fleets are availing of the app to augment their communication needs, like lack of radio for the operator to deploy drivers. Eugenio said only 8 out of 50 drivers of All Aboard are using GrabTaxi at the moment, since the fleet has no radio deployed to drivers. “Since I attended two GrabTaxi meetings, I teach some of the drivers also how to use the app,” he added. Improving the system Asked if they are going to enable credit card payment for GrabTaxi, Bautista said they are looking into it, among other payment options, but the market is transacting mostly on cash basis. With regard to erring drivers, Bautista said drivers will not only be sanctioned but “bad” passengers as well. Erring drivers will be suspended or stricken out of the system after 3 violations, while passengers displaying bad behavior are also deleted from the system. “We’re also looking after the driver’s welfare. It’s not always the driver’s fault because there are also some passengers who are at fault,” Bautista said. Loyal “grabbers” or passengers also get reward from GrabTaxi, Bautista added. GrabTaxi is also eyeing a GrabCar launch in Cebu and Davao next year, as the app is still fine tuning details. Eugenio said to make sure he stays data connected, he loads, out of his own pocket, P20 ($0.45) to P30 ($0.67) daily or twice of that amount on a given day. Since GrabTaxi has partnered with Globe Telecoms, Eugenio can call the passengers using Globe or TM if in case he could not find them by using the navigation apps or the directions he was given. “Some passengers don’t give their exact location, they don’t add landmarks. If we’re taking longer to find them, they’d be impatient and we lose them. It would help if they be more specific to say where they are so we can pick them up faster,” Eugenio said.    GrabTaxi officials said they are working on a free call system between drivers and passengers regardless of networks. “I’m happy with GrabTaxi. I hope more Davaoeños will use it,” Eugenio said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/72218-philippines-clear-massive-court-backlog/","title":"Philippines pushes to clear massive court backlog","date":"Oct 16, 2014 7:11 PM PHT","snippet":"Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno says she would hire more trial court judges, resolve cases in days when possible, and press authorities to enforce court rulings","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines is overhauling its notoriously slow judicial system to speed up the resolution of cases from years to mere days, Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno said Thursday, October 16. Sereno said she would hire more trial court judges, hasten legal procedures, and press authorities to enforce court rulings to clear a backlog that burdens judges with as many as 4,000 cases at a time. “We want to say that, in the Philippines, it’s no longer justice delayed and therefore justice denied,” Sereno, 54, told foreign correspondents. “We want people to experience justice in real time, justice on time,” said Sereno, the country’s first female chief justice and youngest to be named to the post. Twenty-seven courts in the capital are pilot-testing a system in which “small” cases such as drug peddling are decided in 4 days, she said.

Sereno said the case, which grabbed international attention and became a symbol of the impunity that critics say powerful figures enjoy in the Philippines, might not be decided before President Benigno Aquino III steps down in mid-2016. “With the way things are going, I don’t think anyone can make this kind of promise,” Sereno said.

Makiling in Laguna, bagged Silver Medal in the Asian Kids Art Competition. He was honored during the Closing Ceremonies of the recently concluded 17th Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea last October 4, 2014.             At 15, Wika Nadera, whose work is entitled Araw ng Palarong Asya, is the youngest non-athlete member of the Philippine delegation. He is one of the finalists with Zhapanov Dinmukhamed of Kazakhstan who placed first and  Noora Khalid Abduwahad Abdulrahman of United Arab Emirates who grabbed the third prize. Ugyen Phunthso of Bhutan and Le Thu Phuong of  Vietnam complete the Top Five spot.             Only 40 National Olympic Committees out of 50 member countries were able to send entries to the first and only Asian Kids Art Competition. The said art contest started in Kazakhstan four years ago. All the artworks were exhibited at the Athletes Service Center within the Athletes’ Village from  21 September to 1 October. “The winners were decided by a voting system where each athlete residing at the Athletes’ Village voting for the best artwork and the most went to Artwork No. 015.” according to Sajani Hamza of India who work for theOlympic Council of Asia’s Culture Committee chaired by Mohammad Al Kamali. The group — whose project manager is Karla Berikovna of Kazakhstan — succeeded in assisting in the development of relevant cultural activities at the Asian Games and in fostering the development of Art and Sports in line with the Olympic Movement.             Asian Kids Art Competiton expects from the young artists of Asia — from 11 to 15 years old — to display their knowledge and personal view on the Asian Games through artworks. It also envisions the promotion of different cultures in Asia and, consequently, the development of intercultural relations among Asian countries. Thus, artworks must display any one of the following themes of the competition: (a) My Asian Games, My Hopes; (b) Sport as a Way of Life; (c) Our Tradition, Our Culture. As a result, the young Asian contestants were able to showcase  the knowledge of the Asian Games thereby showing their devotion towards the Olympic movement in Asia.              In the Philippines, Asian Kids Art Competition began in July of 2014 under the leadership of Mrs. Celia Kiram of  the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) and Dr. Lauro Domingo of the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC). The deadline was set on 11 July and the judging was scheduled on 18 July with the PSC and POC Officials at the PSC Lobby where the artworks were shown to the public. The Board of Judges is headed by famous United States-based artist and art professor John Cinco and is composed by Dr. Leticia Ho, president of the Philippine Center for Gifted Education; Mr. Orlando Abon, president of the Philippine Arts Education Association; Mr. Benjamin Marasigan, Jr., chairperson of the Animation Program of the St Benilde’s School of Design and Arts; and Mr. Jose Dinglasan, award-winning painter and former art director.  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/71282-celebrities-feeling-nuts/","title":"Why are celebrities grabbing their ‘nuts’ on social media?","date":"Oct 13, 2014 8:30 AM PHT","snippet":"Move over #ALSIceBucketChallenge!

Who do you think is most prepared to take on the crown this year?","body":"History was made last year when Megan Young became the first Filipino to win the elusive Miss World crown. For sure, the whole world is already keeping an eye on the delegate the Philippines will be sending in London this December for the 2014 finals. (READ: Full rundown: Miss World Philippines 2014 candidates) Who among this year’s 26 candidates measure up to the standards set by Megan? Here are my predictions: The top contenders Miss World Philippines 2014: Valerie Weigmann (#19) All eyes are on Valerie, who has been touted as “the girl to beat” since Day 1. Much is expected of her since she is already a TV personality and a professional model prior to joining the pageants. Since the pageant started, this 24-year-old Filipino-German has won fans over with her queenly aura. No wonder she won the Miss World Camsur special title during the pre-pageant activity held in the province. Among the candidates, she is the most ready to conquer the Miss World stage. She’s got a toned figure ready for the Beach Beauty segment. Her experience in professional modeling will surely work to her advantage in the Top Model competition. She previously pulled off some magic tricks that may have impressed the judges of Miss World’s talent portion. Though not that sporty, Val has been regularly going to the gym, which could help her endure the strenuous Sports competition. Most importantly, she has an interesting advocacy. She is actively involved in Musikaramay, which aims to raise funds to provide livelihood and healthcare for the Aetas of Tarlac through music. All these plus her stunning face and calm aura, Val is undoubtedly the best girl to wear the Philippines sash in Miss World this year. 1st princess: Rachel Louise Peters (#7) Rachel was one of the standouts during the press presentation and also managed to wow the judges during the Miss World Camsur mini-pageant. Winning the Best in Swimsuit and Miss Photogenic awards in that pre-pageant activity cemented her status as a frontrunner in the competition.  What Rachel needs to focus on is to make her catwalk feel more natural. Despite that, her universal beauty, good communication skills and impressive academic background are enough to bring her closer to the crown. 2nd princess: Lorraine Kendrickson (#1) A sight to behold during the press presentation, Lorraine appeared on stage with a big smile. She introduced herself well and her catwalk commanded attention. This 19-year-old print and ramp model is already polished, though at times she appears too rehearsed. Nevertheless, she remains a strong contender for the title.  3rd princess: Christine Balaguer (#12) Based on her credentials alone, 24-year-old Christine could already pass as a Miss World candidate. She is into swimming and is a dragon boat team member. She is an experienced print and ramp model despite her hearing impairment. Her advocacy on becoming a role model for deaf people like her would make a good Beauty with a Purpose campaign. Overall, she is a strong candidate. She just needs to work on finding that perfect look for the finals to make her presence overall feel fresher.  4th princess: Gazini Christiana Ganados (#5) Unlike the other front-runners, Gazini has yet to find her defining moment in the competition. But it can’t be denied that this 19-year-old Cebuana is an appealing candidate. She is effortless when it comes to the swimsuit category – no wonder she made it to the Top 10 of Miss Bikini Philippines 2014. She still needs more training to polish her pageant skills, but that stunning beauty deserves no less than a Top 5 finish.   Who else might take it all? 6. Ina Dominica Guerrero (#16) It’s not hard for her to get noticed because of her exotic looks. But aside from that, 21-year-old Ina grabs attention because of how well she moves onstage. She has been among the most consistent since the screenings, and has improved since her Miss Philippines Earth stint two years ago. 7. Nelda Ibe (#20) Nelda, 21, was among the standouts in the presentation show but despite that, she remains underrated. But if her gala fashion show performance is any indication, this former Mutya ng Pilipinas candidate could pull off a surprise come finals night. She flawlessly worked that blue dress, despite being beside two heavy favorites. She should keep that good styling, too.  8. Alexa Rae Kirby (#3) At 18, Alexa is no longer new to pageants. Back in the US, she joined Miss Teen Pennsylvania USA and Miss Teen Philippines before winning Miss Philippines Quest-USA 2014, which earned her an automatic slot in this year’s MWP roster. She already has the goods, however, her performance during the press presentation was a little subdued. 9. Eliza Johanna Cruz (#25) Eliza, 20, isn’t just banking on her famous celebrity surname (she’s the sister of Geneva Cruz) for a shot at the crown. In fact, she went through training at one of the pageant camps. This girl is into marathons, and she looks great in photos – but when it comes to her in motion, we want more. She needs to add more fire to her performance to keep up with the rest.  10. Kristine Angeli Estoque (#6) Kristine, 21, is a diamond in the rough. Her greatest asset is her morena beauty, which is perfectly complemented by her long, straight, gorgeous hair.  11. Nicole Donesa (#14) After her luckless stint in Bb Pilipinas 2012, 20-year-old Nicole is back for another shot at being a beauty queen. Her personality is more relatable now, thanks to her showbiz background. However, her presentation skills remain her waterloo. 12. Jean Marie Feliciano (#21) Jean Marie is very engaging to watch onstage with her toned body and good catwalk skills. No wonder she won Best in Swimsuit in the inaugural Miss Grand Philippines pageant held last August. But despite being among the tallest, she just blends in when beside the rest of the girls. She just needs to find that perfect look for the finals to stand out.  Almost there: 13. Ranielah Marie Oval (#9) Ranielah, 22, may not be a clear favorite, but she certainly has pageant experience. She placed as a runner-up in pageants in Palawan and has competed in Miss Casino Filipino and Miss Bikini Philippines. Her adorable personality could be her ticket to the semifinals.  14. Ruffa Nava (#18) Tagged by Cosmopolitan Magazine as one of the sexiest models in the country, 21-year-old Ruffa is undeniably gorgeous especially when she hits the runway. However, her styling during the press presentation and gala night were disappointing. She needs to find the right hairstyle to complement her beauty. Just a suggestion: ditch the curls and go for a bun or do the wet look a la Miss Universe 2006 Zuleyka Rivera. 15. Priscilla Kimberley dela Cruz (#4) With this 24-year-old Filipino-American-Latina’s pageant experience (she competed but went home empty-handed in Mutya ng Pilipinas and Miss Bikini Philippines 2012), it won’t be surprising to see her make the cut. She has beautiful radiant skin – and that smile could catch anyone’s attention. Who’s your pick for Miss World Philippines 2014?

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has gone from being behind the scenes tending to the task of managing website addresses to being center stage in a play for power on the Internet. “Governments want to exert control over the sweeping trans-national power of the Internet that is effecting their policies, politics, social fabric and/or their economic conditions,” ICANN chief executive Fadi Chehade told the Agence France-Presse just days before the group gathers in Los Angeles beginning Sunday to tackle an array of hot issues. “The other groups are large corporations concerned about security issues,” he continued while discussing forces striving for influence over the organization. “Therefore, they are stepping in with force to figure out how to reduce potential harm to customers and to their businesses.” Governance of the Internet will be a high-profile topic at the ICANN 51 meeting that will continue through October 16 in Los Angeles. The World Economic Forum recently unveiled a project aimed at connecting governments, businesses, academia, technicians and civil society worldwide to brainstorm the best ways to govern the Internet. WEF launched its NETmundial Initiative in a bid to build on the outcome of a large conference in Brazil in April that called for a transparent, multi-stakeholder approach to running the Web. “Anyone who wants to come in and build a coalition of stakeholders and address issues, more power to them,” Chehade said of the crowd-sourcing move. “The way we put it in ICANN is getting the free will of the people to bottom-up coalesce, work together and come up with solutions.” Participants at the conference in Brazil balked at a push by some countries, including China and Russia, for governments to move into a leading role in overseeing the Internet, amid fears of the impact this could have on the unity of the Web and on online dissent and freedom of expression. Chehade told AFP that the WEF will be involved in a more action-oriented initiative to be announced shortly. “We don’t need more dialogue, we need more solutions,” Chehade said. Solutions ‘not forthcoming’ The ICANN 51 agenda that includes tackling whether identities of those running websites should be public or whether privacy should be safeguarded and operators true names revealed only with proper court orders. ICANN runs a Whois.icann.org service where contact information can be found regarding registered operators of specific websites but not necessarily people behind business names. “It was designed by engineers as a technical tool to contact servers,” Chehade said of Whois. “Now, it is becoming a directory of a billion websites; it was not designed for that.” ICANN has mapped a path to evolve Whois into a true global website directory, complete with privacy safeguards for website operators, according to the chief executive. Chehade felt that ICANN has a good grip on the technical challenges it faces but “we have some holes” in non-technical issues such as privacy, cyber security, intellectual property rights, taxation and more. “All these non-technical issues that occur in the space of the use of the Internet, rather than the system that runs the Internet, require global frameworks of cooperation to address,” Chehade said. “In general, these solutions are not yet forthcoming.” Pushed too far ICANN is also being pushed beyond its scope, being asked to tackle cyber security and bad behavior by website operators. Essentially, issues beyond protecting and managing the “root” of the domain name system are outside ICANN’s claimed territory. “It is happening, and we are resisting it,” Chehade said. He compared the situation to a customer being treated horribly by a car service opting to take their complaint to the department of motor vehicles that issued the driver a license. What makes it frustrating turning away people with legitimate complaints about websites is there tends to be no where to send them for help, he noted. “As we move forward, ICANN and others may have roles in an eco-system of cooperation that may involve multiple parties to address bad behavior,” Chehade said. Critics of ICANN have included France, which branded the US-based body unfit for Internet governance. The eurozone’s second-largest economy has been at war with the body, which assigns domain names like ‘.com’ and runs crucial internet infrastructure, over the ‘.wine’ and ‘.vin’ suffixes being rolled out as part of an unprecedented expansion of domains. – Rappler.com Global network with network socket image from Shutterstock"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/71421-in-photos-ravena-tolentino-rosario-awards/","title":"IN PHOTOS: Ravena, Tolentino, Rosario grab top UAAP awards","date":"Oct 8, 2014 5:21 PM PHT","snippet":"Kiefer Ravena overcame an injury plagued season last year to win Season 77's MVP award","body":""},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/71263-cambodia-land-grab-victims-seek-icc-probe/","title":"Cambodia land grab victims seek ICC probe","date":"Oct 7, 2014 10:03 AM PHT","snippet":"Victims of land grabs by Cambodia's 'ruling elite' call for the International Criminal Court to probe their mass evictions as a crime against humanity","body":"THE HAGUE, Netherlands – Victims of land grabs by Cambodia’s “ruling elite” called on Tuesday, Otober 7, for the International Criminal Court to probe their mass evictions as a crime against humanity. Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians have been affected as part of a “widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population, pursuant to state policy,” said a complaint to be filed at The Hague-based ICC. “The ruling elite have illegally seized and re-allocated millions of hectares of valuable land from poor Cambodians for exploitation or speculation by its members and foreign investors,” said the complaint to be filed on behalf of victims by lawyer Richard Rogers on Tuesday. Aid groups estimate that 770,000 people, or six percent of Cambodia’s population, have been evicted since 2000, including 20,000 people in the first three months of 2014. At least 4,000,000 hectares (10 million acres) of land have been confiscated, which represents 22 percent of Cambodia’s land area, often for lucrative rubber or sugar plantations. “Anyone who resists is being shot, raped, wrongfully prosecuted,” Rogers told Agence France-Presse. “The violations of human rights are massive.” “All this for the tiny elite ruling over the country to get richer and to retain power.” Land grab victims are either sent to resettlement camps or left with nowhere to go, he said. ‘Worse than Pol Pot’ While Western countries have tried to condition aid on human rights, increasingly China is “giving money without asking questions,” Rogers said. The “ruling elite” has quelled resistance with attacks on civil society leaders, monks, journalists, lawyers, environmental activists and protesters, the complaint said, allegedly including over 300 politically motivated murders since the 1990s. “There is a reasonable basis to believe that members of the ruling elite have committed, aided and abetted, ordered and/or incited the crimes of forcible transfer, murder, illegal imprisonment, other inhumane acts.” Anyone can file a complaint with the office of ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, and she must decide whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant an official investigation. Cambodia has ratified the court’s Rome Statue, meaning the ICC has jurisdiction over the most serious crimes committed there since 2002. “Entire villages have been burned to the ground and possessions stolen or destroyed” by the police, the army and private security firms supported by “the state apparatus,” the complaint said. “Dissidents have been brutally murdered by professional assassins or condemned to linger in jail on spurious charges.” One eviction to make way for a development in Phnom Penh in January 2009 saw police armed with guns, electric and steel batons, wooden sticks, tear gas and water canon forcibly remove 400 families. “When I saw the eviction it really was worse than Pol Pot,” said an unnamed social worker and eviction victim, referring to the late leader of the murderous Khmer Rouge regime. “During the Khmer Rouge people were evacuated from Phnom Penh, but they did not destroy the houses and give all the land to an individual.” Land titles are a murky issue in Cambodia where private ownership was abolished during the 1975-1979 rule of the communist Khmer Rouge and many legal documents were lost. It is up to the ICC prosecutor to decide which individuals to prosecute, the complaint said, adding that Cambodia’s justice system was not prosecuting any of the allegations, leaving it up to the ICC to intervene. The threat of a probe may encourage the Cambodian government to change its policies or pursue the alleged crimes in domestic courts, which would head off an ICC investigation. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/71121-watch-pacquiao-pba-debut/","title":"WATCH: Pacquiao scores 1 point, grabs a rebound in PBA debut","date":"Oct 5, 2014 5:35 PM PHT","snippet":"Pacquiao had mixed results in his PBA debut, splitting free throws in Kia's preseason loss to Blackwater","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Manny Pacquiao may not want to quit his day job. The Pacman received a strong reaction in his Philippine Basketball Association debut even if he didn’t produce a stat line for the ages. Pacquiao, wearing jersey number 17 for the expansion team Kia Sorentos, scored 1 point, grabbed one rebound and turned the ball over twice in ten minutes during his team’s 88-77 preseason loss to the Blackwater Elite on Saturday, October 4 in Binan, Laguna, Philippines. The eight-division boxing champion Pacquiao, who is also the team’s coach, a sitting congressman in the Sarangani province in addition to a multitude of roles in the entertainment industry, checked into the game early in the second quarter and grabbed a rebound shortly after.  He brought the ball down court but quickly had his dribble interrupted and passed off. Later in the quarter another attempt to create offense off the dribble resulted in a turnover as he had his pocket picked by Blackwater’s Chris Timberlake. Pacquiao would miss a transition three pointer before being fouled on an ensuing possession. He missed the first free throw but hit the second. The ball would be in Pacquiao’s hands on the next time down the court when the shot clock hit 24, after which Pacquiao checked himself out. Pacquiao, who at 35 is the oldest rookie in PBA history, is currently in training for the first defense of his newly reacquired WBO welterweight title against unbeaten New Yorker Chris Algieri on November 23 in Macau. Pacquiao’s trainer Freddie Roach, who argued successfully to get Pacquiao’s training camp to take place in his hometown of General Santos City rather than in the distractions of Manila, is set to arrive this week to begin hard training. Pacquiao says he has already spoken with Roach about his PBA venture and says he will only play “maybe just two to three minutes” per game while in training.  “My focus is on my training for the November fight,” he told AFP. Pacquiao’s boxing promoter Bob Arum had previous told Rappler that Pacquiao wouldn’t be playing during training. “He’s not going to get injured and he’s not going to fool around with it during the time he’s going to train for his fight and so forth,” he said.

Bantamweight Ham Sang-Myeong gave South Korea another gold but from then on it was one-way traffic with Kazakhs winning six of the final seven weight divisions. Suleimenov began the gold rush by winning the flyweight title on a split decision against Shakhobidin Zoirov of Uzbekistan, who was unlucky not to get the nod from judges in a close-fought battle. Welterweight world champion Yeleussinov utterly outclassed Israil Madrimov of Uzbekistan on points in the welterweight final. He was followed into the ring by Alimkhanuly who completely demolished Odai Riyad Adel Alhindawi.

Their light heavyweight hope Kim Hyeong-Kyu was involved in the fight of the day against Olympic silver medallist Niyazymbetov. Niyazymbetov was well on top early on but, as he did in his semi-final, Kim slowly clawed his way back by showing huge powers of endurance. The bout ended in explosive fashion with the pair slugging it out furiously toe-to-toe for the final minute, both seemingly on the verge of a knockdown. As the Kazakh was announced the winner by split decision, Kim sunk to his knees in tears of disbelief. “My opponent is a very famous fighter so I have to accept I only got silver,” said Kim. Earlier Shin dominated Kazakhstan’s Birzhan Zhakypov in an energetic display which earned him the title of “Best Boxer of the Tournament.” The award surprised many seeing as he had beaten Mark Anthony Barriga in a semi-final Thursday which most observers believed the Filipino had won. Shin danced around the ring draped in the Korean flag after his verdict was announced. “I thought I would cry if I won the gold medal. But now, I just can’t think of anything and I can’t cry,” Shin said. Mongolia claimed their first ever Asian Games boxing gold when lightweight Otgondalai Dorjnyambuu beat Filipino Charly Suarez on a split decision after a fight that had genuinely been too close to call. Suarez started tentatively and lost the first round.

And Mongolia lodged an official protest after male bantamweight Tugstsogt Nyambayr, who staged a brief sit-in protest, contentiously lost a decision against Ham Sang-Myeong. India’s Devi dominated her fight and when Park’s hand was raised for the win, it sparked jeers and a confrontation which prompted the arrival of police. “I don’t accept this decision. It’s wrong,” a distraught Devi, told AFP, while her husband Chongtham Thoiba Singh confronted officials screaming: “You’ve killed boxing!” He grabbed his wife’s arm and tried to lead her in protest back to the ring, where the next bout was already under way, resulting in scuffles as their path was blocked by security. “Don’t tell me it’s OK! This is not OK! What the hell is going on here!” Singh shouted at the top of his voice. “She won this fight and you give it to Korea,” he yelled. Police were called into the arena and stood in a cordon between the press area and the ring. The India team’s Cuban coach Blas Iglesias Fernandez called for the judges to be sacked. “I hope all these judges that made this decision are thrown out of the tournament,” he said. “It was a totally clear bout, not any doubt. Only those people saw the South Korean as the winner. She won every round. She hammered her.” (RELATED: PH boxers Suarez, Lopez defeat Iraqis to advance at Asiad) Meanwhile the Mongolian team said they had lodged an official protest with the International Boxing Association (AIBA) over Nyambayr’s defeat. “Depending on AIBA’s response, one of the actions being considered is withdrawing the entire boxing team from the Games,” press attache Naran Baatar told AFP. No one from AIBA was immediately available for comment and an official from the Games’ organizing committee also refused to comment when approached by AFP. The episode took the gloss off what should have been a glorious day for India in the women’s semi-finals. In the first bout of the day, icon and five-times world champion Mary Kom outpointed Vietnam’s Le Thi Bang to erase bitter memories of falling in the last four in both the last Asian Games and Olympic Games. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/70532-september-29-2014-binay-poe-sotto-pulse-asia-survey-2016-makati-parking-building-hongkong-protests/","title":"Rappler Newscast | September 29, 2014","date":"Sep 29, 2014 9:43 PM PHT","snippet":"Vice President Binay’s lead drops in polls. Toilet fixtures in Makati building way above market prices. Protests in Hong Kong disrupt travel and business","body":"  Today on Rappler. VP BINAY’S LEAD IN PRESIDENTIAL POLL DROPSVice President Jejomar Binay continues to top the latest Pulse Asia survey on the May 2016 presidential elections, but his lead in the September survey drops by 10 percentage points.31% of survey respondents say they will vote for Binay, down from 41% in June.This comes in the middle of corruption allegations against the Vice President over an allegedly overpriced government building in Makati where he used to be mayor.Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, who is leading the Senate probe on the Binays, also saw a decline in support in the survey.From 5% in June, he’s down to 1% in September.Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, the administration’s presumptive bet for 2016, is a far second with 13% of voters saying they will vote for him. This is 6 points higher than his 7% in the June survey.The other winner is Senator Miriam Santiago, who gained 5 points from 7% in June to 11% in September. PULSE ASIA POLLS: POE FOR VP, SOTTO NUMBER 1 SENATORMore on the polls: Neophyte Senator Grace Poe tops Pulse Asia’s vice presidential survey.Poe leads the September survey, with 31% of respondents saying they will vote for her.It’s 5 percentage points higher than her 26% in the June survey.A far second from Poe is close ally Senator Francis Escudero with 19%.For the senatorial slate, comedian-turned-politician Senator Tito Sotto tops the polls, with 51.6% of voters saying they will vote for him.Not too far behind is former senator Kiko Pangilinan at 51.5%. With a 3-point error margin, Sotto and Pangilinan are statistically tied in the top spot. ‘WORLD-CLASS’ PRICES FOR BINAY’S PARKING BUILDINGA Rappler exclusive: The toilet fixtures in the controversial Makati parking building that sparked corruption allegations against Vice President Binay cost far more than current retail prices.Based on estimates by contractor Hilmarc’s Construction, toilet bowls can go up to P32,000; male urinals, from P12,000 to P31,000; wash basins, up to P25,000; and hand dryers, as much as P62,000.Most of the fixtures are from American Standard, a mid-range manufacturer whose retail prices are at least 3 to 4 times less than Hilmarc’s cost estimates.In two years, the difference in prices of those same toilet accessories rose by around 300% per unit.Labor costs to install these items were also jacked up.Phases 3, 4, and 5 of the building construction were carried out in 2010, 2011, and 2012. But changes in the specifications for the building requirements resulted in higher contract prices for all 3 phases.Phase 3 of the building’s construction has a contract price of almost P600 million; Phase 4, almost P650 million, and Phase 5, P143.8 million.The entire building cost P2.8 billion.Apart from the jump in cost per unit, Hilmarc’s Construction also appears to have padded its labor costs for installing the toilet fixtures by 30%. Hilmarc’s supposedly won the bidding for Phase 1 and was the sole bidder for the 4 remaining phases. Vice President Binay oversaw Phases 1 and 2 when he was mayor of the city, while his son implemented Phases 3 to 5.Current Makati Mayor Junjun Binay calls it a “world class building.”But Senate resource persons who inspected the building said it was average, and not “world-class.” RH LAW FULL IMPLEMENTATION BY NOVEMBER 30The health department says the controversial Reproductive Health or RH law can be fully implemented by November 30.Once the Food and Drugs Authority or FDA certifies the contraceptives to be distributed are safe and will not induce abortion, a “full rollout” can be expected.The RH bill was signed into law in 2012, after a 14-year struggle led by advocates and lawmakers. The controversial law faced opposition from religious groups, but the Supreme Court declared the law constitutional in April 2014.The RH law requires government health centers to provide free contraceptives and mandates schools to teach sex education.It also legalizes post-abortion medical care, but not abortion itself. TROOPS DEPLOY AFTER ABU SAYYAF THREATEN GERMAN HOSTAGESAbout 1,000 soldiers of the Philippine army flew to Sulu Sunday, where militants from the Abu Sayyaf group are believed to be holding two German tourists. The group earlier threatened to execute one of the hostages.Reports say the tourists are an elderly man and a woman. Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin says the Philippines would not negotiate with the Abu Sayyaf over its $5.62 million ransom demand.The Abu Sayyaf also demanded Berlin stop its support for the US-led campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS. The Abu Sayyaf is a group of Islamic militants originally organized with Al-Qaeda funding in the 1990s. The group has been blamed for the Philippines’ worst terrorist attacks. JAPAN VOLCANO RESCUE SUSPENDED AS DEATH TOLL HITS 36About 36 hikers are feared dead after they were found near the peak of Japanese volcano Ontake Sunday.Mount Ontake erupted without warning Saturday, spewing ash, rocks and steam. Around 230 hikers were able to make it to safety soon after the eruption, but rescue workers found the rest in “cardiac arrest” near the summit. Rescue operations are suspended Monday because of the growing danger from toxic gas.Mount Ontake’s last significant eruption was in 1979.Apart from Ontake, volcanoes Mayon in the Philippines and Sinabung in Indonesia threaten to erupt.Japan, Philippines, and Indonesia are all within the Ring of Fire, a region in the Pacific vulnerable to seismic and volcanic activity. PROTESTS DISRUPT HONG KONG TRAVEL AND BUSINESSES Riot police in Hong Kong pull back Monday after thousands of pro-democracy protesters caused travel chaos and widespread disruption in the city.In a statement, authorities urge protesters to “give up occupied roads as soon as possible” in a bid to restore public transport services.Crowds of defiant demonstrators took control of at least three major thoroughfares, paralyzing parts of the city after hours of overnight battles with police firing tear gas.This comes after a week of student-led boycotts against China’s decision to allow only candidates chosen by Beijing to stand in the city’s elections for chief executive in 2017.

Iran have won FIBA Asia three times since 2007, once each in Japan (2007), China (2009) and the Philippines (2013). Mohammad ‘Samad’ Nikkhah Bahrami believes it is time for FIBA Asia to look away from the traditional powers in the east of the continent when deciding the 2017 edition. “FIBA should give the Asian championships to us for sure,” Nikkhah Bahrami, whose side beat seven-time Games champions China to reach Wednesday’s semi-final against Kazakhstan, told AFP. “If you see all the important games, they always give it to China. Olympic qualification is in China. World Cup qualification is in China. The not so important tournaments they give to Korea, Japan, the Philippines,” he added. “We can do it. We have a very good team. Since 2007 we have won a lot of Asian championships. We have the facilities.” The next Asia Championship, held every two years, is to be hosted by China next year. The tournament will double up as an Olympic qualifier, with the winners automatically gaining a place in the 2016 Rio Games. The 2017 Asia Championship is still up for grabs and the winners of that event will qualify for the 2019 World Cup. Iran suffers from international sanctions over its nuclear program. While there is no direct link to sports, the country’s isolation in the international monetary system could make it difficult for any federation to stage a major championship in Iran, experts said. Any Iranian bid would face opposition from other powers such as Saudi Arabia. Nikkhah Bahrami believes that Iranian fans should be given the chance to support their heroes at home however. “We are winning a lot of championships and people see it on TV. I don’t know why we never get to host some international games because a lot of Iranian people would come out to support, they love their basketball. “FIBA Asia don’t give any important games to Iran. And if you see all of the championships we won, they were all outside our country. Our people want to see it inside.” He said that basketball was growing rapidly in Iran on the back of the national team’s success. Tough schedule “Football is of course the number one sport in Iran. All countries in the world they love soccer. But basketball is challenging volleyball now as number two. There are courts everywhere.” Nikkhah Bahrami also revealed that he was considering retiring from the national team because his schedule is so demanding. The 31-year-old plays for Fujian in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and Tehran’s Mahram club once the Chinese season ends. “I don’t know even if next year I will be playing (for Iran). Maybe I’ll retire from the national team because it’s hard,” Nikkah Bahrami said. “I haven’t decided yet, but every year there’s pressure. I need rest, it’s tough. We play all season (in China), then we go to Iran and play there.” The 2014-15 CBA season starts in early November and runs until February and the Iranian Superleague season runs until the end of playoffs in May. “Then after the club season we have a lot of international friendlies, then this year there was the World Cup (in Spain last month) and the Asian Games straight after where you’re playing eight, nine days in a row,” he added. “When we leave Incheon we will start with the (Chinese) league 10 days later. The league is who pays us, so we have to be ready for that. Always.” – Rappler.com Related stories"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/70148-gilas-iran-asian-games/","title":"Gilas Pilipinas falls to mighty Iran in Asian Games","date":"Sep 25, 2014 3:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Gilas led by as many as 7 in the fourth before Iran streaked to win their fourth straight over the Philippines in this nonbearing Asian Games match","body":" MANILA, Philippines (2nd Update) – Gilas Pilipinas once again fell to regional giants Iran as they succumbed, 68-63, in Group E of the 2014 Asian Games on Thursday, September 25 in Incheon, South Korea.  The 2013 FIBA Asia champions Iran continue to be the bane for the Philippine national men’s basketball team, winning their fourth straight meeting dating back to the 2012 FIBA Asia Cup in Tokyo.  Gilas trailed 29-17 after Iran opened with a hot-shooting first quarter but limited Iran to just 7 points in the second to trail 36-34 at the half. Gilas held a 7-point lead in the fourth quarter but was outscored 18-10 en route to the defeat.  The Philippines finished the qualifying round at 1-1 and settled for a second seed heading into the quarterfinals, while Iran remains unbeaten after wins over the Philippines and India.  Gilas moves to Group H for the quarterfinals together with Kazakhstan. Depending on match results, Gilas could be on a collision course with longtime rivals South Korea should the hosts win their game against Jordan today. The final slot for Group H will go to the winner of the Qatar versus Japan contest. Quarterfinals are single round robin and the top two teams from Groups G and H will make up the semis cast where it will be crossover knockout matches. Gilas blew a 60-53 lead early in the payoff period as Iran closed the match on a 15-3 run.  A three-pointer from guard Mehdi Kamrani (12 points) gave the Iranians the lead, 60-61, with 4:08 on the clock.  Gabe Norwood pushed Gilas ahead for the last time, 63-61, on a pair of free throws with just over two minutes to go. But Iran’s Nikkhah Bahrami tied the count at 63 and later scored 3 of his 4 free throws to give Iran some cushion, 66-63, with 22.3 ticks remaining. After allowing Iran to shoot 67% in the opening quarter and zoom past them, 19-6, the Philippines came alive on the defensive end, clogging the paint and forcing Iran to the outside. Gilas packed some steam come the second frame, limiting Iran to just 7 markers for 10 minutes to stay within striking distance. The nationals’ momentum did not waver in the second half as they grabbed their first lead of the game, 39-36, on a three-pointer and a fastbreak basket by Paul Lee. A Marcus Douthit jumper gave Gilas its biggest lead of the ballgame at 7 points, 51-44, at the 2:41 mark of the third.  Douthit, who was unable to see action against Iran at last year’s FIBA Asia due to an injury, scored 8 points for Gilas in the first 20 minutes. He sat out most of the fourth period, however, due to foul trouble. He finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds. Chot Reyes’ wards, coming off an inspired FIBA World Cup stint, sputtered towards the end despite shooting 35% from three-point land and 88% from the stripe. Iran outrebounded Gilas, 45-35.  Lee topscored for Gilas with 11 markers while LA Tenorio and Norwood added 10 and 9 points, respectively. Big man Hamed Haddadi and Bahrami led the charge for Iran. The NBA veteran Haddadi registered 18 points and 15 rebounds, while Bahrami wound up with 23 markers. – Rappler.com Related Stories:"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/69979-ceres-pachanga-ufl-fa-league/","title":"Ceres, Pachanga grab wins in UFL FA League","date":"Sep 24, 2014 2:26 AM PHT","snippet":"Ceres-La Salle FC and Pachanga-Diliman FC thwarted their foes to snatch wins in the group stage of the United Football League FA League Cup","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Ceres-La Salle FC and Pachanga-Diliman FC thwarted their foes to snatch wins in the group stage of the United Football League (UFL) FA League Cup at the Rizal Memorial Football Stadium on Tuesday, September 23. Capitalizing on their momentum coming off an imposing first game win, Ceres FC dominated Stallion FC, 4-2, to tally their second win in the FA League Cup. The battle between the two Visayan clubs started off with Stallion FC exhibiting their strength by asserting their way through the heart of their rival’s defense, resulting in an early goal by Jordan Mintah in the 11th minute. Not long after, UFL rookie Adrian Gallardo answered back with a goal of his own off a pass from Orman Okunaiya in the 14th minute to level the score line at 1-1. A flurry of attacks coming from both sides marred the remaining minutes of the opening half but no more goals were sunk going into the break. Azkals standout Patrick Reichelt, who came in as a substitute in the 34th minute, extended the lead for Ceres as he notched one through the middle of the Stallion FC defense in the 50th minute. With just a single goal separating them from their opponents, Stallion FC continued on with their game, pressuring Ceres on both sides of the pitch but their toothless attacks were easy pickings for veteran goalkeeper Ed Sacapaño. Reichelt headed another goal into the back of the net off a corner kick in the 57th minute to extend the lead of his squad to 3-1. Consequently, Stallion retaliated on the other side via a free kick goal by Angel Carrascosa in the 61st minute. The game progressed with Ceres only leading Stallion by a goal, 3-2.  In the dying minutes of the game, veteran defender and Ceres FC skipper Juani Guirado wrote the final sentence of the match as he slipped a final goal in to end the game, 4-2. Meanwhile, Pachanga FC captured their first win in the tournament by overshadowing Manila Jeepney FC, 4-3. The action-packed game escalated quickly as back-to-back goals were slithered by both clubs five minutes into the first half courtesy of Pachanga’s Behrouz Khoshgavar and Manila Jeepney’s Arthur Kouassi. A few minutes after, Kouassi, in an effort to break the deadlock, broke free from his defender and struck a scissor’s kick towards the Pachanga goal but the crossbar denied his shot.  In the 22nd minute of the match, Gerardo Valmayor managed to find a gap on Manila Jeepney’s defense via a pass from his teammate Jafary Dastjerdi and finally break the 1-1 standstill between the two teams. Pachanga-Diliman was relentless with their offensive blitz forcing the defense of Manila Jeepney FC to give up a penalty kick due to a handball inside the box. Yi Young Park took the penalty and converted, giving his club a 3-1 advantage going into halftime. Preventing their adversaries from capturing an easy win, Manila Jeepney shifted their offense to full throttle which then led to another goal by Kouassi in the 53rd minute. The recharged offense of the Manila-based club proved to be instrumental as they managed to pull off a comeback via a penalty kick that was sank by Jahanbakhsh Zabihi Taher to tie the game at 3-3. Answering back on the other end, Valmayor logged his second goal to extinguish the fired up offense of Manila Jeepney and end the game with a 4-3 score line for his home squad.

Parantac barely squeaked past Myanmar’s Chan Ko Ko Nyein, who took the bronze medal after registering a score of 9.65.  Parantac settled for 8th place in the men’s taijijian or double-edged sword event with his score of 9.58.

Gone from Incheon will be protective head gear after the Amateur International Boxing Association shook up the rules last year. Gone also will be displaying the score at the end of each round to prevent boxers who have built up a lead from coasting home. And almost certainly gone appear to be China’s hopes of more than one or two medals despite being the leading nation in Guangzhou with five titles – including all three in the inaugural women’s competition while India had five finalists, taking two golds. Kazakhstan swept up seven men’s titles out of 10 at last year’s Asian championships, and four of those winners will be aiming to add Asian Games golds. Kazakhstan have the favorites for both the men’s heavyweight (91kg) and super heavyweight titles (+91kg) in Anton Pinchuk and Ivan Dychko. Dychko, in particular, looks on an unstoppable march towards gold, having taken the silver in Guangzhou four years ago. Since then he tucked away an Olympic bronze medal in 2012 and last year both a world championships silver and an Asian championships gold. Welterweight world and Asian champion Daniyar Yeleussinov is also a hot selection to defend his Asian Games title from four years ago. And Kazakhstani compatriot Adilbek Niyazymbetov is ranked number one in the world at light heavyweight having won silver in the 2012 Olympics and last year’s world and Asian championships. China look very lightweight by comparison with none of their five gold medalists from Guangzhou returning, including the outstanding flyweight Zou Shiming who turned professional after winning a second Olympic gold in London and is lining up a world title tilt next year. By contrast their inexperienced 2014 squad appears to contain only two likely medal candidates. Flyweight Chang Yong took silver four years ago in Guangzhou, while bantamweight Zhang Jiawei was second in last year’s Asian championships. Queen Mary India, too, look to be hard pushed to repeat their success of four years ago, especially as they will be without superstar and pin-up Vijender Singh who strolled to the middleweight title in Guangzhou. Part-time model and actor Singh, whose bronze at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing caused boxing to take off in India, injured his hand on the way to Commonwealth games silver in Glasgow in July and withdrew last month. It leaves India’s other Guangzhou gold medalist Vikas Krishan, who won the lightweight (60kg) title in 2010, to carry the country’s hopes. But he may find the big step up to middleweight (75kg) a difficult hurdle to overcome. India’s boxing queen Mary Kom, who has inspired a Bollywood movie on her life, is looking to reproduce the form that won her an incredible five world titles in the 48kg category between 2002 and 2010. She takes to the ring at flyweight (51kg) after only managing a disappointing bronze four years ago when a heavy favorite in the same weight class. India’s other medal hopes rest with reigning Asian bantamweight champion Shiva Thapa and 2010 Commonwealth Games light welterweight champion Manoj Kumar. Hosts South Korea have big hopes that lightweight (60kg) San Soon-Chul keep the some gold at home, having lost out 19-9 in the 2012 Olympic final to the legendary amateur Vasyl Lomachenko. Ukraine’s Lomachenko turned professional after the London Games with an astonishing amateur record of 396 wins and one defeat and went on to win the World Boxing Organization featherweight title in June, in just his third professional fight.  The Philippines are always looking for the next Manny Pacquiao and their sponsors are reported to have dangled the team a three million peso ($67,000) reward for finding one and bringing back a gold.

Though praising anything about the North is against the law, people in the South admired the troupe of sharply dressed, good-looking “Army of Beauties” first brought to the South when the Asian Games were held in Busan in 2002. But organizers of the Incheon Games hope that a 204-member South Korean beauty squad who will carry gold, silver and bronze prizes for more than 400 medal presentation ceremonies will grab the spotlight instead. The “Medal Ceremony Girls” are all first-year students at Inha Technical College in Incheon, training to become flight attendants. Competition for admission is fierce with only one in every 100 applicants accepted. For the presentations, the squad members wear a dress based on a traditional hanbok gown, and their tied-back hair is topped with a Korean-style tiara as worn by the country’s former royalty. The shoes are conservative but still have attitude with three inch heels. The girls, with an average height of 5-foot-5 are proud of their features. But they have endured eight weeks of tough training for the Asian Games. They practiced walking with books on their heads or between their knees while carrying water bottles on trays for a balanced posture. ‘We are better looking’ “Training was tough and hard to endure, but I could not give up because I wanted to compete with North Korean cheerleaders here in Incheon and attract attention from spectators,” Park Seong-Yun, a medal ceremony girl at the weightlifting contest, told AFP. “I don’t want to compare my team with the North Korean cheerleaders, who were selected from many beautiful girls, but I think we are better looking,” she said. North Korea’s “Army of Beauties” have taken part in three international sporting events in the South, and proved a major ticket draw each time. The aura surrounding the troupe has increased since one veteran, Ri Sol-Ju, became the wife of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. Park, 20, said her colleagues have trained hard to put on a flawless show of elegance when they deliver the medals. “This is one of the most crucial affairs in my life, and I know my mission is very important,” said Park. Park appeared nervous before walking into the weightlifting arena Sunday night when North Korea’s record-breaking weightlifter Kim Un-Guk was awarded a gold medal in the men’s 62kg. It was Park’s first encounter with a North Korean, but she achieved her mission in front of a packed audience, including a dozen North Korean officials and athletes waving their national flags from the stands. “I’m sure they are a delight to watch,” said Lee Young-Hee, a professor of aircraft cabin service management at Inha, who helped train the South Korean squad. “My students were well qualified because of image-building classwork. After eight weeks of special training, they became perfect as medal ceremony girls,” she said. The professor was confident that her students would showcase the beauty of South Korean women. “Compared to North Korean cheerleaders, my girls have poise and a polite attitude and are better in every aspect,” she said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/69659-china-gold-asian-games-shooting/","title":"China wins first gold of 2014 Asian Games","date":"Sep 20, 2014 12:40 PM PHT","snippet":"China won the first gold medal of the 2014 Asian Games when its women shooters clinched the 10m air pistol team title.","body":"INCHEON, South Korea – China won the first gold medal of the 2014 Asian Games on Saturday, September 20 when its women shooters – Olympic champion Guo Wenjun, Zhang Mengyuan and Zhou Qingyuan – clinched the 10m air pistol team title. Hosts and defending champions South Korea, who were the pre-Games favorites, finished a poor fourth behind silver-medallists Taiwan and Mongolia. Medal winners are decided by combining the qualification scores of each team member, a rule that ruined South Korea’s chances. The home team’s Kim Jang-Mi and newly-crowned world champion Jung Jee-Hae took the first two positions in the qualifying round, but team-mate Oh Mink-Yung came in 28th. The Chinese shot consistently with Guo, who won the 10m individual title at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, finishing third, Zhang seventh and Zhou eighth. Mengyuan wasn’t done yet grabbing medals as she beat Korean favorite Jung Jee-Hae to win gold in the individual event. Shweta Chaudhry of India picked up the individual bronze ahead of China’s Zhou Qingyuan and reigning Olympic champion Guo Wenjun. China’s legendary coach Wang Yifu said the pressure of performing at home may have got to the Korean girls. “We could not take victory for granted because Korea is very strong in this event,” Wang told Chinese reporters. “But I am happy our girls did well. “The Koreans were let down by one shooter. That happens in this sport. That is why we have to make sure we perform consistently.” Jung said she felt a “little bit shameful” after losing out on the gold following her success in Spain. “I am very excited at getting a medal, but also a little bit shameful for not winning gold,” she said. “But I will do my best next time. “Actually all the attention after winning the world championships made me a bit uncomfortable. I just wanted to enjoy the Asian Games. This experience will do me a lot of good.” Hosts South Korea struck gold later on in the morning when Lee Ha-Sung won the men’s changquan in the wushu competition. Poor ticket sales and public apathy had caused concern in the build-up to the 45-nation, 9,500-athlete tournament. South Korean organizers are counting on home athletes winning medals to fill seats. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/68296-september-5-2014-nlex-traffic-juan-ponce-enrile-hospital-arrest-dinosaur-argentina/","title":"Rappler Newscast | September 5, 2014","date":"Sep 5, 2014 8:54 PM PHT","snippet":"Friday traffic gets worse than usual in the North Luzon Expressway.

Ally Washington, the United Nations and Egypt all called for an urgent rethink after Sunday’s (August 31) announcement, which angered the Palestinians and alarmed Israeli peace campaigners, and comes days after a long-term ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians took hold. According to the Israeli military, the land move was a political decision made after the June killing of three Israeli teenagers snatched in the same area, known to Israelis as the Gush Etzion settlement bloc. “This announcement, like every other settlement announcement Israel makes, planning step they approve, and construction tender they issue, is counterproductive to Israel’s stated goal of a negotiated two-state solution with the Palestinians,” a US State Department official said. “We urge the government of Israel to reverse this decision.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policy of settlement expansion on land the Palestinians claim for a future state is deemed illegal by the European Union and an “obstacle to peace” by the United States. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was “alarmed” by Israel’s plans, his spokesman said. “The seizure of such a large swathe of land risks paving the way for further settlement activity, which – as the United Nations has reiterated on many occasions – is illegal under international law and runs totally counter to the pursuit of a two-state solution,” the spokesman said. “The secretary-general calls on Israel to heed the calls of the international community to refrain from settlement activity and abide by its commitments under international law…” Egypt – which last week mediated a permanent truce between Israel and the Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip to end a 50-day war – denounced Israel’s move. “This is not a positive step – it contradicts international law and will have negative consequences on the peace process,” a foreign ministry statement in Cairo said. The foreign ministry did not mention the Gaza truce talks, but insisted that Israel’s planned West Bank land grab would be “an obstacle” to a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Rights watchdog Amnesty International similarly denounced the Israeli plans, saying that it “appears to be the largest land grab in the occupied Palestinian territories since 1980.” “Israel’s strategy of illegally confiscating land for settlements in the West Bank must stop once and for all,” said Amnesty’s Philip Luther. The Palestinians have called for diplomatic action against Israel, while Israeli peace campaigners said the land expropriation is the biggest of its kind in three decades. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/economy/67493-henry-sy-50-richest-philippines-2014-forbes/","title":"Forbes: Henry Sy still Philippines’ richest","date":"Aug 28, 2014 11:45 AM PHT","snippet":"The collective wealth of the 50 richest people in the Philippines reached $74 billion in 2014, up 12% from $65.8 billion in 2013","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Mall magnate Henry Sy remains to be the wealthiest Filipino, according to Forbes magazine’s The Philippines 50 Richest List for 2014. With a net worth of US$12.7 billion, the 89-year-old Sy held the top spot for the 7th straight year. His worth increased by $700 million from last year, thanks largely to the rising share prices of his mall and banking businesses. Following Sy was tobacco tycoon Lucio Tan, who also retained his place. Tan, 80, has a net worth of $6.1 billion. Port and casino tycoon Enrique Razon Jr., 54, climbed one place, making him the third richest, with a net worth of $5.2 billion. The collective wealth of the 50 richest people in the Philippines reached $74 billion in 2014, up 12% from $65.8 billion in 2013. Forbes said this year’s list reflected two driving forces in the Philippine economy: construction and consumption. Riding on these were former senator Manuel Villar of mall developer Starmalls and DMCI Holdings’ David Consunji. Villar’s net worth reached $1.46 billion, making him the 14th richest man in the country, while Consunji grabbed the 6th spot, with a net worth of $3.9 billion. New names made it to the list, among them: Ricardo Po of Century Pacific group, Dean Lao of D&L Industries, the Concepcion family of RFM Corporation, and pawnshop titan P.J. Lhuillier of Cebuana Lhuillier. The minimum amount required to be included in the list was $170 million, up from $105 million in 2013. See how the country’s richest grew – or lost some of – their wealth (in million US dollars) in 2014, and how they fared since 2006: Sy and family own the country’s largest largest mall operator, SM Prime Holdings, and bank, Banco de Oro. Tan consolidated his assets into LT Group, including beer maker Asia Brewery and his stake in tobacco manufacturer Philip Morris Fortune Tobacco. Tan is raising funds to buy back the stake of the San Miguel group in legacy carrier Philippine Airlines. Razon owns port operator International Container Terminal Services and Bloomberry, which operates the Solaire Resort & Casino in Manila. Bloomberry is expanding Solaire, adding 300 rooms, a mall and a theater. Tan, 62, is behind Alliance Global, which owns property giant Megaworld, and brandy maker Emperador Distillers. Alliance Global also holds the local franchise of fast food McDonald’s and owns Resorts World Manila. Gokongwei, 87, controls conglomerate JG Summit, which owns budget carrier Cebu Pacific, food and beverage manufacturer Universal Robina Corporation, and mall and property developer Robinsons. Consunji, 92, is behind DMCI Holdings, a construction giant that now gets most of its income from power generation, water and real estate. Ty, 81, is the man behind GT Capital, which controls Metrobank, one of the country’s largest universal banks. GT Capital also has interests in other industries like power, infrastructure and real estate. The company is also engaged in car production through its stake in Toyota Motor Philippines. The family controls Aboitiz Equity Ventures, whose core businesses include power (Aboitiz Power), banking (Union Bank), and food (Pilmico Foods). The family’s fortune was earlier split and listed separately under patriarch Enrique and his nephew Jon Ramon. The Zobels own the country’s oldest conglomerate, Ayala Corporation. Ayala has interests in banking (BPI), real estate (Ayala Land), telecommunications (Globe Telecom), and water distribution (Manila Water). The conglomerate is joining hands with the group of Manuel Pangilinan for rail projects the Philippine government is bidding out. The wealth of the 61-year-old Tan Caktiong comes from his popular fast food business Jollibee, which has the largest chain in the country. Coyiuto, 61, gets bulk of his wealth from his stake in National Grid, which operates the country’s transmission network. He also owns a luxury car dealership, and chairs one of the Philippines’ largest insurance companies, Prudential Guarantee & Assurance. This husband-and-wife team owns booming hypermarket chain Puregold. Puregold is the second-largest retail chain in the country, next to Sy family’s SM. Yap of Philtrust Bank died last year. He was 88. His family vows not to break up the empire he created. A long-time senator before stepping down in 2013, Villar owns mall developer Starmalls, and property firm Vista Land & Lifescapes. His wife, Cynthia, won a Senate seat in the last elections. The siblings – cousins of Jaime Zobel de Ayala – inherited their stake in Ayala Corporation from their wealthy aunt. Yao, 70, founded juicemaker Zest-O, and has a stake in Philippine Business Bank. 86-year-old Gotianun founded and chairs holding firm Filinvest Development, which is engaged in real estate, banking, sugar, hospitality and power. She is president of Mercury Drug, a decades-long industry leader with over 500 drugstores nationwide. Her father, Mariano Que, sold pharmacy items out of a pushcart before opening his first store in 1945. Cojuangco, 79, became a billionaire as his widely San Miguel Corporation grew. His fortune fell below 10-digit mark after selling stake in the diversified conglomerate. He, however, still sits as chairman. She is the widow of Jose Campos of giant local drugmaker Unilab.

EX-BINAY AIDE: VP, NANCY EARNED FROM BUILDING, CAKES  Former Makati Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado drops the bomb on his former ally, Vice President Jejomar Binay.Testifying at a Senate hearing Tuesday, Mercado says he and Binay “benefitted” from the building. Q: Kayo ba ay kumita sa transaksyong ito? (Did you earn from this transaction?) ERNESTO MERCADO FORMER MAKATI VICE-MAYOR: Alam po ninyo po di ako sinungaling. Ako ho ay magsasabi ng totoo dahil pagtatawanan po ako ng taong bayan at ninyong lahat. Noong nagtanong pa lang kayo may tumawa na. Ako aaminin ko sa phase 1 at phase 2, nakinabang po ako. Kung ang vice mayor nakinabang, aba’y siguro higit na nakinabang ang mayor dito. Kasi ako po hindi pumipirma ng kontrata. Tinatanong nyo din lang naman ako nang tapatan.. kung ako ho ay nakinabang, imposibleng ‘di nakinabang ang mayor. (I am not a liar. People will laugh at me. Actually, when you asked the question, people already laughed. In phase 1 and 2 of the building, yes, I earned from that. If the vice mayor benefitted from it, then perhaps the mayor benefitted even more here. It’s impossible that the mayor did not benefit from it. I don’t sign contracts. And frankly, if I got kickbacks, it’s impossible for the mayor to not get his own kickback.) Q: Vice Mayor Mercado, ano yan, based on your personal knowledge, or implikasyon lang yan dahil sa nakinabang ka, pakiramdam mo nakinabang yung mas mataas sa iyo? (Vice Mayor Mercado, is this based on your personal knowledge or are you implying that since you got kickbacks you feel your superior did so as well.) ERNESTO MERCADO FORMER MAKATI VICE-MAYOR:Iyon naman po ang kalakaran eh. (That’s how things work.) Mercado refuses to say how much he or Binay earned.He says he will only give details in court.Mercado was a longtime ally of the Vice President since 1986, but had a falling out in 2010 when the elder Binay broke a promise to support him as mayor of Makati.The Vice President backed his son, now Makati Mayor Junjun Binay.Mercado claims he did not want to run for mayor, but Binay got to him through his father. ERNESTO MERCADO, FORMER MAKATI VICE-MAYOR: Kaya lang naman niya ako nakumbinsi, pinuntahan nya ang aking ama na noon malapit nang mamatay, sabi niya sa tatay ko – “Tatay, kumbinsihin mo naman po itong kaibigan ko na pagbigyan akong magmayor siya.” Noong makaalis po si VP sabi ng tatay ko napakaswerte mo. E di ako naman ho sumubo ako bagamat ako po ay may takot baka maging biktima ako ng pangako. Pero sabi ng tatay ko napakaswerte ko kaya pumayag ako. ([Binay] managed to convince me when he visited my father on his deathbed. He told my father “Tatay, please convince my friend to run for mayor.” When he left my father said I was lucky. I gave in, but I had fears that I might be holding to an empty promise. But my father said I was lucky, so I decided to run.) Mercado also implicated Binay’s eldest daughter, Senator Nancy Binay, who owned a pastry business which supplied City Hall with cakes for senior citizens. Mercado alleges the cakes supplied by Nancy were overpriced. Q: Let me clarify: when you say that Senator Nancy is in charge, what do you mean – binabantayan niya? Is she oversight, or negosyo niya ba yun? (Let me clarify: when you say that Senator Nancy is in charge, what do you mean – she supervises them? Is it her business?) ERNESTO MERCADO, FORMER MAKATI VICE-MAYOR: Alam ko po negosyo niya talaga yun, although wala po talaga ako – hindi na po ako naghanap ng dokumento dahil magkakasama naman po kami noon. Alam ko talaga negosyo niya yun actually kinukwestiyon ko nga ho yon, sabi ko pati ba naman yang cake, anliit na bagay nyan, pwede naman magnegosyo ng iba. (I know it’s her business, although I never asked for any papers because we were all working together. I know it’s her business and I’ve been questioning it because it’s such a small business, she can venture into other businesses.) Senator Nancy Binay denies the allegation.She adds, the cake issue shows she is“the next family member on their demolition list.”The week before, Binay’s political rival Renato Bondal claimed the cakes cost P1,000 or almost $23 each. The Makati City government dismissed the claim, saying it only cost P306 or $7 each.Bondal later said the P1,000-price tag was just a “guess.” TEARY-EYED ABIGAIL BINAY FAILS TO ‘CONFRONT’ CAYETANO More on the Binays…Makati Representative Abby Binay shows up at the Senate on Tuesday vowing to confront Senator Alan Peter Cayetano.Cayetano alleges she was behind the graft case filed against the senator and his wife, Taguig Mayor Lani Cayetano. Senator Cayetano says the complainant, Rod Vera, was Binay’s law school classmate.He also alleges that Abby Binay’s “Thursday group,” associates who visit her house every Thursday, are the ones behind the case. The congresswoman denies having a hand in the case. ABBY BINAY, MAKATI REPRESENTATIVE: Ang tawag ko kay Mayora Lani, kapatid. Ganoon kami kalapit kaya masakit ang ginagawa nila sa akin. (I call Mayor Lani “sister.” That’s how close we are, and that’s why I’m hurt with what they’re doing.) Binay fails to confront Cayetano who was not in the Senate.Cayetano later says he’s not avoiding Binay but had an “appointment outside.”He says the Binays know how to get in touch with the Cayetanos in private and to “let their father answer.” 3 IMPEACH RAPS VS AQUINO DECLARED ‘SUFFICIENT IN FORM’ After much debate, the House committee on justice votes all 3 impeachment complaints against President Benigno Aquino sufficient in form.Lawmakers voted 53-1-1 and 42-7-4 on two complaints.No objections were raised against the third one.The first complaint against Aquino involves Malacanang’s controversial spending scheme.Parts of the scheme were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.The third complaint involves the defense deal between the Philippines and the United States.The complainants accuse Aquino of violating the Constitution, graft and corruption, and betrayal of public trust.The next round of deliberations will be on Tuesday, September 2.

That result sealed the QF pairings, with China facing Kazakhstan, Batang Gilas battling Taiwan, Iran playing Malaysia, and Korea squaring off against Japan.KAZAKHSTAN over HONG KONG, 84-51Box scoresThe Hong Kongers hung tough with the Kazakhs for the entire first quarter before the latter opened things up in the second period and proceeded in cruise control till the end. The taller Central Asians dominated the interior, outrebounding Hong Kong, 53-28, and outscoring them in the paint, 54-20. Valentin Kirilin and Ruslan Aitkali each dropped 21 points to lead coach Alexey Yeropkin’s squad to the final eight, where they will face China. Hong Kong, meanwhile, was paced by Ho Man Chu and Ka Chung On, who tallied 15 and 12 markers respectively.JAPAN over KUWAIT, 86-55Box scoresThe Kuwaitis were as pesky as ever, staying within striking distance till midway through the fourth quarter, where Japan clamped down on defense and extended a 12-point bubble to the final 31-point spread. Kuwait already had 55 points by the 5-minute mark of the payoff period, but they never scored again. Once again, the pairing of Naser Al-Yahyouh and Hamad Hasan was the bright spot for Kuwait, totaling 26 points and 21 rebounds in the loss. On the other end, the victors were paced by Ryosuke Motomura and Yuki Mikami, who scored 19 and 17 respectively. Team Hayabusa nailed a dozen triples in this game, with Motomura and Mikami accounting for nine three-point conversions. Team captain Ryogo Sumino finally saw action again for Japan after missing a couple of games with a knee injury, scoring a baker’s dozen in just 15 minutes of play. IRAN over TAIWAN, 74-41Box scoresJust a day after struggling against Japan, Iran spanked erstwhile unbeaten Taiwan and solidified its dominance in Group F with a 6-0 sweep. Team Melli outscored its foes, 56-31, after the first canto to turn a competitive battle into a bona fide rout. Not surprisingly, Iran dominated the interior again, outrebounding Taiwan, 48-29, and outscoring them around the basket, 42-14. Abdolsamad Soroodi and Ali Allahverdi each scored 14 points to pace the winners, while Mohammad Yousofvand recorded an 11-point, 14-rebound double-double in under twelve minutes of play. Serbian mentor Milos Pejic will now prepare his squad to take on Malaysia in the knockout round. Coach Yang I-Feng, meanwhile, goes back to the drawing board as he now faces the prospect of playing the Philippines, which beat his team a few weeks ago in a couple of tune-up games. Athletic wingman Tseng Po-Yu was the only Taiwanese to score in double-digits with 16 points.CHINA over KOREA, 81-54Box scoresAfter a slow start and drawing with the Koreans at the end of the first twenty minutes, coach Fan Bin’s wards turned on the jets and broke the game open in the second round en route to a sweep of Group E. NBA hopeful Zhou Qi played sparingly in the first half but dominated in the last two periods, leading China with 16 points, 9 rebounds, 7 blocks, and 3 assists. He shot 6/7 from the field and 4/5 from the line in a scintillating effort. Together with Wang Zhelin, Zhou is seen as the future of China’s senior men’s team. He was backstopped by Zou Yuchen and Zhao Rui, who tallied 18 and 13 markers respectively. Korea, meanwhile, saw its guns fall silent in the second half. They finish second in Group E and face dangerous Japan in the QFs. Byeon Jun-Hyeong and Jeon Hyun-Woo paced the losing side with a combined 24 points.QATAR over JORDAN, 66-48Box scoresHosts Qatar salvaged some pride last night after overcoming Jordan and recording its first win in Group E. Qatar started strongly in the second half and never looked back, flashing the form that they missed in their close loss to the Philippines in their previous game. Abdulrahman Saad, once again, was sterling for the home side with a game-high 28 points, 8 rebounds, and 3 steals, while Mohamed Abed tallied 10 points and 7 boards in support. Big man Abdelrahman Abdelhaleem also impressed by grabbing 19 rebounds. The 6’6 center played the game without relief. As for Jordan, Ibrahim Hamati and Mitri Bousheh dropped 12 and 11 points respectively in defeat.PHILIPPINES over MALAYSIA, 72-69Box scoresIn a battle of SEABA squads, Malaysia looked like the better team for the most part, but they couldn’t close it out and were on the receiving end of a late-game flurry from coach Jamike Jarin’s wards. Kobe Paras went on a personal 5-0 spurt inside the game’s final minutes to spark some life for Batang Gilas, while Andrei Caracut sealed the come-from-behind triumph, sinking the go-ahead three-pointer with 24 seconds left. Malaysia’s Joon Lock Wee still had a chance to turn the tables after an unsportsmanlike foul was called on the Philippines, but he missed two free throws and two successive attempts from beyond the arc in the dying seconds. It was a game that was tighter-than-expected as the Philippines beat this same Malaysian team a few months ago in the SEABA qualifier, 93-76. One key player from that game, however, was absent here – Thirdy Ravena – who is currently playing in Manila’s top collegiate tournament. Still, coach Jarin had more than enough firepower to escape the upset axe. Radge Tongco rifled in three treys on his way to 22 points, while 6’6 Kobe Paras contributed a dozen markers. Davu Yu also stepped up with a key three-point conversion in the fourth period, while Mark Dyke tallied 10 points and 10 rebounds in the win. On the other end, Yi Hou Wong and John Wong both stole the show with a combined 27 markers, while top gun Joon Lock Wee added 10 points. Wee, however, made just 3 of his 10 FG attempts. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/66948-china-undefeated-batang-gilas-falls-fiba-asia-u18/","title":"China remains undefeated, Batang Gilas falls in FIBA Asia U18","date":"Aug 22, 2014 12:49 PM PHT","snippet":"China dominates India, 100-40, to keep it's unblemished record while the Philippines drops its second game in the tourney","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines fell big time to a taller and speedier Korean side on Day 3 of the 2014 FIBA Asia U18 Championships. In other developments, China, Iran, and Taiwan also continued undefeated.KOREA over PHILIPPINES, 87-69Box scoresRadge Tongco continued to be Batang Gilas’s top offensive option, scoring 24 points on the strength of 5 triples, but Korea just had more weapons. With superior size and athleticism, coach Kim Seung-Hwan’s crew frustrated the Filipinos at every turn and eventually opened things up in the fourth quarter. Twin towers Kim Kyung-Won and Song Kyo-Chang (both 6’7) paired up for 34 points and 23 rebounds to underscore Korea’s inside edge. Kim also blocked 7 shots to pad his stat-line, Jeon Hyun-Woo and Byeon Jun-Hyeong hit crucial treys to keep the Pinoys at bay the entire game. Korea tops Group B with a 2-0 record even as the Philippine team falls to 1-1.CHINA over INDIA, 100-40Box scoresAs expected, the Chinese ran roughshod over the Indians to close out play in Group A. China, moving up undefeated to the second round, was led by Zhou Qi and Zou Yuchen, who tallied 21 and 19 points respectively. Three other Chinese also broke the double-digit barrier as Wang Zhengbo, Zhao Rui, and Zuo Zhennian each dropped at least 10 markers. Zhao Rui was the best all-around player, grabbing 8 boards, handing out 11 assists, and getting 3 steals. As for India, Gurvinder Gill and Narender Singh each scored 13 points in a losing effort. China sweeps the group and is heavily favored in the second round as India drops out of the race. TAIWAN over JAPAN, 84-75Box scoresTaiwan leaned on a strong third quarter to open things up and keep the Japanese at bay for its third win in as many games. The two Tsengs – Tseng Po-Yu and Tseng Pin-Fu – paced the victors with 20 and 17 points respectively and a combined 18 rebounds. Taiwan’s defense was sterling, forcing 17 Japanese turnovers. Lin Ming-Yi, Taiwan’s diminutive playmaker, was the bulwark of the winners’ defense, netting 5 swipes on top of his 16 points, 7 assists, and 5 rebounds. 6’7 Taiga Watanabe tried to carry the fight for Team Hayabusa with 16 points and 12 rebounds, while Akito Uchida and Yuki Mikami paired up to drill 7 threes in Japan’s losing cause. Taiwan earns a 3-0 slate in group play while the Japanese settle for a 2-1 card heading to the second round.HONG KONG over IRAQ, 94-86Box scoresThe Iraqis were favored in this one and, for the most part, they held sway. Things turned sour, however, when Hong Kong found its mark in the final frame and outscored Iraq, 31-18. Coach Kai Mo Ng leaned on the hot shooting of Yee Fu Ho and Ka Chung On to power his team’s counterattack in the fourth quarter. That duo combined for 8 of Hong Kong’s 9 treys and a total of 55 points. 6’3 center Wai Hang Yip also did well, tossing in 21 points along with 4 rebounds, 4 assists and 4 steals as the victors overcame a huge 25-52 rebounding disparity. Iraq just wasn’t able to close out  after leading by as many as 18 points in the first half. Jassam Al-Saadi paced the Iraqis with 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 3 steals, but he did commit 8 turnovers, the same number also committed by point guard Mohammad Al-Fahham. This result effectively boots Iraq out of contention and keeps Hong Kong’s hopes alive.MALAYSIA over QATAR, 78-70Box scoresIt was a great time for Malaysia to notch its first win in the tournament as its improbable triumph over Qatar propelled the SEABA side to the next round of competitions while giving India the boot. Though Qatar jumped out to an early 10-point lead in the first canto, Malaysia persisted and took the lead in the second half. Coach Yong Kian Ann’s wards utilized better outside shooting (33% from beyond the arc) to frustrate Qatar, which made just 1 three-pointer out of 13 attempts. Wee Joon Lock led the way for Malaysia with 5 triples, scoring a total of 28 points. He was effectively backstopped by Ting Chun Hong, who registered 10 points, 9 boards, and 3 steals. Over on the hosts’ side, Abdulrahman Saad and Mohammad Al-Shawaqfeh scored 28 and 14 points respectively. Malaysia moves on to Group E with a 1-1 slate, while Qatar carries a 0-2 record.IRAN over KAZAKHSTAN, 81-56Box scoresThe Kazakhs gave Iran a bit of a scare in the first quarter before the latter broke the game open in the second period and beyond. As expected, Mohammad Yousofvand recorded an impressive line – 22 points, 11 rebounds, 3 steals, and 1 block – to lead Team Melli, which now advances to the second round undefeated in two matches. Navid Rezaeifar also did well, contributing 19 points, 4 boards, 4 dimes, and 2 swipes. Only one player scored in double-figures for the losing team – Alexandr Danilchenko, who managed to tally 11 markers on 4/4 FG shooting, mostly in garbage time.

The match remained tight down to the very last 10-ball match, and if not for a few mistakes by the never-say-die Filipinos, could have gone the other way. In reality, however, China played better pool, was more focused, and walked out of the Tongzhou Luhe High School arena a worthy champion. For China, the win marks a milestone in Chinese billiard history, as it represents its biggest ever world title in American pool (China twice won the scotch doubles World Cup of Pool).  Forty years ago pool was still considered a decadent bourgeois pastime here, but since China has opened up to the outside world, tens of millions of people from all walks of life have taken to the game. The government, which enthusiastically backs all Olympic sports of which pool is one – has promoted and financed the professional game, developed talent and funded some of the biggest tournaments in the world. Today in Beijing that investment  paid off handsomely. The win by the China 2 squad, which featured Liu Haitao, Dang Ching Hu, Wang Can, Fu Xiaofang, and Liu Shasha also meant a bit of revenge for China, as the Philippines had decimated the China 1 squad in the semi-finals on Friday, 4-0.  Because they had played so well in the semis, and indeed all week, the result was a bitter disappointment for the Philippines. The team, comprised of greats Dennis Orcollo, Lee Vann Corteza, Carlo Biado and Rubilen Amit, outlasted defending champions Taiwan in a classic thriller in the quarterfinals. And their semis performance against the China 1 squad was downright breathtaking.  But in the final, the Pinoys let too many mistakes creep into their game. And the Chinese, who were remarkably focused and calm despite the pressure of playing at home, punished them each and every time. The tone of the day was set right from the start with the two 8-ball matches being played simultaneously. On the TV table Orcollo faced off with Chinese veteran Liu Haitao. Orcollo, who is a former world 8-ball champion, was certainly the favorite in this match, but after the Filipino grabbed the first rack, Liu won the next two and never lost the lead the rest of the way. Orcollo committed two errors that cost him the match, while Liu played focused, smart pool and crossed the finish line first, winning 6-4. At the same time on the adjoining table, Biado and Corteza took on the youngsters of the Chinese squad, Dang and Wang, in 8-ball doubles. Again, the Filipinos took the opening rack but it was all down hill from there as several errors along the way proved costly. The Chinese pair won handily 6-2 and China was up 2-0 in the match and looked well on their way to grabbing the title. With the two 9-ball singles matches up next, the Philippines were suddenly in a must win situation. Corteza and Dang stayed even for six frames, but then the Chinese pounced on two glaring errors by the Filipino to move up 6-3. From there Corteza seemed mentally flat, while Dang played fired up. Dang missed a straight in 9-ball to win it at 7-4, but redeemed himself in the next frame with a break and run to put China up 3-0 and one away from victory. For the Philippines that put the load upon the small shoulders of Rubilen Amit, who was playing 9-ball on the TV table against Fu Xiaofang. All week in Beijing, the smallish Amit had been a total rock for the Philippine team, coming through time and again and giving the squad that insurance all teams require. And against Fu, Amit didn’t disappoint as she played brilliantly again, shooting out to a 5-1 lead. Fu countered with a few racks of her own, but Amit stayed calm and won 8-4 to keep the Philippine hopes very much alive. With the score 3-1 and the two 10-ball matches up next, the Philippines could only hope to make it to a shootout to decide the champion. Still, two short races to 10-ball was extremely doable and nobody on Team Philippines had yet to get down on themselves. The intrigue and tension started to build in the arena as both matches were played simultaneously and stayed tight early.  A few rolls of the balls either way meant we’d either have an outright champion, or the two teams would be headed for a dramatic shootout to decide the world champion. Orcollo’s race to 7 match against the 20 year old Wang was even after six racks, but then the Filipino stamped his class on the proceedings to go up 6-3 and move one away from a win. Then, however, up 6-4, Orcollo missed an easy 10-ball to win the match. At about the same time on the other table, the pair of Liu Haitao and Liu Shasha held a 5-3 lead over Amit and Biado in 10-ball doubles, race to 7. The Pinoys were starting to apply heat when Amit also scratched on a very difficult 10-ball.  Orcollo eventually went on to win 7-5, but his miss on the 10-ball 20 minutes earlier proved pivotal. Had he made that winning 10-ball, the score of the match would have been 3-2, and with Biado and Amit on the comeback, the Chinese pair would’ve felt serious heat straight away instead of several frames later. Still, the pressure was clearly on Haitao and Shasha. They played well to push the score to 6-3 but again, the Pinoys bounced back with two to trail 6-5.  The Chinese then executed a perfect break shot, and calmly ran the colors. Haitao left Shasah a cut on the 10-ball, which the diminutive champion potted with class to claim the title for the home team. After the awarding ceremony, the veteran Liu Haitao seemed to be center of attention of the media and for good reason. The 31-year-old from Inner Mongolia had held the team together with his rock solid form over the last six days, especially in the semis and finals, when it counted most. Liu noted that despite the pressure on the team to win at home, they came into today’s match with a positive attitude that served them well all day. “We were relaxed out there today,” Liu said through an interpreter. “We didn’t really look at it as a final. The Philippines is always so strong so there’s no use in worrying and before the match I told the team to just take it easy, have fun and try not to think too much. Just enjoy ourselves.” A disappointed Orcollo spoke for his gutted teammates, rightly pointing out that at this level, mistakes are always very costly. “We weren’t that strong today,” Orcollo said. “We made too many mistakes, got some bad rolls. The 8-ball matches were bad, and then Lee Van lost the 9-ball. It’s hard to come back from 3-0 down. Rubilen played well, but it wasn’t enough. That’s the sport of pool. Hopefully next time.” For the Chinese, including players, billiard officials and fans, it was a historic win that they will clearly cherish for a long time. Like all the Chinese players who are always humble to a fault, Lui Haitao spoke for everyone here about the meaning of his team’s accomplishment. “I played about as good as I can play,” said Lui Haitao. “I’m very proud to have played this well in such a big event like this. But more importantly I’m very proud of the team. We all came together and did a great job. We won this for us, and for the Chinese fans. Hopefully with this win, it will mean a better future for pool in China.”    For the win, Team China won $80,000, while the Philippines pocketed $40,000. The total prize fund was $300,000. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/65049-flying-trapeze-philippines/","title":"WATCH: You can now go on a swinging trapeze for fun in the Philippines","date":"Aug 2, 2014 11:44 AM PHT","snippet":"Dare yourself to try something different!

Watch part of a safety demonstration from Will Hsu here:  {source}<iframe width=”100%” height=”360″ src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/TvT3Ct5CsMk” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe>{/source}   “Trapeze, like any sport, has a normal progression scale,” Will says. “There are tricks that you can do as you keep at it, like double flips and catches. You’re always improving.” What you’re in for  When you decide to try out the trapeze for the first time, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, since the rig is out in the open, classes are weather-dependent. A light rain is fine, but if there’s a heavy downpour and strong winds, instructors will not hesitate to call off the session. Second, when it DOES rain, the area around the rig can get pretty muddy, so be prepared to get your sneakers or sandals dirty. If you have acrophobia (fear of heights), trapeze may not be for you. Although you do have a harness, and there’s a net to catch you if you ever fall, you’re pretty high up so you need to prepare yourself. The youngest person the FTP staff can allow on the swing is 6 years old (“We start them young,” says Will). The oldest? Will’s friend and trapeze instructor Dan Rosenzweig says, “If there’s a 90-year old who thinks he can do it, then by all means! He’s welcome to try.” Watch assistant Jade Lu and trapeze instructor Dan Rosenzweig demonstrate how they fly with ease and grace:  {source}<iframe width=”100%” height=”360″ src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/hJYTsEF4SZw” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe>{/source}   How much? FTP’s introductory rate for walk-in clients is P200 per swing and P500 for 3 swings. They also offer classes for an introductory rate of P1000 for a two-hour session during weekdays, and P1250 for evenings and weekends. Each class can take a maximum of 10 students so everyone gets equal swing time. During this opening period, if you avail of one class, you get a second session free. What else?

Columnist Enzo Flojo analyzes what lessons Gilas must take from their FIBA experiences","body":" For all intents and purposes, our third place finish in the 2014 FIBA Asia Cup in Wuhan, China was a historic accomplishment. It was the first time a Philippine team finished on the podium in the biennial event, after all. We finished with a 5-1 record, losing only to eventual champions Iran in the semifinals. We swept the group stage, beating Taiwan, Singapore, and Jordan, defeated India in the quarterfinals, and then pulled the rug from under the Chinese in the dying seconds of the battle for third. It was definitely a memorable ride for Gilas, and a fitting send-off (I’m not counting the Last Home Stand farce as a send-off) as the team embarks on a momentous trek to the 2014 FIBA World Cup in Spain. That’s not to say everything was fine and dandy, of course. In each of our wins, even against historical minnows like Singapore and India, we had to grind it out. We generally leaned on fourth quarter runs to get each of our victories, and the team was definitely far from the form it flashed in the 2013 FIBA Asia tournament. This isn’t entirely unexpected, since the team missed a handful of key players and some guys were fresh from the 2014 Governors’ Cup Finals. Conditions were definitely far from ideal, but that didn’t make it easier to watch Gilas commit turnovers and brick its shots on several occasions. (RELATED: Things We Learned in the 2014 FIBA Asia Cup – Part 1) Upon reflecting on Gilas’s campaign, I came up with the following points — things we learned from the tournament and can, hopefully, address or keep in mind moving forward. All these, of course, are for the continued improvement of Philippine hoops. This part two of a two part series.  We need some young blood When the Philippines sends national teams to continental basketball competitions, it’s very rare that amateurs or collegiate stars are involved. The last time we sent a team to the Asian Games with some college players? Hiroshima in 1994, when the Philippines fielded Rey Evangelista, Kenneth Duremdes, and Marlou Aquino? How about The last time we went to a FIBA Asia tournament with collegians? Man, I don’t even remember. Sure, the Gilas team in 2011 was a mixture of Talk N Text players and guys who were yet to be drafted in the PBA (JV Casio, Chris Tiu, Marcio Lassiter and Chris Lutz among others), but we cannot really look at those guys and say they were amateurs. At that time, Chris Tiu was already two years removed from college, and the others were in similar states. Besides, by the time they played in the 2011 FIBA Asia, they were already in their mid-20s. Want to find out which players donned the red, blue, white, and yellow when they were 22 or younger? I did some sleuthing, and here’s what I found out (only for players who were on the men’s national team before turning 23 and starting with the 1990 Asian Games squad): 1990 Beijing Asian Games: Benjie Paras (22) 1994 Hiroshima Asian Games: Rey Evangelista (22), Kenneth Duremdes (20), Marlou Aquino (22) 1998 Bangkok Asian Games: None 2002 Busan Asian Games: None 2007 FIBA Asia in Tokushima: Gabe Norwood (22) 2009 FIBA Asia in Tianjin: Japeth Aguilar (22) 2010 FIBA Asia Cup in Beirut: None 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games: Greg Slaughter (21) 2011 FIBA Asia in Wuhan: None 2012 FIBA Asia Cup in Tokyo: Matt Ganuelas (22) 2013 FIBA Asia in Manila: None 2014 FIBA Asia Cup in Wuhan: Kevin Alas (22) That’s 11 different teams and only 9 players moving up to the senior level before turning 23. Take note that I didn’t count the teams in the ABC Championships prior to 2007 because many of those were hastily-formed squads that didn’t really do justice to Philippine basketball. Why is this important? It’s important because, for our program to have some semblance of continuity, we need guys who have matured through the international basketball system. We need guys who’ve been part of the team since their U16 days. Play in the U16 team, play in the U18 team, and then advance to the men’s team. That’s the way many national programs (most notably in Europe) do things, and it definitely helps as these players won’t need to “adjust to the international game” as much as FIBA neophytes who are already in their 20s.  Here are some good examples of teams that have generally been together since their core players’ youth days: – Many of Taiwan’s top players (Tseng Wen-Ting, Wu Tai-Hao, Tien Lei, Lin Chih-Chieh, Lee Hsueh-Lin, and Chen Hsin-An are the most notable) have been together since their days as members of Taiwan’s U18 and U21 teams early in the 2000s. Tseng, Chen, Lin, and Tien, in fact, started playing for the men’s national team when they were just 17-18 years old, way back in 2001 (Chen much earlier in 1999). They were beaten badly many times, but they also learned a lot and have become top-tier competitors in the Asian circuit. Many of these guys actually play as imports in the Chinese Basketball Association, with all their efforts culminating in a top 4 finish in the 2013 FIBA Asia Men’s Championships.  – Korea is another great team that has consistently experienced a high degree of success in Asia and has participated several times at the world level (they last played in the 2012 London Olympics wildcard qualifying tournament in Valenzuela). Like Taiwan, many of their players come up through the national youth program. I remember 22-year old Oh Se-Keun burning Powerade Team Pilipinas in the 2009 FIBA Asia Men’s Championships, scoring 31 points and grabbing 10 rebounds against guys like Mick Pennisi and Sonny Thoss in the seventh place game. He led the Koreans in winning twice against the Pinoys. Korea’s roster in 2013 here in Manila actually featured a handful of guys who were 22 or younger, most notably Kim Jong-Kyu (named 2014 Rookie of the Year in the KBL), Kim Min-Goo (named to the 2013 FIBA Asia All-Star Five), and Lee Jong-Hyun (6-foot-9 and then 18-year old who led Korean to a second place finish in the 2012 FIBA Asia U18 tourney).  – Of course, when we talk about continuity, we have to talk about current Asian kings, Iran. Unknown to a lot of people, the core of Hamed Haddadi, Samad Nikkhah Bahrami, Mahdi Kamrani, and Hamed Afagh has been together since 2003 (a couple of years later, Samad Nikkhah’s older brother, Aidin Nikkhah, who died in 2008, was also part of the team and was just as good as his sibling). They didn’t win a lot in the 2003 and 2005 editions of the FIBA Asia competitions (they finished with 8 wins and 6 losses in those two tournaments, placing fifth and sixth respectively), but they stuck together and matured as a team. Eventually, they won the diadem in 2007, 2009, and 2013. They have also won the FIBA Asia Cup twice (2012 and 2014) and have qualified to world-level jousts (the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the 2010 FIBA World Championships, and the 2014 FIBA World Cup). Iran’s golden generation will enjoy great continuity, though, as young guns like Mohammad Jamshidi, Sajjad Mashayekhi, and Behnam Yakhchali have had significant experience playing at the senior level, too.  As for the Philippines? Well, many of our top youth players are limited to playing in their respective amateur/inter-school leagues, and they need to secure a gamut of permissions before they’re allowed to don the country’s colors in international contests.   I mean, when will see guys like Kiefer Ravena, Baser Amer, Kobe Paras, Mac Belo, and Troy Rosario play at the senior level? When they’re in their mid-20s? How about Fil-foreigners who have already played for our U16 teams? Guys like Matthew Wright (Fil-Canadian) and Jordan Heading (Fil-Australian)? Have we moved heaven and earth to entice them to come back?  Needless to say, seamless continuity will remain a dream unless we…  Change our basketball calendar This is something a lot of local hoop nuts have been clamoring for since the days of the 1998 Centennial Team (or even before that). In the Philippines, basketball, quite literally, never stops. The PBA goes on for about 9 months. After that, we have the UAAP, NCAA, and other collegiate leagues dominating the scene for about 3 months. And then the PBA again. Oh, and let’s not forget how much we worship the NBA from the preseason, regular season, playoffs, and free agency.  For the media, fans, and corporations interested in marketing their products through basketball, this is great. There’s no downtime. And now that social media has taken over, basketball is practically an endless, 24/7 cycle (yes, that’s meant to be redundant to further emphasize the point).  Sometimes, I feel our obsession with hoops is a double-edged sword.   This is why I applaud the UAAP’s decision to move the Season 77 Juniors tournament to the second semester. This allows teenagers like Mike Nieto, Matt Nieto, Jolo Mendoza, and Mark Dyke to play in the 2014 FIBA U17 World Championships in August without having to choose between their schools or the national team. I hope that, someday, the other amateur leagues can do the same thing. With the new way FIBA will set its competitions up starting in 2017, we really will need “FIBA windows” for our national teams (on every level) to be competitive.  I really hope the time will come when there will be no local leagues playing around June, July, or August. But, if that happens, what kind of basketball can Pinoys watch in those cold, rainy months (aside from FIBA)? That’s a good question, and the answer is…  To have our own Jones Cup We’ve had pocket tournaments in the past (remember the one where Mac Cardona gets it on with the Dongguan Leopards?), but those have never been on the same caliber or level of the William Jones Cup in Taiwan.  I believe that, given our fabulous fan base and the resources and political will of MVP, the SBP, and the PBA, we can organize a midyear regional basketball tournament that can rival and even overshadow the Jones Cup. This is especially so given the recent success of Gilas. Who wouldn’t want to play against a World Cup-bound team with the continent’s best point guard and a bona fide NBA center in front of the world’s most raucous basketball fans and inside an NBA-grade arena? Add a hefty cash prize and, I’m pretty sure, foreign national teams and club teams will be lining up at the door. Invite Lebanon, which has recently been reinstated by FIBA and is itching to play against other countries. Invite India, whose gung-ho coach is looking for as many opportunities to expose his players to international play. Invite Kuwait, so Rabeh Al-Hussaini can come home and face his Meralco bosses. Invite the Qataris, who are always game to play physical ball with the Filipinos. Invite Stephon Marbury’s Beijing Ducks. Invite coach Rajko Toroman’s Jordanians. Invite the Singapore Slingers. Invite the Aussies and the Kiwis.  It’s possible, I tell you. And because it won’t be a FIBA event, we wouldn’t have to worry about nit-picky constraints on advertising and marketing, too. If we have our own version of the Jones Cup (maybe call it the Manila Hoops Classic or, simply, the Loyzaga Cup?), this means we won’t have to bring our local talents out of the country as much because international competition will be coming here instead.  All these are lofty aspirations, yes, but with some wheeling and dealing I’m sure the bigwigs in the SBP, PBA, UAAP, NCAA, and other stakeholders can pull these off. It’s a long shot, but it’s not impossible.  And when (not if) these things finally come to fruition, then I have no doubt in my mind that the very best of Pinoy basketball will reach even greater heights than they did in the 2013 FIBA Asia Championships and the 2014 FIBA World Cup. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/63783-philippines-china-fiba-asia-cup-battle-third/","title":"Lee free throws give Gilas bronze in FIBA Asia Cup","date":"Jul 19, 2014 7:01 PM PHT","snippet":"It is the Philippines' best-ever finish in the FIBA Asia Cup, formerly known as the Stankovic Cup, beating China in their home soil, 80-79","body":""},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/60586-know-your-noodle-asian-dishes/","title":"Know your noodles: 6 Asian favorites","date":"Jun 15, 2014 11:15 AM PHT","snippet":"Tired of your usual bowl? Try another!","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Noodles. The familiar, long strands of goodness continue to be a staple food in most Asian cuisines, and with good reason. Served in hot soup, wrapped up in rolls, fried and tossed with vegetables, noodles are extremely versatile and can be enjoyed in a variety of dishes. But what is it that makes each kind of noodle special and where can we grab a bowl of it? Here are just a few of many, many noodle variations: 1. SOBA   What is it? Soba is a common Japanese noodle made from buckwheat and wheat flour, and cut into strips by hand. What it looks like? One of the most common Japanese noodles, soba noodles look a lot like the average spaghetti. They are thin and slightly brown-gray in color. Enjoy! The great thing about soba noodles is that they can be enjoyed chilled with some dipping sauce, or hot in bowl of soup.  2. UDON   What is it? Udon noodles are Japanese noodles made by kneading wheat flour, salt, and water together. What does it look like? Another popular type of noodle in Japan, udon noodles are differentiated from the rest by its thick and round shape, and its whitish color.   Enjoy! Udon noodles are usually chewy, soft, and neutral in taste. Much like soba noodles, they can be enjoyed chilled in the summer or hot in the winter. 3. RAMEN NOODLES  What is it? The noodle dish itself is called ramen, but the noodles in a bowl of ramen are usually made of wheat flour, sometimes with egg.  What does it look like? Ramen noodles vary in look, depending on the chef preparing them and what region of Japan he hails from. But usually, they are thin, long, and slightly golden. Enjoy! These noodles are best enjoyed in a hot meat or fish-based broth that has been prepared for hours (sometimes overnight!) and flavored with soy sauce, salt, or miso.    4. LA MIAN   What is it? “La mian” means stretched or pulled noodles. It’s made by hand by continuously stretching and folding the dough into thin strands.   What does it look like? La mian noodles are typically long and ribbon thin, with the width depending on how many times the dough has been pulled.  Enjoy! In dishes, it is often served with beef and a brothy soup, but is also commonly served in a stir-fry fashion with veggies, seafood and sauce.    5. Cellophane/Vermicelli noodles    What is it? Cellophane noodles are noodles made from starch, yam, or mung bean.   What does it look like? This type of noodle is characterized by its translucent look when cooked. It is for this same reason that they are also often called glass noodles, though other types of noodles also take on a similar form.  Enjoy! Cellophane noodles are often used as filling for spring rolls and complete the combo of veggies and meat normally found in this appetizer. They can also be cooked along with meats and seafood, making a flavorful viand.    6. Rice Noodles   What is it? The kind of noodle commonly used in pho (a type of Vietnamese soup) and in pad thai noodles.   What does it look like? In its most basic form, rice noodles tend to look like white spaghetti. The thickness of the rice noodle varies depending on whether extra starch or tapioca was added in the process. The thinner variation of rice noodles is called rice vermicelli, often used in Cantonese noodle dishes. The slightly wider version is the type used in pad thai. Enjoy! Whether used in a bowl of Vietnamese pho or a plate of pad thai, rice noodles prove to be a good complement to the medley of flavors in the dish.   Which is your favorite?

Aquino heckler faces charges. Jolie: Warzone rape an int'l agenda","body":"Today on Rappler.     SANDIGANBAYAN ASSIGNS PLUNDER, GRAFT CASES Anti-graft court Sandiganbayan raffles the plunder and graft cases of Senators Juan Ponce Enrile, Jinggoy Estrada, and Bong Revilla, Friday. Revilla’s cases were assigned to the 1st division, Enrile’s to the 3rd division, and Estrada’s to the 5th division. The 1st division is chaired by Justice Efren dela Cruz, the 3rd division by Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice Amparo Cabotaje-Tang, and the 5th division by Justice Roland Jurado. The justices will determine probable cause to proceed with the case. If they find basis, they can issue arrest warrants. The Sandiganbayan’s sheriff will implement the order.  Arrest warrants may not come immediately. Justice Gregory Ong of the 4th division inhibited himself from hearing the plunder and graft cases.  Ong is under investigation for allegedly visiting the office of pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Napoles during the time she was reportedly handing out bribes. Napoles was also charged before the Sandiganbayan last Friday.  She is co-defendant in cases against the 3 senators. The filing of charges came almost a year after news on the corruption scandal broke in July 2013.   AHEAD OF ARREST, JPE PLEADS FOR TEMPORARY LIBERTY Senator Enrile appeals to the Sandiganbayan to allow him to post bail, even before an arrest warrant is issued. In a motion filed Friday, Enrile asks the court to set the amount of bail for his plunder case ahead of its determination of probable cause. He adds, his request to post bail is in “the remote event” the Sandiganbayan affirms the Ombudsman’s findings and issues a warrant. The 90-year-old Enrile says he is not a flight risk, citing his “poor and frail condition requiring constant medical attention.” Attached to Enrile’s motion were medical certificates attesting to his poor health. A May 8 certification says Enrile is under the care of Doctor Claver Ramos of the Makati Medical Center. Enrile was diagnosed with chronic hypertension, elevated fasting blood sugar, and mild anemia, among others. In a separate medical certificate, Doctor Ramos said Enrile is on at least 22 different medications for various health complications. Another medical certificate signed by Doctor Amadeo Veloso Junior of the Asian Eye Institute attests that Enrile has “age-related macular degeneration” on both eyes. Enrile faces 15 counts of graft, which is bailable.  Senators Revilla and Estrada already filed their motions for judicial determination of probable cause. The anti-graft court is expected to require the Ombudsman to comment on the issues they raised. Interior Secretary Mar Roxas says the Philippine National Police is ready to follow the anti-graft court’s orders, as it is the rule of law. MAR ROXAS, INTERIOR SECRETARY: Makakaasa ang mga kababayan at sinuman na gagamapanan ng PNP in a professional manner kung ano man ang utos ng korte with continuity and respect for the law. Walang sisinuhin at walang papanigan kung hindi ang utos lang ng korte. (Filipinos can be assured that the PNP will follow the court’s instructions in a professional manner, with respect for the law. The PNP will not side with anyone, and will instead simply follow the court.)   REVILLA: THOUGHT OF ARREST GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS Senator Revilla says he’s getting the chills, with the raffle of pork barrel scam cases at the Sandiganbayan making his arrest just a matter of time. While he is ready to be arrested anytime, Revilla dreads the thought of being behind bars. He and his bosom buddy Senator Estrada say their only wish is for the justices to handle their cases with fairness. In a radio interview Friday, Revilla says if he had his way, the warrant should be out soon. He says he wants to get to the bottom of the country’s biggest corruption scandal in recent history, reiterating his support for the creation of special court divisions to fast-track the trial. Revilla also takes a swipe at President Aquino’s Independence Day speech where the chief executive urged Filipinos not to vote for those who are merely “good in reading scripts, great dancers or excellent singers.” The senator says he felt alluded to, with his privilege speech featuring a much-derided music video.  He said the President should just name him outright instead of belittling celebrities, as Aquino himself has a sister in show business- TV host Kris Aquino. The Ombudsman says Revilla got the biggest kickback worth P242 million, followed by Estrada with P183 million, and Enrile with P172 million.   STUDENT WHO HECKLED AQUINO RELEASED FROM JAIL An Ateneo de Naga student who heckled President Benigno Aquino on Independence day is released from jail Friday. The 19-year-old Pio Mijares spent Thursday detained at the Naga City Police Office after disrupting President Aquino’s speech. Mijares reportedly called Aquino the “pork barrel king” and demanded for his ouster. Student activist groups hail Mijares’ fearlessness and condemn his arrest, saying he only exercised his right to free speech. A Bicol Standard report says Mijares is affiliated with groups Kabataan Partylist, Youth Act Now, and Anakbayan. Mijares faces two criminal charges: one for tumults and other disturbances of public order, and another for assault upon an agent of a person in authority.   8 CHED OFFICIALS FACE RAPS FOR TUITION HIKE APPROVAL Youth groups and students file criminal and administrative charges against Commission on Higher Education officials before the Ombudsman Friday. The education officials, led by chair Patricia Licuanan, face charges for approving tuition hikes in higher education institutions. The petitioners say the officials failed to decide on complaints against the tuition hike proposals prior to approval.  The petitioners add, CHED failed to enforce its 2012 resolution against the collection of “development fees” in schools. They also accuse CHED of “incompetence, inefficiency, and negligence in handling complaints.”   COLLEGE PROFESSORS FEAR MASSIVE RETRENCHMENT DUE TO K TO 12 The law promising to produce employable Filipino high school graduates is causing panic among educators in higher institutions. Professors from various colleges and universities fear displacement of academic personnel, as the K to 12 program is implemented nationwide in 2016. With the signing of the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013, two years are added to the basic education system of the Philippines.  The tertiary level expects a drop in enrollment during these two years all the way to school year 2021-2022.  The enrollment is expected to normalize 7 years from now. Rene Tadle of the University of Santo Tomas’ faculty estimates around 30,000 professors and 15,000 non-teaching staff will be affected by retrenchments. He says teachers given the option to retire early may be too old to find another job.  Losing a teaching job also means loss of benefits.   INTERIM THAI GOVERNMENT BY SEPTEMBER: JUNTA CHIEF Thailand’s army chief General Prayut Chan-O-Cha says on Friday his country’s junta will form an interim government by September. He adds, the interim government will oversee political reforms, and elections will be held in about a year. Prayut, who led a May 22 coup that deposed an elected government, did not say whether the cabinet will be made up of civilians or military officers. He says, “Don’t ask me who they are and where they come from.” The junta chief does not rule out becoming prime minister.  Since declaring martial law on May 19th, the junta curtailed civil liberties by banning public protests, arresting demonstrators, censoring media and temporarily detaining hundreds of critics. Prayut says the measures are necessary to end almost a decade of political turmoil and street violence. Critics accuse the junta of using political unrest as an excuse to grab power from the Shinawatras. Thaksin and sister Yingluck both became prime ministers but were ousted 8 years apart by military-backed royalists.   JOLIE ON WAR RAPE: DO NOT GO SILENT  The four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict comes to a close Friday. Co-chaired by United Nations Special Envoy Angelina Jolie and British Foreign Secretary William Hague,  the event brings together representatives from various sectors around the world to discuss how to end warzone rape. During the closing plenary, United Nations’ Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says sexual violence in conflict is called the world’s oldest but least condemned crime. BAN KI-MOON, UN SECRETARY-GENERAL: Rape is a cruel weapon of war that is devastating as any bullet, and as destructive as any bomb. It ravages victims and their families. It destroys communities. It can be stopped. The United Nations is working to stamp out sexual violence in conflict, while supporting victims. Political will is growing. Jolie reaffirms her commitment to ending warzone violence. She says the international community still has more to do, from eradicating rape to transforming victims into survivors. ANGELINA JOLIE, UN SPECIAL ENVOY: We need to entrench the international protocol so that we begin to deter these crimes, end impunity.  The test we now face is whether we can make a difference on the ground, and we need to act urgently. We can never again plead ignorance – we know what is at stake – and we must work to end impunity in those conflicts now. For this to happen, warzone rape must remain at the top of the international agenda. My message to you, is please do not go silent. Raise your voices, and use your influence to inspire the next generation of men to value and honor women. Meeting at the sidelines of the summit are representatives from Nigeria and neighboring countries to discuss the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in Nigeria. The group formulated a plan in Paris to “declare war” on Islamic insurgents who kidnapped hundreds of schoolgirls to be sold into slavery.  They say, “The abduction of the Chibok schoolgirls was a heinous example of the scourge of sexual violence,  which we are determined to eliminate around the world.”    THE wRap: YOUR WORLD IN ONE READ wRap #6: STUDENT’S MOTHER FILES FIRST DAMAGES SUIT OVER S.

Jin was the solo visible Asian in the mock police station set in the Windy City, which lists 148,000 or 5.5 percent of its population in the 2010 US Census as single-race Asian.   (Filipinos, by the way, outnumber their Asian cousins in Carl Sandburg’s City of Broad Shoulders, at 29,664, according to USA.com, few hundred shy of East Indians – or as they call themselves in California – South Asians, at 29,948, the most populous from the largest continent.)  Strange seeing the lonely Jew navigate a sea of white with dashes of black.  But there he was, giving new meaning to “Charity begins at home,” and paying the ultimate price for it.  As the hit series debut season drew to a close, Jew’s stunned buddies – 4 Caucasians including one woman, one Latino, one African American – contemplated the rubout.  NBC had no problem rehashing the idea for its brand-new psych thriller The Black List.  Was I elated to find early on not one but two Asian women in strong un-cliché roles in the series exploring the relationship of a global criminal brainiac and the always one step-behind CIA?  The series had just begun when one of the Asian – one of two aides of color (the other a black male) to the James Spader character, the brilliant but amoral – has her brains splattered on an indestructible cage that prevents “Red’s” foe du jour from reaching his prey.  Remember the other Asian female in the cast?    Well Meera Malik was of Indian or South Asian descent, like her alterego actor Parminder Nagra, who hit the big time in Bend it like Beckham followed by stints on “ER.” With a British accent, the perfect analyst, right?    TV tells us people who speak like Queen Elizabeth II or her colonial subjects overpopulate the United States – sitcoms, drama, news and talk shows, reality programs – even commercials, for crying out loud.  Best way to win fans across the Pond and mollify Asians in one fell swoop? For a few weeks, tops.  Because while tracking a terrorist in a nightclub pulsating with techno blasts and blinking lights, no one notices when a fist reaches from behind to slice Malik’s throat. Similar fate met Hetienne Park or investigator Beverly Katz, dissected in the final episode of the second season of Hannibal.  Why is it so easy for mainstream networks – or is it just NBC – to kill off Asians? And of all times in May, Asian American Heritage – just happens to be the end of regular programming season.  A long long time ago, programming “played to Peoria,” meaning shows should appeal to the nation’s heartland where Nielsen ratings count most.  But don’t CMOs know that Asians are the fastest growing demographic in the country?  “Out of the total US population, 14.7 million people, or 4.8 percent, were Asian alone. In addition, 2.6 million people, or another 0.9 percent, reported Asian in combination with one or more other races. Together, these two groups totaled 17.3 million people. Thus, 5.6% of all people in the United States identified as Asian, either alone or in combination with one or more other races,” said a 2012 report by the US Census Bureau. Fortunately Asians enjoy bigger but still all-too-brief exposure in sitcoms.  Pat Morita’s Mr. T and Tina in 1976 and Margaret Cho’s All-American Girl in 1994, both on ABC, were the first network shows to focus on multigenerational Asian Americans, short-lived but dauntlessly visionary. Rob Schneider’s eponymous Rob on CBS focused on his Mexican American in-laws while glossing over Schneider’s heritage.    The Saturday Night Live alum grabs every chance to disclose he is Filipino (a quarter, actually, his mom being half-Filipina, but no one’s divvying up Filipinoness here.) Add Vanessa Lachey to a rare Fil-Am on a sitcom, the forgettable Dads on Fox.  Coming up is Fresh off the Boat, also on ABC, written by Eddie Huang, who describes himself as “Taiwanese-Chinese-American” but “never American.”    Huang was born in Washington, DC to immigrant parents.  He makes no apologies for his show’s title because it represents his personal family experience, he said.  Unfortunately the term turns off many Asians who consider it a slur and may cause its early demise.  In which case should Asian Americans  be satisfied seeing brief representations of themselves in plum network dramas that end with their spectacular execution? That would be tragic because dramas are the fount of industry accolades therefore professional success. How can Asians on network TV rise to the stature of Denzel Washington, whose work on NBC’s St. Elsewhere sported the promise of a couple Oscars, if the bamboo ceiling kills them so soon? Will it take an Asian American network chief to invest in Asian American talent having discerned a gold mine in Asian Americans? Or should we concede that only in a 50th-state based drama will we find ourselves reflected almost accurately, diversely, in all our positive and less-so glory?    Think Hawaii Five-0.  Where Asian Americans number half of the population, we have cops, perps and vics, surfer dudes and working folk of every Asian background in various scenes on this CBS hit, so we can ignore that a hunky Aussie plays the formidable Steve McGarrett. But there’s Darren Criss or Blaine Anderson on Fox musical Glee, and even I had no idea he was Filipino until I accidentally walked into his 2010 press conference in Makati. Maybe that’s it:  Filipino diversity perplexes networks that know little of Philippine and Fil-Am history beyond what sells gossip rags and sites. Now Glee is non-drama, unlike Grimm, the only major network program I know that stars a Fil-Am, Reggie Lee, who was born Reggie Valdez in Quezon City.  Interestingly he chose his screen name because he was getting lots of offers to play “Hispanic” roles, he said, and he doesn’t “even look Hispanic.” So what does he play on the horror drama?

Carey did the work on the boards as well with 8 rebounds.   Even Nonoy Baclao, who only figured in 3 points, made some noise in this game particulalry on defense with his 10 rebounds and two blocks.   Head coach Norman Black was happy his team managed a dominant win but admitted he wasn’t satisfied with his import’s performance.   “It was a good job again by my local players. They really stepped up and really led us to this victory. And that’s really been the key to our success the last week,” Black said. “But we still need a little bit more support from our import.”  While his team survived the past week after they lost their original import Othyus Jeffers due to contractual problems, Black is wary about how they’ll manage with Rodney Carney as the conference wears on.    “That’s really a big question right now because we obviously need more support from the import,” Black explained.   “Fortunately for myself and for the team, the local unit has stepped up and kind of filled in the void of what’s been missing offensively and defensively. But you can’t expect that to happen all the time or every game.” In this game, Carney had a lackluster showing of just 12 points and two rebounds. He went only 1-of-5 from the field and was pushed to the outside where he scored on 3-of-7 from beyond the arc.  Black said he will be discussing with his coaching staff and the management on what they will do with their import moving forward.   Air21, on the other hand, was simply out of their element in this game and while they did attempt a final run in the fourth that brought them to within 97-87 with 3:02 left, the lead proved too big to overcome with so little time remaining and against a team with so many weapons.  Import Dominique Sutton had a 31-point, 14-rebound performance in tandem with Asi Taulava’s 20 points and 15 boards.  After a spirited start to the conference, the Express are now in third place with a 3-2 slate.  Scores Talk ’N Text 102 – De Ocampo 24, Castro 19, Alapag 16, Carney 12, Williams 11, Carey 10, Fonacier 5, Baclao 3, Canaleta 2, Reyes Rob 0, Reyes Ryan 0.

US reporters for CBS television news and the online site Buzzfeed, and a team with Britain’s Sky News were grabbed at rebel-held checkpoints as they tried to enter the town. The CBS reporter, Clarissa Ward, told her network that after being abducted she and her colleagues were taken to different locations, and at one point blindfolded. A male member of the team was beaten. One pro-Russian rebel commander explained to them that the insurgents’ nerves were frayed by the military onslaught and assured them they would come to no harm. Eventually they were freed. Buzzfeed’s Mike Giglio, an experienced correspondent who used to work for Newsweek, tweeted that he endured a similar experience. He said the rebels were overheard talking about keeping them as hostages, and one person in his group was punched twice. Once the rebels decided to release them, they were “politely” served tea. But the militants stole his flak jacket and helmet, saying they were “something for us to remember you by.” A Sky spokeswoman, meanwhile, confirmed to Agence France-Presse: “A Sky News crew was detained for a number of hours this morning in eastern Ukraine. We are glad they have since been released and are safe and well.” Last month, the rebels in Slavyansk grabbed another American journalist, Simon Ostrovsky of VICE News, and kept him for 4 days. He, too, said he was beaten initially. After being called a “provocateur,” the 33-year-old was released. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said that a lifenews.ru correspondent in Slavyansk, Hermine Kotanjyan, reportedly also received death threats through social media. On Thursday, armed men entered a regional television station in Lugansk and programming was changed from the First Ukrainian National Channel to Russia 24, the OSCE said. On the same day a Radio Liberty journalist was intimidated and bullied by the crowd in Kharkiv while reporting on a protest, and had to seek police protection, the OSCE said. The security body’s media freedom representative, Dunja Mijatovic, renewed her call on all parties to show respect for media freedom in Ukraine. “On the eve of World Press Freedom Day we are witnessing journalists in Ukraine being subjected to brutal violence, kidnappings and intimidation while media outlets are repeatedly seized by armed individuals who switch off Ukrainian broadcasts to replace them with Russian ones,” Mijatovic said in a statement. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/56429-obama-one-eye-asia-global-turbulence/","title":"Obama: one eye on Asia, another on global turbulence","date":"Apr 26, 2014 12:49 PM PHT","snippet":"Foreign policy crises are chasing Barack Obama around Asia, drawing his attention from a key region and providing fodder for domestic critics who see him as a toothless leader outmaneuvered by foes like Russia's Vladimir Putin","body":" SEOUL, South Korea – Foreign policy crises are chasing Barack Obama around Asia, drawing his attention from a key region and providing fodder for domestic critics who see him as a toothless leader outmaneuvered by foes like Russia’s Vladimir Putin. To put in proportion the problems piled on the US president’s plate, consider that a potential North Korean nuclear test and boiling tensions between his top Asian allies and China don’t even top his list of foreign policy headaches. Given global turmoil, the US president was never likely to be able to keep both eyes on Asia during this week’s trip. And so it has proven, as a Cold War-style showdown with the Kremlin and a crumbling Middle East peace process challenge Obama‘s chosen legacy-building narrative of locking in America as a preeminent Pacific power. “I don’t have the luxury of choosing just one problem at a time,” Obama told a South Korean journalist who wondered if his attention on North Korea was being diverted by events in Ukraine. Obama’s constant companion Crises have been Obama‘s constant companion since he arrived in the White House in 2009 during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. If his current four nation odyssey – itself a make-up for a trip that fell prey to domestic political dysfunction last year – is a guide, crises will also usher him out of office in two-and-a-half years’ time. On Friday night, April 25, Obama rushed from dinner with South Korean President Park Geun-Hye to convene a conference call with European leaders aimed at toughening sanctions on Russia over Ukraine. Then North Korea unveiled late Friday its latest headline-grabbing seizure of an American citizen who was detained at immigration.FumingBig chunks of Obama‘s news conferences with Park and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe were devoted to long explanations of his plans to thwart Putin or vows to stick with Middle East peacemaking. “That was a long statement, I must say,” Park chided, after a detailed Obama answer on Ukraine on Friday. White House officials would dearly like some glowing US media reviews of the tour. But the president’s case was not helped when he left Japan without a market access deal in a dispute blocking the Trans Pacific Partnership trade pact – a project that would adorn his legacy of “rebalancing” American power towards Asia. The TPP’s importance was clear when senior officials rushed to set the narrative on Air Force One as Obama flew to Seoul, insisting a “breakthrough” pointing the way to an eventual resolution had been charted in round-the-clock talks in Japan.Tough tourThe prevailing media frame of Obama‘s second term is of a diminished leader buffeted by political winds he can no longer redirect and world events crowding his Asian tour deepened that perception. CNN blared: “Obama‘s tough Asian tour” in an on-screen graphic. Politico Playbook, a popular tip sheet for Washington insiders, asked readers: “Be honest, did you even know Obama was away?” On one level, Washington chatter matters little to Obama, who never has to face voters again.And while it may be ignored back home, Obama has sent clear messages of his intent to defend Japan – to elite audiences in Tokyo and Beijing. Obama‘s visit is getting big play in Asian media – dominating front pages wherever he goes.People close to Obama say he can’t bear the short-termism and frivolity of Washington politics. In Asia by contrast, he is playing the long game with his legacy on the line: but his time is short and leaders like China’s President Xi Jinping, Abe, and Park will likely still be around after he is pensioned off in January 2017. But the reviews back home do matter to Democrats desperate to cling onto the Senate – the president’s approval ratings are a critical driver of their prospects at mid-term elections in November. Republicans and media critics have jumped on Obama‘s foreign policy woes to sketch a caricature of a president who blinked on striking Syria and now sees adversaries ready to step over his red lines all over the world. “President Putin is only emboldened by empty rhetoric, so it is time for the administration to back up their talk by immediately putting in place tough sanctions against Russian banks and energy companies,” said Senator Bob Corker, one of Obama‘s more measured Republican critics. Obama is tired of all the “weak president” buzz and a perception that only military force provides a “definitive answer” in foreign policy. “You would think, given that we’ve just gone through – a decade of war, that that assumption would be subject to some questioning,” he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/56303-april-24-2014-drilon-pork-barrel-scam-miriam-santiago-enrile-lacson-obama-japan-china/","title":"Rappler Newscast | April 24, 2014","date":"Apr 24, 2014 7:49 PM PHT","snippet":"Drilon opposes release of more senators’ names in the pork barrel scam.

How can we trust that she is saying the whole truth and without any lies now?”   STORY 2: DRILON: DON’T RELEASE NAPOLES LIST WITHOUT DOCSUnlike his other colleagues, Senate President Franklin Drilon does not want the list of lawmakers implicated in the pork barrel scam released if it’s not supported by “compelling documentary evidence.”Drilon says releasing the list without documents will harm the Senate’s image.He also cites cited legal arguments to justify the need for Napoles to produce supporting documents.Drilon says, “No other evidence is better than the document because documents do not lie.”The senate president also warns against “mudslinging and smear campaigns,” referring to rumors that his name was included in Napoles’ list.   STORY 3: MIRIAM SEES ENRILE HAND IN LACSON EXPOSÉ Senator Miriam Santiago thinks Senator Juan Ponce Enrile has a hand in the latest exposé of former senator Panfilo Lacson.Santiago questions Lacson’s statement that the family of Janet Napoles gave him a draft affidavit…reportedly naming 12 senators and more than 100 congressmen in the corruption scandal.Santiago says Lacson showed no proof the affidavit was authentic. Napoles’ lawyer Bruce Rivera confirms the Napoleses approached Lacson…before meeting with Justice Secretary Leila de Lima Monday.Santiago says she believes Lacson is only speaking to prevent Napoles from naming Enrile as the scam leader. Santiago has repeatedly tagged Enrile as the real brains behind the scheme.She says “There is no secret that I think the most guilty here is former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile. No matter what the level of Napoles’ cunning might be, she cannot equal the influence of the Senate President.”She also calls Lacson Enrile’s “attack dog.”Responding to Santiago’s comments, Lacson says, “Let her quake in her shoes. More than anybody else, she, Benhur Luy and Mrs Napoles… knows where she stands on the pork barrel and fertilizer scam issues.”Santiago clashed with Lacson after he defended Enrile at the height of the controversy. The two have since exchanged sharp criticism.Enrile and Senators Bong Revilla and Jinggoy Estrada face plunder charges for allegedly funneling their pork barrel funds to Napoles’ fake NGOs in exchange for kickbacks.   STORY 4: BIR ‘HAPPY’ WITH COMPROMISE PACQUIAO CASH BOND The Bureau of Internal Revenue or BIR says it is “happy” with the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals on the tax evasion case of boxer Manny Pacquiao.The court resolution suspends the BIR’s collection of Pacquiao’s alleged unpaid taxes, but requires him to pay cash bond.BIR Deputy Commissioner Estela Sales says the resolution still protects government interest.Pacquiao allegedly owes the government 2.2 billion pesos or around 49.21 million dollars in unpaid taxes.The BIR says Pacquiao did not report his dollar winnings from his fights in 2008 and 2009.   STORY 5: OBAMA TO SPEND DAY 2 OF PH VISIT WITH FILIPINO SOLDIERS US President Barack Obama will spend the second day of his trip to the Philippines with Filipino troops at the military headquarters in Taguig City.The US Embassy says Obama will deliver a speech “recognizing the longstanding partnership and cooperation” between the two countries’ armed forces.Malacanang says defense is the top agenda of Obama’s visit on April 28 to 29.The Philippines seeks military assistance from the US in the face of Chinese aggression in the South China Sea.Obama’s visit also comes as the Philippines and the US are set to sign a military deal that would allow US troops access to Philippine military bases. STORY 6: OBAMA IN TOKYO BACKS JAPAN IN CHINA ISLAND ROW US President Obama promises to defend Japan if China attacks over the two countries’ territorial dispute.Both claim the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which China calls the Diaoyus.In his visit to Japan — the first stop of his Asian tour — Obama says the disputed islands are covered by a defense treaty that would oblige Washington to act if Japan is attacked.While talks on security were positive, trade talks between the US and Japan stall.Both leaders hoped to announce a breakthrough on the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP, a proposed 12-nation free trade bloc.But on Thursday, Obama says the two sides have not found common ground on key issues…like restrictions on access to Japan’s agricultural and automobile sectors.   STORY 7: CHINESE DIPLOMAT CALLS FOR BILATERAL RESOLUTION As US President Obama tours Asia…Chinese diplomat Liu Zhenmin presses for the bilateral resolution of disputes in the West Philippine Sea or South China Sea.China and the Philippines both claim territories in the South China Sea.The Philippines brought the case to a United Nations tribunal for arbitration.In an article written by Liu Tuesday, he says disputing countries should settle their differences directly, and not through a third party.He adds, “China never imposes its practice or opinions on other countries; even less does it attempt to grab the interests of other countries by use of threat or force.” The statement contradicts the Philippine government’s claims of repeated harassment by Chinese ships in disputed areas.   STORY 8: PHILIPPINE AIRLINES BANS SHARK FIN IN CARGO FLIGHTS Philippine Airlines takes a stand for marine conservation, joining other Asia-Pacific carriers that stopped carrying shark fin as cargo.In a statement Thursday, PAL says it “values the issue on protection and conservation of endangered marine life seriously… recognizing that the company’s long-term interest is and should be consistent with sustainable and responsible business practices.”In 2013, Air New Zealand and South Korea’s two largest airlines, Korean Air and Asiana, said they would ban shark fins from their cargo flights.Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific also stopped shipping them in 2012.The fins are used in shark fin soup, a much-valued delicacy in Hong Kong and China.Conservationists call for measures to restrict shark fin trade as booming demand endangers the world’s shark populations.   STORY 9: THE wRap: YOUR WORLD IN ONE READ At number 5, South Korean authorities search the office of the company that owns the ferry that sank last week, with more than 300 high school students on board. The family of Yoo Byung-eun, known as the “millionaire with no face,” appears to control Cheonghaejin Marine Company. CNN reports the company has been struggling and reported losses in 2013. Days after the ferry sank on April 16, the company’s president apologized for the tragedy.As of early Thursday, 159 bodies have been recovered, leaving at least 143 more missing. At number 7, Facebook’s profits nearly triple in the first quarter of 2014. The reason? Mobile users and more mobile advertising.The social network registers earnings of $642 million, helped in part by advertising revenues that soared by 82% to $2.27 billion from 2013.

Lacson: pork barrel scam critics got kickbacks. Napoles’ lawyer says his client did not ask to be a state witness","body":" Today on Rappler.  Story 1: HK, PH RESOLVE HOSTAGE CRISIS ISSUEThe Philippines and Hong Kong finally resolve differences over the 2010 bus hostage crisis in Manila.8 Hong Kong tourists died in the mismanaged rescue attempt.In February, Hong Kong imposed sanctions stopping visa-free entry for Philippine officials after its demand for an official apology from Manila failed.With the agreement, these sanctions are now dropped.On Wednesday, the Philippines and Hong Kong issue a joint statement, saying the 4 demands set by the victims’ families have been resolved.Still, the Philippines does not issue an official apology.The statement says the Philippines -quote- “expresses its most sorrowful regret and profound sympathy, and extends its most sincere condolences” to the families.The Philippine government will also give “an additional token of solidarity” to the victims’ families.Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada left for Hong Kong Tuesday with an undisclosed sum of money. Story 2: NAPOLES NOT DEMANDING TO BE STATE WITNESS – LAWYERThe lawyer of Janet Napoles says his client is not demanding to be a state witness in exchange for her testimony on the pork barrel scam.In an interview with ANC’s Headstart, lawyer Bruce Rivera says Napoles set no conditions for her affidavit when she met with Justice Secretary Leila de Lima.De Lima earlier said Napoles submitted her account and asked to be a state witness in the pork barrel scam case.Rivera denies this, saying, “It’s false to assume that she wants to be state witness because the testimony…was purely a proper testimony. There were really no conditions as to what she wants to happen.”The Ombudsman is set to file plunder charges against Napoles and 9 others for allegedly channeling public funds to fake NGOs.De Lima says the department will have to evaluate Napoles’ affidavit first to determine if she can be a state witness…but whistleblowers are concerned.Raymond Mendoza, lawyer of whistleblower Benhur Luy, says if Napoles becomes a witness in the case, she should –quote– “not contradict what has already been laid down” by the whistleblowers at the Senate hearings.If she does, Mendoza says it would be a battle for credibility. Story 3: SENATORS TO NAPOLES: FACE US, NAME NAMESNot all senators are open to the possibility of Janet Napoles turning state witness. Senator Koko Pimentel earlier said Napoles was the most guilty as the “architect” of the scam.Earlier, Senator Miriam Santiago urged the Senate blue ribbon committee to summon Napoles and reopen the investigation.Senator Sonny Trillanes supports her call, saying only a Senate testimony will test Napoles’ credibility.But Senator Serge Osmena says Blue Ribbon committee chair TG Guingona must make sure Napoles will say something substantial before inviting her.Trillanes and Osmena also say they’re willing to look past Napoles’ initial denials of her involvement in the scam to prosecute other corrupt officials.The Justice Department also says it would suspend judgment on her credibility.Secretary de Lima assures the public Napoles’ testimony will be validated by other sources.She adds, it would be an “abdication” of her “duty as a truth-seeker” not to listen to Napoles.De Lima says “truth-seeking” will be the focus of the evaluation of the list of names Napoles implicated and the affidavit she submitted. Story 4: LACSON: ‘NOISY’ CRITICS ALSO GOT NAPOLES KICKBACKSFormer senator Panfilo Lacson says even critics of the pork barrel scam got kickbacks from Janet Napoles.In a radio interview Wednesday, Lacson says Napoles’ husband and children met with him in March before Justice Secretary de Lima met Napoles on Monday.Lacson says they wanted to ask for help in getting President Benigno Aquino and the Ombudsman to grant Napoles immunity.The Napoleses reportedly gave Lacson a draft affidavit, a narration of the scam, documentary proof and an audio recording of a “revealing” telephone conversation.Lacson says Napoles identified fewer than 19 senators, but the number was enough to ‘reach a quorum.’He also says Napoles mentioned more names not previously brought up, including those who staunchly criticized the scam.Lacson adds, it “seems” there is a lawmaker who earned more from the scam than Senators Bong Revilla, Jinggoy Estrada, and Juan Ponce Enrile, who now face plunder charges.

Everyday at sunset, street children gather here in Luneta Park. Jude Natividad has been going to the mobile classrooms for the last 10 years. He is now 17. JUDE NATIVIDAD, SCHOLAR, CHILDHOPE ASIA: Nung kinausap ako ng social worker, nahihiya ako. Ininvite niya ako papunta doon sa may kasama nung mga bata, hanggang sa marami akong nakilalang mga bata…Tapos, ayon, then the rest araw-araw na akong umaattend. Sinasali nila ako sa mga program nila. Hanggang sa na-improve yung skills ko. Halimbawa natin yung pagsalita sa harap ng mga tao. Dati ayaw na ayaw ko yun e. (When the social worker approached me, I was shy. They invited me to go to where the children were, until I got to know the other kids. Then there, I just attended everyday. They would let me join their programs until my skills improved. For example public speaking, I could never do that before.) Jude got a scholarship to finish high school in Japan, under the International School of Asia Karuizawa.Sadly, he had to decline the offer. Childhope Asia lacked the funding to process his papers after international donors pulled out. JUDE NATIVIDAD, SCHOLAR, CHILDHOPE ASIA: Gusto kong i-grab ito e, gustong gusto ko kaso hindi lang sa ako yung isa sa mga batang nabigyan ng pagkakataong makapunta sa ibang bansa dahil sa scholarship kaso yung pagkakataon na iyon, naputol e kasi nga dahil hindi nga kaya ng Child Hope na tustusan yung mga dapat na ibigay sa akin. Tapos, kulang talaga sa budget…Napanghinaan ako ng loob. (I wanted to grab it. I really wanted it because I get to study abroad, but the opportunity is gone now. Child hope could not shoulder the expenses for the things I needed. We didn’t have the budget. I felt really disappointed.) Childhope Asia founder, 83-year old Teresita Silva, dedicated her life helping street children like Jude.Silva says international donors scaled back financial support because the Philippine economy is doing well. The assumption is that a booming economy will create more opportunities for the poor. She says that’s not yet true for the Philippines. TERESITA SILVA, FOUNDER CHILDHOPE ASIA: The benefits of economic growth in the Philippines is not yet reaching the poorest of the poor. Street children are very much part of the poorest of the poor. They live on the streets, many of them are abandoned, some of them have families but they are dysfunctional families or urban poor. Everyday, Childhope Asia teaches lessons on sanitation, reproductive health, and their rights as a child. The organization provides temporary spaces where street children can feel safe and learn without fear of discrimination.But now the group is forced to scale down. CHIPS GUEVARRA, BOARD MEMBER, CHILDHOPE ASIA: As you know we have a street education program as you can see here at the back, but… We used to take care of 1,200 street kids. But because we’ve had to reduce our street educators, we have to pay them salary for them to be sustainable. We had to reduce it down so now we’re down to about 600, down to half that number. Jude dreams of finishing college and helping Child Hope Asia. JUDE NATIVIDAD, SCHOLAR, CHILDHOPE ASIA: Almost ten years na po ako sa Child Hope. Gustong gusto ko po tumulong sa Child Hope…Bilang pagtanaw ng utang na loob sa Child Hope, kasi hinding hindi ko po makakalimutan ang Child Hope. (I’ve been in Childhope for almost ten years. I really want to help Childhope. I want to give back after what they’ve given me, I will never forget Childhope.) GEN CRUZ, REPORTING: Childhope Asia is looking for ways to raise awareness for educating street children. But with limited resources, the NGO is struggling to stay afloat. For children like Jude, the future depends on how much longer Childhope Asia can remain financially viable. Gen Cruz.

Powered by their sharp attacks and solid defensive performance, Matin Varamin of Iran were able to wrest their second straight Asian Men’s Club Volleyball title, beating Al Rayyan of Qatar, 19-25 25-17, 26-24, 25-16 on Wednesday, April 16 at the Mall of Asia Arena. The West-Asian region successfully defended the crown club team Kallah Mazandaran won a year ago and successfully punched the continent’s lone ticket up for grabs for the World Club Volleyball Championship in Brazil on May. While only edging Qatar by 1, 43-42 in the attacks department, Iran used a big 18-9 gap in block points to claim the championship trophy. Shahram Mahmoudi top scored with 19 markers on 15 kills and 4 blocks. He was named Most Valuable Player, while Seyed Mousavi had 13 points on 7 blocks and Mostafa Sharifat also added 13 in the win. Al Rayyan opened a 22-17 edge in the opener with solid blocking upstairs and with smashing spikes coming from Cala Gerardo and Christian Savani. Ibrahim put an end to the first set with an emphatic quick hit to draw first blood. But the moment Qatar couldn’t convert on their attacks, they knew they would be in big trouble. Matin Varamin bombarded their opponents with attacks coming from all angles in the second set, opening an 18-11 advantage before equalizing at 25-17. Al Rayyan’s defense turned sour and were not able to stop Iran’s hard hits. In the third set, Al Rayyan almost had it in the books, racing towards a 19-13 bubble. But Iran’s stonewall defense eventually paved way for a robbery. Down 21-24, Iran’s solid coverage at the net prevented any point from the Qataris; a hit by Alireza Nasr Esfahani then another block by Seyed Mousavi allowed Iran to steal the set, 26-24. Al Rayyan’s frustrations took a toll as Yosleyder Cala Gerardo was slapped with a red card for misconduct, leading to a free point for Iran. The Iranians used this development to light up a 7-1 start in the fourth set. The tandem of Mostafa Sharifat and Shahram Mahmoudi then buried their foes even further, building a huge 22-13. From there it was all over for a struggling Qatar squad, who’ll settle for the silver once again. The title is Iran’s 10th gold medal and the 8th in 9 tournaments. They have won 16 medals overall in the Asian club championships. Christian Savani and Yosleyder Cala Gerardo paced the Qataris with 19 and 17 points, respectively. China takes bronze In the bronze medal match, Beijing BAIC Motors of China swept Kondensat-Kazakhstan to take home the 2nd runner-up trophy. Captain Wout Wijismans, who poured 15 points (11 hits, 3 aces) to lead four scorers in double-digits, said they have to be proud of the accomplishment because it is still something to take home. “We will bring back to China a bronze medal so we have to be satisfied.” The Chinese had a huge disparity in blocks (13-4) and spikes (38-29) to book an easy 25-17, 25-14, 25-20 victory.

The Heat, who rested both reigning NBA MVP LeBron James and centre Chris Bosh in their second to last game of the regular season, will be the number two seed when the postseason starts this weekend. The Heat allowed the Wizards to shoot an impressive 59 percent from the field and go 14-of-29 from three-point range.

IMF cuts global growth forecast to 3.6%","body":" Today on Rappler.   Story 1: PH GETS US AVIATION UPGRADEAfter 6 years, the Philippines regains its much-coveted rating upgrade from US aviation authorities.The US Federal Aviation Administration or FAA grants the Philippines a Category 1 rating for complying with safety standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization or ICAO.A Category 1 rating allows Philippine carriers to add flights to the United States.In a statement, Transport Secretary Jun Abaya praises the US agency’s move, saying it “cements a landmark era in the Philippine aviation sector.”The Philippines held a Category 1 rating until January 2008, when it was downgraded to Category 2 by the FAA. It prompted the European Union to blacklist Philippine carriers two years later.The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines worked to address safety concerns to regain its Category 1 status and get off the EU’s blacklist.In March 2013, the ICAO gave the Philippines a passing mark in its safety audit.The upgrade to Category 1 came after the EU lifted a ban on Philippine carriers in July 2013. Story 2: APPEAL SC RULING ON RH LAW, MIRIAM TELLS ADVOCATESSenator Miriam Santiago urges supporters to appeal the Supreme Court’s ruling on the Reproductive Health law.In a statement, Santiago says there’s a chance to convince the High Tribunal to declare as constitutional the 8 provisions it struck down.Santiago says, “I am fairly confident that a more exhaustive study of the principles of constitutional law will support a reconsideration of all 8 provisions.”On April 8, the Court declared the RH law constitutional, except for 8 provisions.RH law authors in the House of Representatives said the ruling does not diminish the law. In a TV interview, Senator Pia Cayetano said, “If one or two provisions would be stricken down, to me that’s acceptable, as long as the heart and the meat of the bill is still there. And it is, without a doubt.” Story 3: ARROYO’S STEM CELL DOCTOR CHARGED WITH ILLEGAL PRACTICEThe National Bureau of Investigation files a case against the stem cell physician of former president Gloria Arroyo for the illegal practice of medicine.Alternative medicine doctor Antonia Carandang-Park is charged for violating Republic Act 2382 or The Medical Act of 1959. The bureau’s investigation found that Park “misrepresented herself as a licensed physician [on] several occasions.”Park and some of her staff face charges of estafa and reckless imprudence resulting in homicide with the death of 23-year-old Kate Tan after undergoing stem cell treatment.Park supposedly signed an official statement in her diagnosis suggesting stem cell therapy for Arroyo, who suffers from debilitating neck and back pain.Park is also not in the Professional Regulatory Commission database of physicians as of August 2013.Park earlier told Rappler that she is an unlicensed physician in the Philippines, but said she is a registered medical practitioner in London and Korea.

Concepcion emphasizes the impact of hunger on productivity. KC CONCEPCION, WFP PHILIPPINES NATIONAL AMBASSADOR AGAINST HUNGER: There’s nothing you can do when you’re hungry.

In 2013, the Global Hunger Index ranks the Philippines the 28th hungriest country in the world.Concepcion says the problem lies in the lack of access to food resources. KC CONCEPCION, WFP PHILIPPINES NATIONAL AMBASSADOR AGAINST HUNGER: The biggest issue for us is really purchasing power, not being able to have access to the same food resources. We don’t know, a lot of people that I talked to are shocked to find out that there might be an issue of hunger in the Philippines kasi ang hihilig natin kumain. We’re an agricultural country, we have oceans and the seas surrounding the country so why should there be a lack of resources? And that’s exactly the point, there’s enough food in the whole world, to feed the whole population of the world. So it’s more about equal distribution of food and being able to have access to that food.

But then mom… she specifically said that to me, ‘well, if you’re really a woman. If you really want to be a woman, and fully be recognized as a woman, there’s a law in the United States that would allow you to be a woman and changed your gender marker. Soon after coming out, she founded “Gender Proud.” GEENA ROCERO, FIL-AM MODEL: Gender proud is a campaign that’s raising awareness to transgender people all over the world. But at the core of gender proud, we’re trying to create a global, unified messaging, why it’s important for countries all over the world, to adapt new policy on gender recognition law. We are all assigned a gender at birth, but sometimes that gender just doesn’t match, so people should be allowed to self identify, whether you want to transition from male to female. Female to Male or gender variant.

The third was not identified.The two allegedly received checks from one of the corporate bank accounts of state firm National Agribusiness Corporation or Nabcor.Tulfo and Magdurulang allegedly received checks worth more than P245,000 each.Nabcor was used as a conduit of pork barrel-funded projects under fake NGOs run by alleged pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Lim Napoles.De Lima says the department will evaluate the sworn statements of the Nabcor whistleblowers.Senator Chiz Escudero also says the Senate blue ribbon committee should invite the media members to a hearing. Story 2: CHINA POSTURING TO SEIZE AYUNGIN – GOLEZFormer National Security Adviser Roilo Golez says he’s convinced China is posturing to seize Ayungin Shoal and Recto Bank, areas located within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.He says this puts the Philippine Marine detachment there in “grave jeopardy.”In a statement posted on his blog, Golez claims China aims to seize the Recto Bank off Palawan.China demands that the Philippines remove from Ayungin the grounded ship which serves as a detachment for the Philippine Marines. Chinese coast guard members recently blocked navy-commissioned civilian ships that were going to bring food and water to troops stationed in Ayungin.

Story 4: MILLIONS TO REMAIN IN POVERTY AS GOV’T REVISES TARGETThe government on Tuesday revises its target to reduce poverty by 2016. The Philippines originally projected that 16.6% of its 100 million people would still be living in poverty by 2016. But Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan says the new target will be 18% to 20% of the population.Despite remarkable economic growth under the Aquino administration the poverty rate remained at around 25% since 2003. Balisacan says the revised target takes into consideration the setbacks last year due to the wide-scale destruction from natural disasters. Story 5: PH URGED TO RATIFY AMENDMENT VS HAZARDOUS WASTE TRADEWill the Philippines become the dumping ground for toxic garbage generated by richer nations? If the government does not ratify the Basel Ban Amendment, it may just happen.In June to August 2013 alone, 50 container vans holding household waste from Canada were exported to the Philippines. Customs officials reveal the vans contain dirty plastics, and household garbage including adult diapers. Placed in the port of Manila, the unclaimed vans started to leak. The Basel Ban Amendment will ensure incidents like this are less likely to happen. The amendment prohibits developed nations from exporting hazardous wastes to developing nations.Netizens weigh in favor of the Basel Ban Amendment but say it’s unlikely government will act soon.Joseph Tamayo says, “I just hope the legislators can do something real, not just plans, theories, lip work or propaganda. Mother Earth has been crying for help a long time ago.”Angelica Pettersson holds a more pessimistic view, saying, “Don’t hold your breath. The legislative branch is busy passing bills that establish our national vegetable,while busily proposing ones that declare the national viand and the banning of Korean telenovelas.” Story 6: 20 FILIPINOS ARRESTED IN SPAIN DRUG BUSTSpanish police arrest 42 people, including 20 Filipinos, in drug raids across Madrid, Barcelona and Murcia.Police say they broke up two drug trafficking rings specializing in crystal meth, seizing 8 kilos of the highly addictive drug and 15,000 euros or 21,000 dollars in cash.Crystal meth is fairly common in North America and Asia, but has only started to appear in Spain over the last year.Police say one of the two gangs used a car import-export business as a front company to give the appearance their frequent trips around Spain, Italy and Africa were legal.The police add, their recent raids target those suspected of smuggling drugs into Spain.

The website shared webcam-captured videos of juvenile boys forced to produce sexually explicit material.

The treaty signing was conducted at lightning speed in the Kremlin in a defiant expansion of Russia’s post-Soviet borders that has plunged relations with the West to a new post-Cold War low. The move, less than 3 weeks after pro-Moscow troops first seized control of the strategic peninsula, triggered furious condemnation from Western leaders. Ukraine said one of its soldiers had been killed in Crimea on Tuesday, branding the first confirmed fatality on the peninsula a “war crime”, and announced that its forces would be allowed to fire weapons in self defence. At the same time the pro-Kremlin authorities reported that a member of their own forces had also been killed in the incident. Interim Ukraine President Oleksandr Turchynov accused the country’s former masters in Moscow of acting like “Nazi Germany” as his prime minister declared the conflict with Russia was now at a “military stage”. The West, which backs the new leaders in Kiev who took power after last month’s ousting of pro-Kremlin president Viktor Yanukovych, condemned Moscow’s actions as a blatant annexation of Crimea. US Vice President Joe Biden bluntly accused Russia of a “land grab” and Secretary of State John Kerry warned Moscow against any incursion into eastern Ukraine. Putin signed the treaty with Crimean prime minister Sergei Aksyonov after more than 97% of Crimeans voted in favour of joining Russia in a disputed referendum on Sunday. Russian lawmakers, who still have to ratify the treaty although it comes into force immediately, broke into raucous applause after the signing. “The Republic of Crimea is considered to be part of Russia from the date of the signing of the treaty,” the Kremlin said. Crimea and the city of Sevastopol – the home of the Russian Black Sea fleet which has special status — are being incorporated as new constituent parts of the Russian Federation. ‘Inseparable part of Russia’ The signing came after Putin gave a fiery address seeking to justify the incorporation of Crimea into Russia, and brushing off US and EU sanctions touted as the most severe against Moscow since the end of Cold War. “In the hearts and minds of people, Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of Russia,” Putin said. (READ: Parties and gunfire in separatist Crimea) Putin slammed the Soviet-era decision by Nikita Khrushchev to gift the peninsula to the Ukrainian Soviet republic as riddled with “violations.” “When Crimea suddenly ended up being in another state, Russia felt it was not simply robbed – it was plundered,” he said. He said Russia was tired of being pushed into a corner and that it had been repeatedly deceived by the West. “On Ukraine the West crossed a line,” he said, warning it against provoking Russia. But he sought to play down fears that Russia was seeking to grab parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, whose Russian-speaking population is far from supportive of the new authorities in Ukraine. “We don’t want the break-up of Ukraine. We do not need it,” Putin said. It is the first time since World War II that Moscow has expanded its borders and represents the most radical redrawing of the map of Europe since Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia. The move has been immensely popular among Russians and over 100,000 people turned out for a patriotic rally attended by Putin outside the Kremlin late Tuesday. ‘First Ukraine casualty’ NATO secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he was “deeply concerned” by reports of the death of a Ukrainian soldier. “It is urgent that all sides show restraint and take all possible steps to avoid further escalation,” he added. A regional Ukrainian defense ministry spokesman told the Agence France-Presse the soldier had died after being shot in the neck when a group of gunmen stormed and took control of a Ukrainian military base in Simferopol. But the pro-Kremlin police blamed both that death and the killing of the pro-Russian militia member on unknown assailants. Thousands of Ukrainian troops have been left marooned in bases in Crimea and it remains unclear how their fate will be resolved with the region now under full Russian control. Turchynov said Putin was following the example of 20th century fascist leaders. “Russia is playing a dirty game to annex Crimea. World War II began with the annexation by Nazi Germany of other countries’ territories,” the president said. Sanctions, isolation loom Western leaders warned a tougher response to the annexation of Crimea could still yet come. “Russia’s political and economic isolation will only increase if it continues down this path and it will in fact see additional sanctions by the United States and the EU,” Biden said during a visit to Warsaw. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, seen as the most important potential powerbroker in the crisis, said Russia was guilty of repeatedly breaking international law. With Russia already risking expulsion from the G8 group of top nations, US President Barack Obama called for a G7 summit next week in The Hague to discuss the escalating East-West showdown. Diplomats in Brussels said EU and Ukrainian leaders would on Friday sign the political portion of a landmark pact whose rejection by Yanukovych in November sparked the protests that led to his fall. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/51770-nba-contract-buyout-danny-granger/","title":"NBA: Contract buyout puts Danny Granger up for grabs","date":"Feb 28, 2014 2:55 AM PHT","snippet":"Danny Granger has agreed to contract buyout terms with the Philadelphia 76ers that would make the forward a possible wildcard for NBA clubs looking for talent ahead of the playoffs.","body":" PHILADELPHIA – Danny Granger has agreed to contract buyout terms with the Philadelphia 76ers that would make the forward a possible wildcard for NBA clubs looking for talent ahead of the playoffs. The 30-year-old American forward, in the final year of a five-year deal worth $60 million, was traded last week from Indiana, which boasts the NBA’s best record, to the 76ers. With the buyout deal and no team likely to pick up his contract, Granger should become eligible to sign with a team for a lesser amount, giving him the chance to join a title contender.

The Philippine Taekwondo Association (PTA) will be sending six male and six female jins to the 17th edition of the Asiad set from September 19 to October 4 in Incheon, South Korea. Three of the 12 slots on the team are reserved for Kristie Elaine Alora, Jade Zafra and Kristopher Robert Uy won gold in their respective weight divisions in last year’s 27th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Myanmar The PTA had evaluated the performances of the 20 aspirants, 10 male and 10 female, from the national training pool using the Carlos J.

The PTA had already submitted the names of the 20 jins to the PTA board, which is expected to release the names in the next two weeks. The 12-member Philippine national taekwondo team will go through extensive training overseas and will see action in various international tournaments. Alora copped the women’s welterweight (+73 kilograms) golf, Zafra ruled the featherweight division (57kg) and Uy topped the men’s welterweight (80kg) class. PTA national training director Noel Veneracion said the three jins easily passed the criteria set by the joint Philippine Olympic Committee-Philippine Sports Commission Asian Games Task Force in all subjective sports where an individual or team needs to crack the top five in any regional tournament.  “Undoubtedly, [Alora, Zafra and Uy] are the best fighters under the national training pool,” said Veneracion. “Their gold medal victories against a tough field in the [2013] SEA Games attest to that,” added national coach Dindo Simpao. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/50026-first-winter-olympics-medals-up-for-grabs-after-dazzling-opening/","title":"First Winter Olympics medals up for grabs after dazzling opening","date":"Feb 8, 2014 4:29 PM PHT","snippet":"Olympic athletes were competing for the first medals of the Sochi Winter Games on Saturday after Russia staged a thrilling opening ceremony that impressed even foreign skeptics.","body":" SOCHI, Russia – Olympic athletes were competing for the first medals of the Sochi Winter Games on Saturday after Russia staged a thrilling opening ceremony that impressed even foreign skeptics. President Vladimir Putin late Friday declared open the 22nd Winter Olympics in a ceremony that took 40,000 people packed into the Fisht stadium and TV viewers around the world on a lightning tour through Russian history. Thousands of fireworks exploded above the venue on the Black Sea coast during a ceremony that won gushing global praise despite an early glitch when one of the Olympic rings failed to appear. “We missed this for so many years… a pride for our country, a feeling for her power, unity and greatness. Yesterday, we felt it,” the Moskovsky Komsomolets daily said. After a build-up dogged by controversies on issues ranging from Russia’s gay rights record to security, the successful ceremony took some pressure off the organizers, who have been under unprecedented scrutiny. In Games that are among the most politically charged of recent times, the focus moves to the sporting action Saturday at sea-level and in the mountains above Sochi. Five gold medals are up for grabs. The first gold will likely come in the women’s cross-country skiathlon, while Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjoerndalen, 40, will become the joint highest medal winner in Winter Olympics history if he makes the podium in the sprint. Women will seek gold in the spectacular moguls freestyle event, the men’s snowboard slopestyle will be decided after a succession of spectacular crashes while the endurance kings of speed skating will face off in the lung-busting men’s 5,000 meters.  ‘We want to break stereotypes’ The high-octane ceremony, devised by the powerful boss of Russia’s Channel One television Konstantin Ernst, got off to a rocky start when one of five illuminated artificial snowflakes that were supposed to morph into the Olympic rings failed to open, leaving just four rings. But organizers brushed off the mishap, admitting that they covered up the glitch on Russian state television by quickly inserting footage of the segment they had recorded days earlier. The unflappable Ernst drew on Buddhist philosophy. “There is a saying that you have to kick out the uneven part of a perfectly polished ball to understand how perfect it is,” he said. Thereafter the show charmed and stunned in equal measure, taking viewers on a lightning tour through Russian history and culture guided by a young girl named Lyubov (Love). “We want to break stereotypes and show the world the new Russia,” said the head of the Sochi organizing committee, Dmitry Chernyshenko. The Russian team won huge cheers as they entered to the song “Nas Ne Dogonyat” (“Not Gonna Get Us”) by female pop duo Tatu, known for their raunchy lesbian-tinged pop videos. In a nod towards Russia’s proud sporting past, the Olympic cauldron was lit by two triple gold-winning Soviet winter sports icons — figure skater Irina Rodnina and ice hockey legend Vladislav Tretyak. The flame had been brought into the stadium by US-based Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova and the final relay included Olympic rhythmic gymnastics champion Alina Kabayeva, who has been rumored in some quarters to be Putin’s lover. Even the foreign press, which have been hugely critical of Russia in the days up to the Games, heaped praised on the ceremony. “For Russia last night it marked its revival as a post-Soviet powerhouse, confident of its seat at the top table after two decades of doubt and despondency,” Britain’s Daily Mail wrote. ‘Keep politics out of Olympics’ Putin, who spearheaded the successful bid in 2007, welcomed more than 40 other heads of state and leaders for the ceremony, including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and embattled Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. However, US President Barack Obama as well as the leaders of key EU states Britain, France, and Germany were conspicuous by their absence, a move seen by many as a snub over Russia’s now notorious anti-gay law. But IOC President Thomas Bach made an impassioned call for politics to stay out of sport, saying “have the courage to address your disagreements in political dialogue and not on the back of your athletes”. The security concerns that have shadowed these Games were underlined when a Ukrainian man attempted to hijack an airliner en route from Ukraine to Turkey and divert it to Sochi. But Turkish military jets forced the plane to land in Istanbul, where security teams overpowered the man, said to be drunk. The United States has already announced a temporary ban on liquids and gels in hand luggage on Russia-bound flights, following a warning that militants could stuff explosives into toothpaste. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/48248-ginebra-slams-globalport-to-grab-no-1-spot/","title":"Ginebra slams Globalport to grab No. 1 spot","date":"Jan 17, 2014 8:08 PM PHT","snippet":"Slaughter fires a career high 23 points with 13 rebounds as Ginebra secures top spot with win over GlobalPort","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Brgy. Ginebra San Miguel bagged the top spot in the PLDT Home DSL PBA Philippine Cup after a hard-fought 108-92 victory over Globalport Batang Pier on Friday, January 17 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. The league’s frontrunners capitalized on Globalport’s depleted frontline right from the start, going to Japeth Aguilar underneath. The athletic forward scored12 points in the first quarter alone, putting Globalport big men Kelly Nabong and Jondan Salvador into early foul trouble. The Batang Pier however, made sure it won’t be a walk in the park even without the presence of injured Jay Washington. Realizing they can’t get things done from the inside, guards Sol Mercado and Terrence Romeo led a run in the second quarter, combining for 18 second quarter points to help Globalport pull within 40-42. Ginebra then opened the third canto on a 9-2 run highlighted by an Aguilar tomahawk jam, to push the lead up to 67-51. Free throws by Greg Slaughter further widened the gap to Ginebra’s biggest at 77-60. But the Batang Pier just won’t surrender. Led by Romeo and reserve big man Jewel Ponferrada, Globalport used a spirited 13-2 rally to trim the gap to just six at 73-79 in the closing moments of the third quarter. From there, both squads traded baskets, but it was Ginebra who got the better of the duel, controlling the match in the final frame. The twin-tower duo of Aguilar and Slaughter took over in the final 12 minutes as Ginebra outscored Globalport, 28-19 in the fourth to march towards their 11th win in 13 outings. Slaughter, the no. 1 overall pick in the PBA draft, finished with a career-high 23 points and added 13 rebounds. Aguilar had 21 markers and 8 boards, while LA Tenorio dished out 11 assists to go with his 10 points in the win. Eric Menk played his best game in a Globalport uniform, carrying the fight for the crestfallen squad with 17 points and 16 rebounds against his former team. Jewel Ponferrada added 16 for the Batang Pier, who dropped to 5-9 in the team standings. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/47872-january-13-2014-pulseasia-aquino-binay-drilon-belmonte-sereno-bangkok-shutdown-mindanao-landslide/","title":"Rappler Newscast | January 13, 2014","date":"Jan 13, 2014 10:21 PM PHT","snippet":"“More pronounced” disapproval ratings for Drilon, Belmonte and Sereno in new survey.

It is simply a service that demands a wider view and a bigger heart.”The new Filipino cardinal faced controversy in 2011, when critics tagged him and 6 other bishops as recipients of expensive vehicles from the government for personal use.Quevedo denies the accusation, but admits to having requested a vehicle from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office “to be used by their social action program.” Story 4: THAI OPPOSITION PROTESTERS LAUNCH BANGKOK ‘SHUTDOWN’Thousands of opposition protesters occupy major streets in central Bangkok Monday in an attempted “shutdown” of the capital, stepping up their campaign to overthrow Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.Thousands of flag-waving protesters gather at key intersections in the city, forcing many to leave their cars at home and take public transport instead.Police say several hospitals, hotels, schools and fire stations are affected by the shutdown.The protests are triggered by a failed amnesty bill that could have allowed former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra to return from self-exile without going to jail for corruption charges.The protesters say they want to rid Thailand of the “Thaksin regime.”Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban says the rallies are a “people’s revolution.”The government has not tried to stop the protesters taking over parts of the city, but authorities say they are ready to declare a state of emergency if violence breaks out.

Here. [Oh my gosh it is heavy!] In designing this, the designer Susan Hilferty wanted to connect Glinda very much to the sky and the stars and rainbows. So all of Glinda’s stuff looks lightweight and it’s frilly and it’s full of layers. Elphaba on the other hand, the Wicked Witch, is heavier and darker and she’s very connected to the earth. Okay the quick change out of this (bubble dress) into her uniform is about 15-16 seconds. [15 seconds to get out of this dress?] 15 seconds to get out of it and into another costume entirely with a wig change at the same time. So we’re here with Kelly Ritchie, head of hair and makeup. And you have about 70 wigs in the show? KELLY RITCHIE, ‘WICKED’ HEAD OF HAIR & MAKEUP: That go onstage every night, yes. These wigs are individually hand knotted and made to fit the performers actual hairline and head and they take 18-40 hours to make one wig. We have a pancake makeup from MAC with landscape green and we have these awesomely huge brushes. We put water in there. The secret is getting the right consistency water to product ratio which can take a little time when you’re learning to do it. So we whip it onto the skin. We have a base, a foundation base underneath as well so it doesn’t grab on too much on the performers skin. [And they can sweat through this?] There are times, their fingertips will come off and rub a bit so then we reapply in interval. [So Kelly tell us, how long does the makeup process take for Elphaba, from start to finish?] From start to finish, it can take about 25 mins to 45.

News of Subido’s death filtered through the Universities Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) track meet at La Salle Dasmariñas Saturday morning, December 7. Henry Subido, PE director of Lourdes Mandaluyong, said in a text message, his father had emphysema and prostrate cancer. Subido died on his birthday and close to the 40th anniversary of the first Asian track and field championships at the Rodriguez Sports Stadium in Marikina where he was national coach. His remains will be cremated on December 13 at Glendale Forest Lawn, his granddaughter Kimmy Armas posted on her Facebook page. The Philippines won 4 gold medals in Marikina through Amelita Alanes Saberon in the 100, the late Abdulkadir Guiapar in the 400m hurdles, Josephine de la Vina in the discus and the women’s 4×400 meter relay. Subido’s coolness in passing the baton to anchor Enrique Bautista kept the Philippine chances alive in the 4×100-meter relay team in the 1958 Asian Games. As the Japanese anchor grabbed the lead, Subido slowed down before passing the baton to Bautista. Bautista ran like a tiger chasing his prey to nose out the Japanese sprinter at the finish. But as a coach, Subido was tough. He would utter his trademark grunt when he wanted things done and his practice sessions were severe. Some star athletes did not survive his system which included weight training sessions. He would say the ones who lasted through his sessions and won medals abroad were the real stars. “He was a good friend and teammate but really strict with his teammates, which to me, was okay,” said Claro Pellosis, chief referee of the UAAP track meet, and a former national teammate. Pellosis and Asian Games 100m bronze medalist Roger Onofre are the only remaining members of that relay squad which won again in the 1962 Asian Games without Bautista and Subido. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/44965-azkals-new-fifa-ranking-high-133/","title":"Azkals grab highest FIFA ranking at 133","date":"Dec 1, 2013 10:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Despite 2 losses in their recent friendlies, the Azkals reach another record high in the FIFA Rankings","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Despite coming out winless in their last two friendlies, the Philippine National Football Team reached another record high in the FIFA Rankings, placing 133rd in the November 28 update.

From easing visa restrictions to building on recent currency cooperation and winning Beijing money for investment in British nuclear power plants, Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborne can claim to have smoothed relations with the emerging economic power. (READ: China powers ahead, posts 7.8% growth in Q3) He in part managed to win over a Chinese government that had rebuffed Britain after Prime Minister David Cameron met Dalai Lama — the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet — in 2012. The chancellor’s trip coincided with one made to China by London Mayor Boris Johnson — with the pair seen as potential rivals for the leadership of the Conservative party should Cameron come unstuck before or after the next general election in 2015. In a speech at Peking University, Osborne insisted “there is no country in the West more open to investment — especially from China” than Britain. He said: “I don’t want Britain to resent China’s success, I want us to celebrate it. I don’t want us to try to resist your economic progress, I want Britain to share in it.” Nuclear investment Osborne on Thursday, October 17, said he would allow Chinese companies to take majority stakes in nuclear power projects across Britain. (READ: Hard road to world domination for Chinese firms) The British government said the initial Chinese stakes in nuclear power stations were likely to be minority shares, but added: “Over time stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes.” The announcement comes amid reports that China General Nuclear Power and French energy giant EDF have agreed a controversial deal to build a new atomic power station at Hinkley Point, southwest England. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight consultancy, said the nuclear tie-up made sense for Britain’s indebted economy. “With the government strapped for cash, there are obvious major attractions in attracting Chinese investment into projects such as the building of the Hinkley Point nuclear station,” Archer told AFP. “It is plainly evident that China will become ever more important as a potential market for UK firms,” he added. Also last week, Beijing Construction Engineering Group signed a deal with British firms to develop a business district around Manchester airport. The development of Britain’s third busiest airport — described as one of the largest construction projects in Britain since the 2012 London Olympics — will cost £800 million (US$1.30 billion, 947 million euros). Britain loosens visa restrictions Osborne used his trip also to announce plans to make it easier for China’s citizens to obtain British visas, as it seeks a bigger share of the multi-billion-dollar Chinese traveller market in the face of stiff European competition. Chinese tourists visiting the European Union using selected travel agencies will no longer have to file a separate application to visit Britain, which is not part of the EU’s “Schengen Area” for border-free travel. Business travellers will be able to apply for a “super-priority” visa, which will be processed within 24 hours rather than a week. Some 210,000 visas were issued to Chinese nationals in 2012, adding around £300 million to the British economy as designer label-hungry Chinese shoppers snapped up goods. Plans enabling Britons to invest up to 80 billion yuan ($13.1 billion) in China’s heavily restricted capital markets — with the aim of making London a major trading hub for China’s currency — also emerged during Osborne’s trip. In June, the Chinese and British central banks signed a currency-swap deal with a maximum value of 200 billion yuan to promote bilateral trade and investment as well as the use of the yuan in global trade and finance. “A great nation like China should have a great global currency,” Osborne said, adding: “More trade and more investment, means more business and more jobs for Britain.” Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading group Forex.com, told AFP that the latest announcement was “mostly symbolic” owing to the relatively small amount of investment agreed. However, she added: “It is a step in the right direction as it is further developing Britain’s relationship with China and the timing is expedient as China may be looking for a partner to diversify out of the US and avoid their political troubles.” China on Thursday welcomed the resolution of the US debt ceiling deadlock, saying it will contribute to global economic stability, but Beijing’s official news agency poured scorn on US politicians. China meanwhile has the world’s largest foreign exchange reserves, most of them held in dollars, and is the largest foreign holder of US Treasury bills with $1.28 trillion, according to the latest available figures from Washington. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/39967-roundup-fiba-asia-u16-championship-day-1/","title":"Roundup: FIBA Asia U16 Championship Day 1","date":"Sep 26, 2013 10:14 PM PHT","snippet":"A roundup of games in Day 1 of the 2013 FIBA Asia U16 Championship.","body":" MANILA, Philippines — The 2013 FIBA Asia U16 Championships in Tehran, Iran opened Wednesday, September 25 with most games being blowouts. The traditional powerhouses prevailed, with the India-Jordan game the lone nail-biter. In the first game of the day, Jordan came back from 18 points down in the second half to force overtime and scrape past India, 100-97. 6’7″ Khaled Abu Aboud led the way for the WABA squad with 24 points, 15 rebounds, 4 steals, and 4 blocks, while Mohammad Daher backstopped him with 21 points. Mahipal Singh and Ashish Briggs combined for 46 points to lead India, while Vishal Gupta collared 20 rebounds in the losing effort. Jordan takes on Japan today, while India takes a break to reflect on how they let this game go. The second game of the day featured Chinese-Taipei drubbing Kazakhstan, 109-82. Pint-sized guard Tu Su-Han led the Taiwanese with 26 points, 6 assists, and 3 steals, while 6’2″ swingman Sung Yung-Cheng had 16 points, 9 rebounds, and 2 steals. Taiwan didn’t run into a lot of trouble here as they controlled the boards and forced 34 Kazakh turnovers. The losing side was led by the 22 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 steals of Leonid Voronushkin, while compatriot Alexandr Danilchenko added 18 points and 17 boards. TPE takes a break today, while the Kazakhs take on SEABA champion, Team Philippines. The third game saw how the Junior Taeguk Warriors drub the Thais, 118-65. The inside-outside duo of Park Sang-Kwon and Kwon Hyeok-Joon was just unstoppable for coach Kim Do-Wan. The 6’5″ Park scored 19 points, grabbed 8 rebounds, and had 4 steals, while team captain Kwon registered 18 markers, 7 assists, 6 rebounds, and 6 steals. The Koreans are expected to do really well in this tournament, and this start should underscore their deep pool of talent. The Thais, meanwhile, were paced by the 11 markers in 15 minutes of Numjan Sittiporn. Thailand faces fellow SEABA side Malaysia today, while the Koreans face WABA powerhouse Iran. In the opening day’s fourth game, China met expectations by quashing Syria, 95-61. The parade of young giants continues for the Big Red Machine, as 6’10″ 16-year old Hu Jinqiu led the way with 22 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 blocked shots. He was ably supported by team captain Xu Mingzhi, who netted 13 markers, 7 boards, and 4 thefts. 6’9″ 15-year old Yuan Zheliang also impressed with a dozen points on top of 14 boards in under 17 minutes. Embattled Syria’s charge was spearheaded by playmaker Ronaldo Shammas’s 20 points on the strength of 4 triples. Ironically, the 5’7 guard also led Syria in rebounding with 8 caroms. China looks to win again by palying Hong Kong today, while Syria hopes to bounce back against Bahrain. In game number five, Iran had no problems trampling all over Malaysia, 104-68, with Behrooz Razeghin, Soheil Farhadi, and Ali Naziri each scoring at least 19 points. Razeghin led the way with 26 points and 4 treys, team captain Farhadi followed him up with 19 markers, while 6’8 Naziri contributed 22 points, 12 rebounds, and 2 rejections. The hapless Malaysians trailed for the whole game, with Yek Liang Chuan and Tan Wei Jie combining for 35 points to lead the team’s scorers. The Malaysians can break into the win column by beating the Thais today, while Iran should be tested by the Koreans. For the final match, Bahrain managed to pull away in the second half to win comfortably over Hong Kong, 85-60. Sadiq Hasan topped all scorers with 22 points to go along with a mammoth 21 rebounds, while 6’4 Mohamed Juma added 13 markers and 22 boards. They also paired up for 5 blocks. Needless to say, the Gulf side dominated the battle of the boards, 73-47, while also forcing 10 more HKG turnovers. Hong Kong was paced by the 17 points and 5 treys of On Ka Chung.

Revealed by The New York Times, The Hemisphere Project is reportedly a cooperative between local and federal drug officials and telecommuncations giant AT&T. According to the report, the US government “pays AT&T to place its employees in drug-fighting units around the country.” The employees help Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents and local detectives, providing them with phone data from 1987 onwards – 26 years of records. The program began in 2007, according to the presentation revealed by the New York Times. Hemisphere covers every call passing through an AT&T switch, whether it was made by an AT&T customer or not. The slides says 4 billion call records get put into the database every day, with some calls getting more than one call record. The New York Times got the slides from Drew Hendricks, a peace activist from Port Hadlock, Washington. According to the New York Times report, Hendricks received the powerpoint presentation, which was unclassified but marked “Law enforcement sensitive,” after sending out public information requests to West Coast police agencies. While the Obama administration acknowledged Hemisphere, it was noted that the phone data isn’t stored by the government. Rather, AT&T stores the phone data, which is then queried using administrative subpoenas, which are subpoenas issued by a federal agency rather than a judge or grand jury. The report also noted that “Mark A. Siegel, a spokesman for AT&T, declined to answer more than a dozen detailed questions, including ones about what percentage of phone calls made in the United States were covered by Hemisphere, the size of the Hemisphere database, whether the AT&T employees working on Hemisphere had security clearances and whether the company has conducted any legal review of the program.” Siegel responded via email that while AT&T could not “comment on any particular matter, we, like all other companies, must respond to valid subpoenas issued by law enforcement.” The slides do note some good that has been done, citing some arrests made using data acquired from Hemisphere. This includes a 2011 case where law enforcement officials stopped drug dealers who were rotating prepaid phones. This led to the seizure of 136 kilos of cocaine and US$2.2 million. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/pageants/37380-grab-taxi-app-review/","title":"GrabTaxi app: Answer to commuter woes","date":"Aug 27, 2013 3:00 PM PHT","snippet":"We put the taxi-finding app to the test in the mean streets of Metro Manila","body":" MANILA, Philippines – I was both pleased and annoyed. It was 9:30 in the morning and, from my bedroom, I could hear the familiar sound of knuckles on our iron front gate. A second later, the voice of our house assistant rang through the house as she called out my name. The cab I requested via GrabTaxi had arrived — more than 30 minutes early.  GrabTaxi, a new smartphone application that seeks to help commuters find cabs and cab drivers find passengers, was launched recently. I decided to take the app out for spin in the streets of Metro Manila.  READ: Need a cab? There’s an app for that! According to CEO and founder Anthony Tan, aside from helping people find a cab, GrabTaxi is also supposed to eliminate the all-too familiar commuter predicament of cab drivers turning down passengers, haggling over the fare and — of course — the constant worrying over the safety of the cab and its driver.  Through the app [available on both Android and iOS], passengers’ taxi bookings are blasted out to drivers within a 3 kilometer radius. Through smartphones used as dispatch tools, the taxis in the area are alerted of your request and can bid for the job. Once matched, both the driver and the passenger are given direct contacts to each other for better communication.  I used GrabTaxi twice in the course of two days: first in the evening, and the second instance in the next morning.  Here’s how it went: The app My first booking was on a Wednesday evening. I was coming from a cocktail party in one of the establishments along Bonifacio High Street in Taguig City. It had been a long night and the party just happened to revolve around different types of alcoholic beverages. Suffice to say I was intoxicated, dazed and a bit drowsy.   I opened the GrabTaxi app and it immediately determined my location with a dot on the map. In the first box, I indicated my exact location. In the second box I put in my home address. Within seconds, the app identified more than 10 cabs within a 3 kilometer radius of where I was. A few seconds later, a notice came up indicating a cab was already on its way to fetch me.  All the driver’s details were displayed on the screen: his name, mobile number, the car’s license plate number and a countdown of how many minutes it would take him to get where I was standing. If I looked closer, I would have actually seen him inch closer and closer to where I was standing on the map. For a first-time user, it was such a treat to stare at a moving taxi icon on the screen. I had a feeling the novelty was not going to wear off anytime soon. Punctuality It was 11:15pm. Based on the GPS tracking, my cab was less than a kilometer away. The app indicated that it would take him 5 minutes to arrive. A few seconds later, it said 4 minutes. It started to count down and then went back to 5 minutes. On the GPS, I could see he had gotten stuck somewhere in the Market! Market! area. 15 minutes later, at 11:30pm, Felipe Capion of Ultimax Transport pulled over in front of the curb where I was standing.  My second GrabTaxi driver the next morning was a little bit too excited. He was Jophel Calipayan of 24/7 Taxi Service. I had expected him to arrive at 10am, but at 9:30am he was already parked in front of our house, ready to go. Our destination was Taguig [again].  On the road We were headed to the South on a weekday morning. Taking EDSA was not an option. I asked Jophel to take C5 road instead. He agreed with my plan after asking for directions on how to get out of our village. At this point, the meter was still at P0. It was only after I sat down and closed the door that the driver started the meter with a P40 flat rate.  The cab was clean, had no suspicious stains on the upholstery and smelled of pine air freshener bought from the gas station. On both cabs, attached to the windshield was a mobile phone mount; in it sat a Cloud smartphone which was running the GrabTaxi app.  On the window of the right passenger seat was a printed, laminated brochure from GrabTaxi explaining how to download and use the application.  (Download Grab Taxi app for Android and iOS)  In the course of our journey along C5 that morning, my driver was in the perfect mood. He had an album of the Bee Gees playing in the background. As Robin Gibb sang, asking the perennial question of how to mend a broken heart, my driver used his turn signals properly, giving way to pedestrians and following traffic lights. My only gripe was that he wasn’t wearing his seatbelt. We spent the next 30 minutes talking about the app and how it has made finding passengers easier for him.  Felipe, on the other hand [from the night before], was not a chatty cabbie. However, being as it was close to midnight, I understood. I asked him why it took him 15 minutes to get to me. He said there was a slight vehicular accident around the mall area that stalled him a bit. After clicking in his seatbelt and punching a button on the meter to get it started, we were off into the night.  During the trip, passengers have the option of posting a message on Facebook or Twitter through the app. The message contains the car’s license number together with a link to the GrabTaxi website which allows your friends to follow your journey in real time. It’s an ingenious feature for those who make it a habit of texting people their cab license plate to a loved one. The GPS tracking makes it even better. However, I was in no mood to declare to the rest of the world where I was, and found no reason to suspect my driver was taking me somewhere else.  I arrived home some 20 minutes later. I paid the meter charge along with the additional P70 fee, and gave him a little extra considering the time.  Feedback Both my experiences were very successful. In the course of my morning ride with Jophen, though, he told me of an instance of double-booking: he arrived at the passenger’s home only to find out that another taxi, also affiliated with GrabTaxi, arrived earlier than him and picked the passenger up leaving him wondering what happened.  For most concerns, GrabTaxi has several lines of communication to receive passengers’ feedback. At the end of your journey, there’s an option in the app for you to send your feedback. Or at your own time, you can send them a tweet [@GrabTaxiPH], a message on Facebook [Facebook.com/GrabTaxiPH], or an e-mail [passenger.mnl@grabtaxi.com]. GrabTaxi is an app long overdue. In a place as chaotic, crowded and unpredictable like Metro Manila, it’s a concrete step towards creating a more organized, systematic and efficient way of riding public transportation — even if it is an air-conditioned cab. One can only hope that more fleets in the city [and, perhaps, the rest of the country] will recognize the benefits of using the application, for both passengers and drivers. Now if I could only pay for my fare with a credit card. – Rappler.com     Peter Imbong is a fulltime freelance writer, sometimes a stylist; and on some strange nights, a host.

Our team is on the brink of settling old scores, breaking curses and making history. Gilas Pilipinas has had many ups and downs in the tournament. They were scorching hot against Japan, but they played below their abilities against Hong Kong. We saw guys like Japeth Aguilar step up big time and witnessed how Gary David struggled game after game. Still, the inconsistencies notwithstanding, I feel good about our chances. We got the match-up we wanted, and should we prevail, both Korea and Qatar are also better match-ups compared to the colossi of China and Iran. Of course, that doesn’t mean we’re a shoo-in. Hell no. We still have prove ourselves on the court. In fact, every team, China, Iran, and Korea all included, will still have to earn those tickets to Spain on the hardwood. Iran has been practically invincible, but, like 2011, they can be upset. China remains shaky at the PG position, while the law of averages is bound to catch-up with Korea. It is in this spirit that I will look at each of the quarterfinal match-ups. I will try to dissect how each game will probably go, and who the probable survivors would be. Naturally, there are clear-cut favorites, but, again, that doesn’t mean wins will come easily.   Iran vs Jordan Iran will win because its terrific trio of Hamed Haddadi, Samad Nikkhah Nahrami, and Mahdi Kamrani has just been awesome. Haddadi will be fresh, considering he averages only about 20 minutes per game. Bahrami is in peak form, and Kamrani has, hands down, been the best all-around PG of the competition. The Iranians are also wary of what happened in 2011, when they underestimated the Jordanians in this very same round. They won’t be making the same mistake again. Jordan will win because I don’t think we have seen the best of Jimmy Baxter yet. Based on this guy’s skill-set, he should be scoring in the high 20s, but right now he averages a paltry 11.6ppg. If he can manage to Drop a big game on Iran, then Jordan should make things very interesting to say the least. Oh, and if shooters like Wesam Al Sous, Mahmoud Abdeen, and Mohammad Hadrab catch fire, this won’t be as one-sided as some people might assume. Remember, this same Jordanian team lost to this same Iranian team in the 2013 Jones Cup by just single digits. I’m picking IRAN as an 80-20 favorite.   Korea vs Qatar South Korea will win because, outside of Iran, this has been the most efficient and consistent team of the tournament. Coach Yoo Jae-Hak also has a very balanced team, with the scoring well-spread among a lot of players. There are six guys on this squad who average 7 or more points per game, led by gunner Cho Sung-Min. The others are guards Kim Min-Goo and Kim Sun-Hyung, while big men Kim Joo-Sung, Lee Seung-Jun, and Lee Jong-Hyun have also proven to be potent scorers. As long as Korea plays its normal game, then they should get by Qatar. Qatar will win because of its physicality and the momentum it gained after beating Taiwan. The loss to Gilas should have deflated Al Ennabi, but, instead, the Qataris rallied to deal Chinese-Taipei its first loss and are now legitimate threats to the Koreans. There are four guys who score 10 or more points on this team, and coach Tom Wisman will need every single one of them to be on-target if Qatar hopes to crash the semifinals. Also, guys like Yasseen Musa, Erfan Ali Saeed, and Mohammed Yousef will need to be rock-solid in the paint as the Koreans haven’t proven to be the best rebounders so far (QAT grabs nearly 44rpg, while KOR just gets 35.4rpg). I’m picking SOUTH KOREA as a 60-40 favorite   China vs Chinese Taipei China will win because it’s just a deeper team, and, well, Yi Jianlian should be fresh and ready to dominate. Taiwan’s tallest players are Quincy Davis and Tseng Wen-Ting, both of whom stand 6’8″, while about half of China’s team is 6’9″ or taller. I don’t see coach Giannakis Panagiotis holding back in this one, so we should see the brand of Chinese basketball we’ve been used to. That means guys like Wang Shipeng should rain down those threes, while Yi and the other two Wangs — Zhizhi and Zhelin — should lord it down low. Chinese Taipei will win because its shooters can catch fire at the drop of a hat. Even if he didn’t score in the Qatar loss, Lin Chih-Chieh is the type of player who can make things happen in a snap. I expect him to drop a big game on the Chinese, while also finding snipers like Lu Cheng-Ju, Yang Chin-Min, and Tien Lei open to drain those triples. A key will be the PG position. If Lee Hsueh-Lin can orchestrate things well on offense and be pesky against China’s inexperienced playmakers, then Taiwan has an outside chance of making the biggest upset of the tournament. I’m picking CHINA as an 80-20 favorite.   The Philippines vs Kazakhstan The Philippines will win because this is exactly the QF match-up the team has been preparing for since before the tournament opened. The Pinoys will also be extra-motivated to beat Kazakhstan, since the last time any Philippine team has beaten the Snow Leopards in official FIBA Asia/ABC play was, if I remember correctly, way back in the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games (twice at that).   The advantages of Gilas, of course, will be speed, shooting, and Marcus Douthit. If coach Chot Reyes’s wards can force turnovers and get in transition, they will be tough to stop. Likewise if shooters like Jeff Chan, Larry Fonacier, and, please, Gary David can find their mark. The main key, however, will be Douthit. If he’s reasonably healthy and mobile, then  a return trip to the final four should be in the horizon for Gilas. Kazakhstan will win because they have good size at every position and, should he play, Jerry Johnson should be more than a match for any of Gilas’s guards. At any point in the game, coach Matteo Boniciolii can insert a myriad of bigs to make life tough for Marcus — Anton Ponomarev, Leonid Bondarovich, Vitaliy Lapchenko, Alex Zhigulin, Dimo Klimov, and Mikhail Yevstigneyev. All those guys are bruisers, and most of them have decent perimeter game, too. In the backcourt, Johnson has able partners in the two Rustams — Yargaliev and Murzagaliev — both of whom have good vision and court sense. In short, even if this is the perceived “ideal match-up” for Gilas, and even if the Kazakhs lost to Gilas in a tune-up game, this affair will be closer than expected.

Malacañang: admin allies won’t be spared pork barrel scam probe. Two more Customs officials offer to resign.","body":" Today on Rappler.    Story 1: MIRIAM TO AQUINO: WHY SILENT ON PORK?Sen Miriam Santiago criticizes President Benigno Aquino’s silence on the pork barrel scam in his State of the Nation Address Monday.In a television interview Wednesday, Santiago says, “He should have discussed that because the theme of this administration is the straight and narrow path against corruption.”The Philippine Daily Inquirer reports the alleged P10-billion or $230 million pork barrel scam involved at least 5 senators and 23 congressmen.Lawmakers released their pork or discretionary funds to fake organizations questioned by state auditors over a 5 year period. Rappler also reported even administration allies gave funds to questionable NGOs.Santiago says the reports are “very scandalous” and merits a discussion in the President’s annual report.Among the senators tagged in the scandal is Santiago’s rival, Senate Minority Leader Juan Ponce Enrile and his allies Senators Jinggoy Estrada and Gringo Honasan. Malacañang defends the omission of topics in the SONA, saying the President had limited time to mention all sectors.  Story 2: PALACE WON’T SPARE AQUINO ALLIES IN PORK SCAM PROBEPresidential Spokesperson Edwin Lacierda says the investigation on the pork barrel scam will be exhaustive and won’t spare administration allies.Quoting President Aquino, Lacierda says, “This travesty will be investigated and we will investigate it no matter where the evidence will lead.”Lacierda’s comments come after a Rappler report linked 15 administration allies to the scam. Several legislators in the Commission on Audit report deny knowledge of their pork barrel going to NGOs questioned by state auditors.The original list of whistleblower Benhur Luy included at least 5 senators and 23 congressmen and only included members of the opposition, raising concerns the exposé was politically motivated.Malacañang repeatedly said it will wait for results of the investigation before making any comments. Story 3: BIAZON: POLITICIAN BACKERS WORSEN CUSTOMS CORRUPTIONCustoms Commissioner Ruffy Biazon wants politicians to keep their hands off the Bureau of Customs, saying they are part of the reason why corruption persists.A day after President Aquino scolded Customs in his State of the Nation Address, Biazon says band-aid solutions will not work in an agency where corruption is systemic.Biazon tweeted minutes later that he offered to resign, but the President reportedly told him, “My confidence in you remains the same.”In a press conference Tuesday, Biazon says he wants to propose a policy prohibiting recommendations for employment in the bureau to insulate Customs from political influence.Without naming names, Biazon says corrupt employees become audacious with their illegal activities because of political backers.This is the first time Biazon has identified meddling politicians as part of the problem.Aquino, citing Department of Finance estimates, says P200 billion in revenues are lost because of corruption in the Bureau of Customs.This, despite Biazon’s efforts to file charges against smugglers.Talks about Biazon being replaced because of poor revenue performance have been swirling on and off since he assumed office. Story 4: MORE CUSTOMS OFFICIALS OFFER TO QUITTwo more customs officials offer to resign following President Aquino’s scathing criticism of the agency.Presidential Spokesperson Edwin Lacierda confirms Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa received the resignation letter of Customs Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence Danny Lim, but says the President has not yet decided whether to accept.Lacierda adds Ochoa’s office has not received the resignation letter of Deputy Commissioner for Internal Administration Group Juan Lorenzo Tañada, who also offered to quit.On Tuesday, Lim tells Rappler he tried to resign 6 times in the 22 months he’s been in office, but was rejected.Lim says the customs bureau is “tough” given the –quote– “various external forces beyond your control.”Lacierda says reforms have already been discussed and will be implemented in the agency. Story 5: ESCUDERO FOR FINANCE, PIA GETS EDUCATIONThe Senate announces changes in committee chairmanships Wednesday, with Sen Francis Escudero now heading the powerful finance committee and Sen Pia Cayetano leading the education panel.The finance panel is one of the key Senate committees because it scrutinizes the national budget. Liberal Party member Sen TG Guingona retains his chairmanship of the blue ribbon committee, which investigates irregularities in government.No committee chairmanship is announced for the minority so far.In an interview after the session, Senate Majority leader Alan Cayetano says the changes were prompted by discussions within the majority group.Cayetano says there will be consultations on committee chairmanships for the members of the minority led by Sen Juan Ponce Enrile.Sen Jinggoy Estrada of the minority says, by his count, only the chairmanships of 6 committee are up for grabs: labor, civil service, economic affairs, social welfare, urban planning, and ethics.Estrada says it is still uncertain whether his group will accept any committee chairmanships  Story 6: ARROYO PRESSES FOR BAIL IN PLUNDER CASEFormer President and now Pampanga Rep Gloria Arroyo asks the Sandiganbayan to grant her petition for bail and order her release from hospital arrest. Invoking humanitarian grounds, Arroyo says there is no evidence in the plunder case against her.Arroyo is accused of amassing ill-gotten wealth when P366 million of Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office operating funds were converted into intelligence funds and disbursed.Arroyo is under hospital arrest and is charged with plunder – a non-bailable offense. In a motion filed through lawyers, the 66-year-old Arroyo says her poor health and her stature as a re-elected member of the Lower House constitute enough ground to negate suspicions she can be considered a flight risk. Story 7: CHIEF JUSTICE TAKES UP CUDGELS FOR RH LAWChief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno defends the Reproductive Health law on day 2 of the oral arguments Tuesday.Sereno repeats the position she raised on Day 1: that the Court is not the proper body to throw out the law that funds the distribution of contraceptives.Anti-RH lawyer Luisito Liban says the RH law is “arbitrary.”He asks why there is no law to address “serious illnesses” like diabetes and heart diseases which kill more Filipinos.To this, Sereno answers, “How can you raise arbitrariness if this has been debated for 13 years?”Sereno suggests a “political solution” for anti-RH advocates is to get more allies elected.She says, “The solution is to get more people who think like you elected in Congress. It is not for us to cure problems you see in Congress.”Liban finds an ally in Justice Roberto Abad, who cites medical studies likening hormonal contraceptives to “poison.”Liban says by allowing hormonal contraceptives in the law, the government arbitrarily declared hormonal contraceptives safe.Abad echoes arguments made by anti-RH lawyer Maria Concepcion Noche that some contraceptives are “hazardous” to health. The next session is scheduled on August 6.Anti-RH lawyer Luis Gana will discuss how the RH law supposedly violates the Organic Act of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao by requiring local governments to support for RH efforts. Story 8: FILIPINOS SLAM CHINA OVER SOUTH CHINA SEAA group called the West Philippine Sea Coalition takes to the streets to protest China’s encroachment on Philippine territories.Paterno Esmaquel reports. It’s not Chinese New Year, but Filipinos protesting in front of the Chinese consulate say they want to drive bad spirits away.The rally is organized by the newly formed West Philippine Sea Coalition.Marimi dela Fuente says China’s claims will bring bad luck. MARIMI DE LA FUENTE, PROTESTER: Well I know the Chinese believe in feng shui, so they should know that it’s bad feng shui to take what isn’t yours. I want them to know that they cannot bully the Filipino people. It’s been a year since the Philippines and China escalated the word war over the territorial dispute.Beijing slams the Philippines’ case against China before a UN tribunal and refuses arbitration, while the Philippines insists China should follow international law.Former Senator Rene Saguisag says it’s time the Philippines put its foot down. RENE SAGUISAG, FORMER SENATOR: We have to take a stand, kasi ‘yung Ayungin, Scarborough, pinipitik na lang tayo eh. It’s our own self-interest. Hindi sa Kano, hindi sa Intsik, hindi sa Hapon, kundi kung anong ikabubuti ng Pilipino, dahil ayoko na paglaki ng mga apo ko, problema pa rin ito. Organizers say similar rallies will happen in other countries, such as the Australia, Canada, and the United States. RAFAEL ALUNAN, FORMER INTERIOR SECRETARY: We’re asking Filipinos to take leadership wherever they are. Hindi lang naman itong street rally ang avenue. Maraming avenues – there are international fore, social media. We can be very creative. On the day of the rally, the Palace says it has no hand in the protests.In a recent Pew survey thirty-nine percent of Filipinos surveyed see China as an “enemy”.Palace ties or not, protesters say their voices echo a growing sentiment. Paterno Esmaquel, Rappler, Manila. Story 9: FOREIGNER WRITES OPEN LETTER TO SONA’S CRYING COPA Dutch national who joined a rally to protest the State of the Nation Address gets mixed reactions on social media after a photo of the foreigner shouting at a policeman goes viral.On Monday, Thomas van Beersum shouts at PO1 Joselito Sevilla during a clash with protesters and police.Sevilla later broke down in tears.Van Beersum reportedly told Sevilla, “You are the ones that are hurting us! You started this conflict! Why are you doing this?” Sevilla reportedly replied, “I am a policeman. I’m just doing my job.” After a photo of the two circulated on social media, Van Beersum posted an open letter on Facebook.In the letter, he says,  “I write this letter because unlike the other police at the protest, you did not act violently like your mates and you did not attack us. You did what you thought was right.”Commission on Human Rights Chair Etta Rosales cries foul over Van Beersum’s behavior toward the policeman.Rosales says, “He has no business in the rally. It’s not his business shouting at an official.”Rosales says foreigners are allowed to join protests but they should respect Philippine authorities.A picture of the Dutch national later surfaces on social media showing him with Communist Party of the Philippines founder Jose Ma. Sison.Carlos Celdran tweets about that photo, “Guess who Tomas Van Beekass hung out with back home. Story 10: LOVE, SEX AND LADYBOYS What’s the dating scene like for Filipino transgenders? How do the ‘ladyboys’– as the transgenders are called — find love in the time of social media?Devon Wong reports. They say love makes the world go round, but finding the perfect partner is no easy feat.Men are from Mars, women are from Venus… and then there are the transgenders. MAKI GINGOYON, INTERNET ENTREPRENEUR: It’s complicated. Just like our lives, very complicated. Transgenders, or ladyboys, say dating has its extra challenges.  Everyone’s looking for love, but ladyboys also have to defy social stigma. It takes a certain open-minded man. MAKI GINGOYON, INTERNET ENTREPRENEUR: I don’t care how you define me, I don’t care how you categorize me, but what matters most is you are going to respect me as a human, at least, as a human. It’s an issue that hits close to home for Cyril and Maki.  With a limited dating pool, they met each other as many couples do, online. CYRIL MAZUR, INTERNET ENTREPRENEUR: I come from a small town in France, where there is virtually no transgender women at all, so the internet was the only thing I had to figure it out. It’s a personal advocacy for Cyril and Maki, who want to pioneer an online dating website for transgenders. MAKI GINGOYON, INTERNET ENTREPRENEUR: We would like to let people know that with myladyboydate.com, you can find genuine relationships. You can find someone who’s going to accept you for who you are. Early tests show a huge interest from the online community.  Membership numbers are climbing, while Cyril and Maki take their matchmaking roles very seriously. CYRIL MAZUR, INTERNET ENTREPRENEUR: We have a very strict policy on it, like you will never see any flesh or any skin on the website. Nothing sexually explicit will be allowed. We are making it very tight, also, on the screening of the profiles. Every profile is screened. Foreign men from across the world are setting up online profiles. But Cyril and Maki know that looks can be deceiving.Sex tourism in the Philippines is a growing issue that’s only recently being addressed at the national level.  This year, the Department of Tourism launched public policies to protect children from human trafficking.It’s a step forward from earlier attitudes.  In 2011, US Ambassador Harry Thomas Jr. suggested that 40% of tourists coming to the Philippines were “sexpats”.  It was a comment that was quick to offend government officials who adamantly denied the statistic.Cyril insists ladyboys are also unfairly targeted by sexpats because of local stereotypes. CYRIL MAZUR, INTERNET ENTREPRENEUR: Sex workers are the most visible. In terms of visibility, people tend to think, yeah, that’s the majority, but it’s not, it’s just the super visible. It’s his personal advocacy to help those looking for love in all the wrong places. CYRIL MAZUR, INTERNET ENTREPRENEUR: By doing this website I want to help these men to accept it. To maybe not say no to happiness just because society said so, or friends said so, or the media said so. The couple hopes to open the minds to transgender dating. The website may be connecting virtual strangers, but after all, love is blind. Devon Wong, Rappler, Manila.   Story 11: WILLIAM AND KATE TAKE HOME ROYAL BABYThe world gets its first glimpse of the royal baby after Prince William and his wife Kate appeared with their firstborn son outside the hospital where he was born Tuesday night — Wednesday morning in Manila.The unnamed prince, whose official title is “Prince of Cambridge,” is the third in line to the British throne after his father and grandfather, Prince Charles. When asked about a name, William says, “We’re still working on a name, we’ll have that as soon as we can.” The family leaves the hospital the same evening for Kensington Palace. The royal baby is born Monday after a much anticipated wait. Story 12: THE wRap: YOUR WORLD IN ONE READAt number 4, An asylum-seeker boat heading for Australia sinks off Java in Indonesia Tuesday night.Unconfirmed reports say as many as 100 are dead or missing. Indonesian authorities are conducting rescue operations.An official says the boat carried about 150 people, mostly from Sri Lanka and Iran.47 people are found alive.Australia is struggling to stem the flow of asylum-seekers arriving by boat, with more than 15,000 turning up so far in 2013.Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd recently announced a law which bans asylum seekers without visas from settling in Australia. At number 6, Pressure grows on Egypt’s new leaders to release Mohamed Morsi from detention as clashes between supporters and opponents of the deposed Islamist president leave 10 people dead. The clashes broke out Monday and continued through the night, injuring dozens of people and killing at least 6 people on Tuesday.Egypt’s new leadership says Morsi is in a “safe” place for his own good. And at number 8, Researchers report wild bottlenose dolphins use unique signature whistles to identify themselves.In a study of 200 bottlenose dolphins off Scotland, researchers find the dolphins also reply by echoing their whistles when they they hear it from another dolphin. Researchers say it’s the first evidence of naming and labeling in the animal kingdom.Other animals like songbirds and bats have been shown to be capable of copying sounds in their environment. But only parrots and dolphins use labels that they have learned for other objects or creatures. – Rappler.com Newscast production staff   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/34370-gilas-diaries-naturalized-players-part-2/","title":"Gilas Diaries: Asia’s Adopted Sons (Part 2)","date":"Jul 20, 2013 5:02 PM PHT","snippet":"Meet Asia's adopted sons -- players from other continents who will ply their trade in the FIBA Asia Championships.","body":"(Second of six parts) Part 1: The Adopted Sons of West and Central Asia MANILA, Philippines — It is July 19 here in Manila, and there are only 13 nights left before the 2013 FIBA Asia Men’s Championship Tournament, the first ever held in these parts in 4 decades, kicks off at the ultramodern Mall of Asia Arena and the historic Ninoy Aquino Stadium. An air of excitement can be felt all around the metropolis as promotions for the event continue to ramp up each day. Various signs along highways, advertisements on radio and TV, and promo spots on YouTube have popped up, readying the rabid Filipino populace for what should be the biggest sporting event of the year. And as the last one-time-big-time FIBA Asia Men’s Championship (the format will change after the 2014 World Cup) closes in, we will take a look at the players and teams who will take part in it. I actually wanted to start with a reasonably thorough team-by-team preview (I mean, honestly, who else is going to do that here in Manila, right?), but seeing as FIBA Asia has not yet publicized the official submitted 12-man rosters of each team (despite the deadline coming and going last July 12), I am forced to look at the players from a different perspective. In this second of a 6-part series, I will look at some key players who will undoubtedly make a great impact in the tournament. In the first two parts, I will put the spotlight on the naturalized players from West/Central Asia and East Asia. In parts 3 and 4, I will focus on the veterans who are still persistently chugging along despite wobbly knees, and in the last two parts, I will write about the stars who are expected to be in peak form when the basketball version of Thrilla in Manila commences. I hope that at the end of this series, Rappler readers and fans of Asian hoops will be more enlightened, and that FIBA Asia will finally release the official rosters. Please lang. Here we go.  Parts 1 & 2 are entitled Adopted Sons because I will detail the naturalized players expected to take part in the August joust. The naturalized players, of course, are those who were born citizens of a different country and who, eventually, chose to become citizens of their new Asian homes. By virtue of this, they have also chosen to play for a flag, a nation, a culture, and a people not entirely (originally) their own, but it is the hope of this new flag, nation, and culture, and the faith of these people that are carried by these adopted sons. Lee Seung-Jun a.k.a. Eric Sandrin, South Korea Specs: 6’9″, 35 years oldCollege: Seattle Pacific University Falcons (2000-2002)Latest Achievement: Led South Korea’s title romp at the 2013 East Asia Basketball Championships in Incheon.Last Tournament: Played in the 2013 William Jones Cup (Taiwan), helping Korea grab 3rd place behind Iran and Taiwan-A. The games versus Lebanon were all nullified. Had they been retained, Korea would’ve had the second-best record at 6-2. Seung-Jun isn’t really supposed to be counted as a naturalized player, since he is technically half-Korean and has played for the Korean NT as a local in past continental tournaments. The most recent citizenship snafu (see Wuhan 2011), however, has rendered him a naturalized player. Contrary to my own expectations, he was picked by coach Yoo Jae-Hak over another half-Korean – Moon Tae-Young (a.k.a. Greg Stevenson). I expected Moon to get the nod mainly because he plays for Yoo in the KBL, but Seung-Jun’s great performance in the Jones Cup probably gave him the edge over Moon. Seung-Jun will be an awesome complement to the frontcourt of Korea, especially since he can practically do anything. He is athletic despite his advanced age, he can hit the jumper with consistency, and he is exceptional in the open court. This is in contrast to his projected frontline partner – veteran Kim Joo-Sung, who prefers to get the ball on the low block and operate as a traditional big man. Together with Joo-Sung and Korea’s promising young and tall duo of Kim Jong-Kyu and Lee Jong-Hyun, Seung-Jun should make life really tough for the opposing bigs, especially considering China’s Wang Zhizhi won’t be around and Arsalan Kazemi doubtful to rejoin Iran after the NBA camps.  JR Sakuragi a.k.a. JR Henderson, Japan Specs: 6’9″. 37 years oldCollege: University of California – Los Angeles Bruins (1994-1998)Latest Achievement: Helped Japan to a second-place finish in the 2012 FIBA Asia Cup in Tokyo.Last Tournament: Played 47 games for the Asishin Seahorses in the 2013 Japanese Basketball League, averaging 15.5ppg, 12.4rpg, 4.4apg, and shooting 50% from the field and 34% from downtown. Sakuragi will go to Manila as one of the oldest players to participate in the 2013 FIBA Asia tournament. But don’t let that fool you. This guy can still play. Japan lacked a second consistent big man in the recently concluded Jones Cup, and this is where Sakuragi comes in as he should complement the game of Kosuke Takeuchi very well. I expect Sakuragi will probably play the center position and Takeuchi will slide down to PF, which is his natural international position. The absence of Kosuke’s twin brother, Joji, however, is a significant development, since only Atsuya Ota, Sean Hinkley, and youngster Yuta Watanabe will be left as relievers. They are all serviceable players, of course, but when push comes to shove, especially against the likes of Yaseen Ismail Musa (QAT), Quincy Davis (TPE), and Marcus Douthit (PHI), those guys might not be up to the task. This means even more pressure is put on Sakuragi to not only perform well, but to play a lot of minutes, too. The name of the game for him is BOTH quality and quantity. Quincy Davis, Chinese Taipei Specs: 6’9″, 30 years oldCollege: Tulane University Green Wave (2002-2006)Latest Achievement & Tournament: Led Taiwan to a second-place finish in the 2013 William Jones Cup, finishing behind Iran. He was named a member of the tournament’s First Team and All-Defensive Team. Davis changes the dynamics of Taiwan in a very big way. He plugs their donut hole and just completes the team in much the same way Marcus Douthit did for Gilas Pilipinas in 2011. Does this make Taiwan an instant title contender? I wouldn’t go that far, but I believe this is their best chance to catch a podium finish ever since they finished 3rd in 1989. Similar to Japan, Taiwan can now afford to move Tseng Wen-Ting to his natural PF position, facing up the opposition to showcase his dangerous midrange game or his passing skills as Davis makes the seal in the paint. This was the team’s bread-and-butter during the Jones Cup, and we will probably see this often in Manila, too. This also means there are now two inside options for coach Hsu Chin-Tse, which means he can allow shooters like Lin Chih-Chieh and Lu Cheng-Ju to have more wiggle room at the wings. All in all, Davis just bumped Taiwan up the ladder in a significant way. Marcus Douthit, Philippines Specs: 6’11″, 33 years oldCollege: Providence College Friars (2000-2004)Latest Achievement: Led Gilas Pilipinas to the championship in the 2012 William Jones Cup. He was named to the tournament’s first team.Latest Tournament: Helped Gilas place fourth in the 2012 FIBA Asia Cup, averaging 15.2ppg, 11.3rpg, and 1.7bpg while shooting 64% from the field. When this tournament is done, I am certain Douthit will go down as one of the best naturalized players to ever play in FIBA Asia, alongside greats like Joseph Vogel and Rasheim Wright. Over the past few years, he has been able to complement the Filipinos’ game really well, and in his last tour of duty for Gilas, I am sure he will not disappoint. Unlike in previous tournaments, Douthit now has a young and promising big who can spell him for a few minutes or play alongside him as a PF/C. That guy, of course, is June Mar Fajardo, the 6’10″ wonder from Cebu who has blossomed into a young star in the PBA. With Fajardo in the fold, Douthit should no longer be as worried about grabbing every rebound or being the last line of defense every single time down the floor. Aside from that, though, Douthit’s main asset going into the championships is his prior experience in FIBA Asia. Unlike some of the other guys like Jimmy Baxter, Jarvis Hayes, or Quincy Davis, Douthit has been a FIBA Asia mainstay for several years now. He knows the grind, and he knows the necessary adjustments that have to be made. In all, the expectations of Douthit are huge this year, and I have no doubt he will rise up to meet or even exceed them. #parasabayan – Rappler.com   Enzo Flojo is one of the closest followers of the Philippine National Basketball Team.

Story 1: FILIPINA WINS HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASEA Filipina caregiver based in Canada wins a human trafficking case against her former employer, the first of its kind in British Columbia history.The verdict came after a 4 week trial intensely followed by local media.On June 26, Franco Orr was convicted of 3 counts under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Orr could face a maximum life sentence or a $1 million fine or both.In an interview with Philippine Asian News Today, Leticia Sarmiento says the conviction is a victory for fellow live-in caregivers who are oppressed abroad. Sarmiento was brought to Canada by the couple in September 2008 under a visitor’s visa. Instead of just taking care of the couple’s 3 children, Sarmiento says she was made to do household chores and worked 16-hour days with no days off for close to two years.Police rescued her in June 2010 after she called 911 following a heated argument with Orr’s wife. Story 2: GOV’T, MILF HOPE FOR A BREAKTHROUGHA day before the start of Ramadan, the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front resume negotiations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, hoping to come closer to a peace agreement.Before the formal meeting, MILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal tells Rappler the MILF is returning to the negotiating table with guarded optimism as both sides attempt to resolve the deadlock on wealth-sharing and power-sharing.Iqbal says, “The fact that we are here shows we are committed but the issues are really tough.”Top of the agenda is to complete the wealth-sharing annex between the Bangsamoro political entity and the national government.The Philippine Daily Inquirer reports the MILF wants a 75-25% wealth-sharing across the board, which is higher than what the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao currently enjoys. But the government says there is a formula to be followed in computing wealth-sharing.Of the 4 annexes needed to complete the final peace pact, only the annex on transition arrangements and modalities has been signed. Aside from the wealth-sharing annex, the annexes on power-sharing and normalization have yet to be completed.In an interview, government chief negotiator Miriam Ferrer says President Benigno Aquino ordered them to come up with an inclusive agreement that will get broad public support. MIRIAM FERRER, GOVERNMENT PEACE PANEL CHAIR: I think we’re very conscious that this is a problem-solving session, the discussions for these rounds are all geared at finding solutions to the issues that have long been discussed. Story 3: 36 DIE IN CLASHES AHEAD OF PEACE TALKSAt least 31 Muslim rebels and 5 soldiers are killed in clashes as the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front resume peace talks in Malaysia, Monday. The military says the splinter rebel group Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, or BIFF, set off a roadside bomb as a military truck drove past in Datu Piang Saturday, killing 3 soldiers. The rebels simultaneously attacked an army detachment in another section of the town, killing two other soldiers. In a statement, regional military commander Maj Gen Romeo Gapuz says, “The BIFF is hell-bent on derailing the peace talks by launching simultaneous attacks against civilian and military installations.” A military spokesman confirms soldiers penetrated Ganta in Shariff Saydona Mustapha, a BIFF stronghold, resulting in heavy casualties on the enemy side.

The Enrile family’s Pacific Royal Basic Foods Inc. practically bankrolled his failed bid with a generous P135.96 million contribution — even though the company only had a net income of P81.84 million in 2011. JV Ejercito’s senatorial campaign got P43.96 million from an NGO called JV Para sa Bayan Movement Inc, despite reporting a capital of only P90,000. The NGO was incorporated on December 13, 2012, or 5 months before this year’s midterm elections.

Story 6: INFORMAL SETTLERS UNDER A BRIDGE AWAIT RELOCATIONThey live under the bridge to survive. Now the government is offering informal settlers along the Tullahan river a chance to move to houses safe from floods.Raisa Serafica reports. To motorists, this bridge is just another road. But to Juliana Paquibot and her neighbors, it’s home.Juliana is one of 1,400 informal settler families living by the Tullahan River in Valenzuela City.   She earns three hundred twenty five pesos a day as a janitor, way below the daily minimum wage of P450, barely enough for basic needs.So despite the danger, Juliana decided to settle under the bridge. JULIANA PAQUIBOT, INFORMAL SETTLER: Eh dun kasi, kahit squatter, nag-uupa kami ng 1,500. Ang liit liit lang ng kwarto dun kasi mas puntahan siya sa tubig kaysa dito. Nag-evacuate-an kami, dyan kami sa kalsada natutulog. Kasi yung inupahan namin, itnangay yung pinakalikod niya. Halos kaming lahat naman. (Even if I rent in a squatter area, it still costs P1,500 .  The room is small outside because water directly flows there. They say it is also dangerous to live here under the bridge but I haven’t experienced it yet.  Nevertheless, we have nowhere else to go.) But if plans push through she’ll no longer be at risk every time it rains and the river swells.The government plans to relocate settlers in waterways in Metro Manila as part of its anti-flood masterplan.  The National Housing Authority says 19,400 families will be relocated before the year ends. CHITO CRUZ, GENERAL MANAGER, NATIONAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION: Maganda na yung ating mga units. Nothing comparable to what they used to, yung dating mga relocation sites natin, maganda na ngayon. And we’re actually proud of what we have, the new relocation site that we’ve been building for them. (Our housing units are good and they’re nothing comparable to the old relocation sites.  And we’re actually proud of our new relocation sites that we’ve been building for them.) NHA says that Juliana Paquibot and her neighbors will be moved to a relocation site called Disiplina Village, also in Valenzuela City. To Juliana, this is good news.

Story 7: ASIANA CRASHES IN SAN FRANCISCO; 2 DEADAn Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 crash lands at the San Francisco International Airport Saturday — Sunday in Manila — killing 2 teenage girls and injuring 182.CNN reports the bodies of the 2 girls were found on the runway next to the burning plane.Authorities say one of them may have been struck by a first responder’s vehicle.Asiana Flight 214 was at the end of a 10-hour direct flight from Seoul, South Korea. The aircraft touched down heavily on the runway close to the water’s edge before it disappeared in a cloud of smoke. CNN reports pilots tried to abort the landing just 1.5 seconds before the plane crashed.The National Transportation Safety Board says the pilots appear to have increased speed 7 seconds before impact and then –quote– “called to initiate a go-around 1.5 seconds to impact.”Preliminary assessment of the plane’s cockpit and flight data recorders show the flight was coming in too slow. On Monday, Asiana Airlines says the pilot in charge of the plane when it crashed was still in training for the Boeing 777.But Asiana says he was accompanied by an experienced trainer, who acted as co-pilot. Story 8: THE wRap: YOUR WORLD IN ONE READAt number 4, the New York Times reports American diplomats are trying to persuade the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt to accept the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi. But an Islamist comments,“They are asking us to legitimize the coup,” adding accepting Morsi’s ouster would spell the death of Egyptian democracy.Splits among the country’s newly dominant political forces already show.On Saturday, state news media report diplomat Mohamed ElBaradei was chosen as prime minister, but the presidency later backed away from the report after ultraconservatives reject ElBaradei for being too secular. The infighting leaves a power vacuum that makes it unclear who is running the country. At number 5, Radical cleric Abu Qatada is being held in a high security jail near the Jordanian capital Amman, after being deported from the UK. A BBC report says Prime Minister David Cameron is “delighted” at his removal. Abu Qatada was first arrested in the UK over terrorist connections in 2001 and fought deportation since 2005. His deportation proceeded after the UK and Jordan signed a treaty agreeing that evidence obtained through torture would not be used against him. Abu Qatada, whose real name is Omar Othman, was granted asylum in the UK in 1994 but was later seen by authorities as a threat. Military prosecutors charge Abu Qatada with conspiracy to carry out a plot to bomb American and Israeli tourists during Jordan’s millennium celebrations. And at number 10, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Bolivia offer asylum to fugitive US whistleblower Edward Snowden. Nicaragua reveals details of Snowden’s letter, in which he says he’s unlikely to receive “a fair trial” in the United States.On Saturday, Russian lawmaker Aleksei Pushkov says political asylum in Venezuela would be the “best solution” for Snowden. He tweets, “The country has a sharp conflict with the United States. It will not be worse.” The New York Times reports the US and Venezuela recently began talks for reconciliation, but a senior US official says this would end if Venezuela helped Snowden.

Some 900 delegates from more than 50 countries will meet in Naypyidaw for the World Economic Forum on East Asia — the region’s equivalent of the annual gathering of business and political luminaries in the Swiss resort of Davos. “This is our show. This is our performance to the world,” Tourism Minister Htay Aung said ahead of the three-day event. President Thein Sein’s quasi-civilian government has surprised the world since coming to power two years ago with dramatic political and economic changes that have led to the lifting of most Western sanctions. Hundreds of political prisoners have been freed, democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi has been welcomed into a new parliament and tentative ceasefires have been reached in the country’s multiple ethnic civil wars. On the eve of the conference, former general Thein Sein said in a radio address to the nation that all remaining prisoners of conscience would soon be freed. Activists say some 200 political prisoners remain in jail. They have accused Myanmar of using a series of headline-grabbing amnesties for political gain, aware that the international community is watching. In his speech, Thein Sein insisted the aim of the amnesties was “national reconciliation”. “There is no other political advantage that we want,” he added. Both Thein Sein and Suu Kyi are scheduled to address the forum on Thursday. After years lagging behind its more developed neighbors, Myanmar is now taking steps to revive its impoverished economy. The currency was floated last year, there are moves to give the central bank more independence and a new foreign investment law has been passed. Foreign firms are queuing up to enter the country formerly known as Burma. They include Coca-Cola, which is returning to Myanmar after an absence of more than six decades with a new bottling plant opened on Tuesday. Sushant Palakurthi Rao, Asia head of the WEF, said the Myanmar forum was “by far the largest” meeting of the group. “I think these numbers are a clear expression of the tremendous interest from all walks of life,” he said. Experts say businesses entering Myanmar face major hurdles, including an opaque legal framework as well as a lack of basic infrastructure and government and private sector expertise. Several outbreaks of deadly religious violence have also cast a shadow over the reform process. A handout notice from the forum gives delegates some taste of the business challenges facing the country, noting that there will be no cash machines for international customers, credit cards are not accepted and the 3G network “is not available” for users of BlackBerry and other mobile phones. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/30089-bill-grabber-senator-blamed-centenarian-bill-veto/","title":"‘Bill grabber’ senator blamed for veto of Centenarian bill","date":"May 28, 2013 1:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Sen Francis Pangilinan maintains that Rep Edcel Lagman agreed to the provision that prompted President Aquino to veto the bill","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Outgoing Albay Rep Edcel Lagman is blaming Sen Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan for the veto of the “Centenarian bill” that will benefit about 7,000 Filipinos, based on Lagman’s estimates. He called the senator a “bill grabber,” a move which Pangilinan lamented as “name-calling.” The measure sought to grant Filipinos who reach 100 years old various rewards and incentives, including a cash gift of P100,000 from Malacañang and a birthday letter from the President. (READ: When is your 100th birthday? You may get 100,000!) Lagman said President Benigno Aquino III vetoed the bill because of a provision that was added by Pangilinan last minute — to increase to 75% the discount of the sale of goods and services to centenarians. Pangilinan maintained Lagman agreed to it.  The President’s veto message reads: “The 75-percent discount exceeds the usual mark-up rate of most businesses and will obliterate profit margins and result in capital loss” because “the proposed measure does not provide for a tax deduction to recover the said discount.”  The House version proposed a 50-percent discount for centenarians.  “Bill grabbers are sometimes the bane of legislation because instead of assuring the enactment of a measure into law, they prejudice the final approval of a bill by the President,” Lagman said in a statement on Tuesday, May 28. Pangilinan said it had the backing of Lagman. “The record will show that he agreed to adopt the proposal and now with the veto he flip flops and does a 180 degree turn and resorts to finger pointing and namecalling,” Pangilinan told Rappler. “I expected better from a seasoned legislator. That’s most unfortunate,” Pangilinan added. Lagman claimed they were forced to accept the Senate amendment because there was no time to reconcile the conflicting versions of the House and Senate. The Senate approved its version shortly before Congress adjourned for the campaign. “The original House bill provided for only 50% discount as an “exception from the value-added tax (VAT), if applicable”, and as an amendment to the various Senior Citizens Acts but without removing the tax credit or deduction in favor of concerned establishments so that they will not incur business losses,” Lagman’s statement reads. “Since there was no more time to harmonize the difference between the House and Senate bills through a bicameral conference, the House of Representatives was constrained to concur with the Senate amendment,” Lagman said.  Lagman said his son and namesake Edcel Lagman Jr – who was elected to take his seat in Congress – will re-file the bill. “Meanwhile, more centenarians will be gone without getting the legislated benefits.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/29388-canvass-report-6/","title":"22% canvassed: Alan grabs Chiz’s spot","date":"May 16, 2013 3:58 PM PHT","snippet":"Based on the latest official count, Dick Gordon is also out of the winning slate","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Re-electionist Sen Alan Peter Cayetano grabbed the 3rd spot from his fellow re-electionist, Sen Chiz Escudero, after canvassers processed over 20% of certificates of canvass (COCs) Thursday, May 16.

Last weekend’s Monte Carlo runner-up regained his accustomed position on an ATP winner’s podium with his fourth title of 2013 and his third on clay for the year. He rallied from two breaks down on a day of drizzle and heavy conditions, beating Almagro for the tenth time without defeat. “I’m very happy,” said Nadal. “This has been an important week for me. To win here again is a great joy after everything I’ve been through. “It was a fantastic match for me,” he told a crowd which had huddled under umbrellas for the duration of the contest. “Thanks to the people who watched us.” Storming comeback The world number five has made a storming comeback to tennis after missing seven months from last summer with knee injuries. Since his February return, he has played finals in all six events he has entered. Nadal went into recovery mode after trailing Almagro 0-3 in less than a quarter hour on the heavy court. But as quickly as he had temporarily let his guard down, Nadal was able to muster his resources to fight back. He claimed an epic ninth game for a 5-4 lead before serving out the opening set a game later as Almagro couldn’t reach a forehand to the corner. The second seed sped away with the second set in the testing conditions and finished off the victory with an overhead smash. “I’m used to losing to Rafa,” said Almagro. “But matches like this are what makes you a better player. First to four titles in 2013 “I started well but after it really started to rain the balls got heavy and Rafa found his game in the conditions.” Nadal becomes the first man this season to win four ATP titles, adding Barcelona to those he lifted in Brazil, Mexico and California. The 26-year-old who is rediscovering the form that habitually makes him the favourite when the French Open comes around in May. This victory took his Barcelona win streak to 39 matches. In clay finals, the impeccable Spaniard has lost only to Djokovic (three times), Roger Federer (twice) and Horacio Zeballos (once). He now stands 40-1 in Barcelona. The win was the second of the season for Nadal over Almagro after beating his countryman in the Acapulco semi-final.

Story 1: OBAMA: BOSTON BLASTS AN ‘ACT OF TERROR’US President Barack Obama says the Boston bombings are an act of terror, but it’s still unclear who was behind the attacks.On Monday, two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston marathon, killing three and injuring at least 140.In a statement, Obama says the motives and identity of those responsible remain unclear. BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: This was a heinous and cowardly act.  And given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism.  Any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians it is an act of terror. What we don’t yet know, however, is who carried out this attack or why, whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual. On Tuesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation says no one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.In a press conference, FBI Special Agent Rick DesLauriers says, “The range of suspects and motives remains wide open.”DesLauriers says investigators recover items from both blast sites, including black nylon bags in which the bombs are believed to have been hidden.He adds, “Fragments of BBs (ball bearings) and nails, possibly contained in a pressure-cooker device” are also recovered and sent to the FBI laboratory for analysis. Story 2: NORTH KOREA BARS SOUTH ‘HUMANITARIAN’ DELEGATIONNorth Korea bars a delivery of supplies to South Koreans in the closed Kaesong joint industrial zone.Ten businessmen representing the 123 South Korean firms in Kaesong applied for permission to visit the zone to bring food and supplies to their staff, two weeks after the North blocked all access to Kaesong.North Korea denied the request for a visit.Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyung-Seok says, “It is very regrettable that the North has rejected the request and disallowed a humanitarian measure.”Around 200 South Koreans remain in Kaesong.On April 8, the North withdrew its 53,000 workers in the industrial zone.North Korea dismisses Seoul’s offers of dialogue as a quote — “crafty trick”.It says the South wanted to shift responsibility for Kaesong’s closure, which Pyongyang insists is forced by Seoul’s quote —  “war-mongering” statements. Story 3: SENATE BETS: EXPECT ‘UNLI ADS’ WITH SC RULINGSome senatorial candidates oppose the Supreme Court decision stopping the Commission on Elections from implementing airtime limits on political ads.Under Comelec chair Sixto Brillantes, national candidates only have 120 minutes on all TV networks and 180 minutes in all radio stations.In a tweet, Bayan Muna Rep Teddy Casiño says, “With its [order], the Supreme Court has allowed unli ads.”San Juan Rep JV Ejercito says, “The airtime limit set by the Comelec levels the playing fields among candidates. The SC decision prohibiting it is not for a fair campaign.”Zambales Rep Mitos Magsaysay questions the timing of the release of the court’s decision, which comes less than a month before the May 13 polls.But Senate Minority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano hails the decision, saying it will let voters in rural areas have access to information about candidates.In February, broadcast networks GMA-7, TV5, and the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas says the Comelec rule violates people’s right to information.In past elections, the Comelec under chairman Benjamin Abalos imposed a more liberal interpretation of the law: 120 minutes per TV station, and 180 minutes per radio station.

For the May 2013 polls, the Comelec reverts to the original rule on airtime: national candidates only have 120 minutes on all TV networks and 180 minutes in all radio stations.Brillantes criticizes the high court for its process in issuing temporary restraining orders and status quo ante orders. SIXTO BRILLANTES JR, COMELEC CHAIRMAN: Kung mali kami, sasabihin nila may grave abuse of discretion. Yun ang authority ng Supreme Court under the Constitution.

Story 5: LAKAS ENDORSES Bnil a, GORDON, VILLAR, VILLANUEVAThe Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats endorses 4 more senatorial bets, bringing the number of candidates it supports at the national level to 10.On Wednesday, the party announces it supports Nancy Binay and Richard Gordon of the United Nationalist Alliance, Cynthia Villar of Team PNoy, and Eddie Villanueva of Bangon Pilipinas.Last week, the party announced its endorsement of 6 other candidates — 4 from UNA and 2 from Team PNoy.Lakas president Leyte Rep Martin Romualdez says the last two slots will depend on the decision of Lakas-CMD members at the local level.But the party –quote– “strongly recommends” Sen Loren Legarda, Margarita Cojuangco, Ernesto Maceda and Miguel Zubiri for the last two slots. Story 6: NULLIFY MINING ACT OR JUST THE DENR ORDER?The Supreme Court holds oral arguments Tuesday on consolidated petitions seeking the nullification of sections 80 and 81 of the Mining Act of 1995.Justices study the petitions on whether to strike down as unconstitutional the provisions on the profit-sharing agreement or amend the law’s department administrative order.Petitioners Risa Hontiveros, Teddy Casiño, Erin Tañada and others – say Sections 80 and 81 put the government at a financial disadvantage.They say section 80 limits the government’s share in the Mineral Production Sharing Agreement to excise taxes, while Section 81 limits the government’s share to taxes, fees and royalties instead of allowing full control on the development of mineral resources.They also say the DENR Order 07-12 results in the inequitable sharing of wealth.Justice Antonio Carpio says prescribing the terms in the profit-sharing agreement is within the President’s discretion. But Justice Presbitero Velasco Jr says it is better to amend the department order than nullify the provisions of the Mining Act.Former Constitutional Commission member Christian Monsod says the profit-sharing agreement does not consider the “negative externalities” of the mining industry, such as displacement. Story 7: DFA APPEALS TO OFWs IN JEDDAH CAMP SITEThe Foreign Affairs department appeals to overseas Filipinos workers camping outside the Philippine Consulate building in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia as the crackdown on illegal and overstaying migrant workers continues.On Tuesday, DFA spokesperson Raul Hernandez says, “Please do not risk your health and safety by setting up camps and exposing yourselves to the elements.”Filipino migrant rights group Migrante says the number of Filipinos who set up camp surges to about 1,450 Filipinos in 6 days.In a statement, Migrante-Middle East regional coordinator John Leonard Monterona warns the situation could lead to a quote– “full-blown humanitarian crisis” if it is not resolved immediately.Hernandez says the government is working at securing “no-objection certificates” for the Filipinos, which would entail payment of penalties based on their conditions.The process could take “several weeks or even months.”Saudi authorities will have to verify if the Filipinos have pending cases before their final exit visas are granted.The labor department says at least 7,000 OFWs are seeking repatriation.

Pakistan repeatedly denounces US drone strikes, criticizing them as a violation of sovereignty. According to Britain’s Bureau of Investigative Journalism, CIA drone attacks in Pakistan have killed up to 3,587 people since 2004, about 884 of them civilians. At number 5, Taiwan stages its biggest live-fire drill since 2008 in an operation involving more than 7000 troops. The operation, part of an exercise codenamed “Han Kuang 29” takes place in the Penghu Islands in the middle of the 180-kilometer strait separating Taiwan from the Chinese mainland. The army, navy and air force perform drills to prepare for a defense of strategically important islands from a surprise Chinese attack. President Ma Ying-jeou says the live-fire exercise is a reminder of China’s lingering threat. And at number 7,  thousands of Coldplay fans get the chance to be part of a Coldplay-endorsed music video made to show the injustice of land grabbing. Produced jointly with British-based non-profit Oxfam, the video features pictures and video clips of people doing familiar things – like brushing their teeth, or eating – in abnormal settings, like train tracks or underwater. Oxfam received nearly seven thousand submissions from 55 countries around the world.The film was created by director Mat Whitecross to highlight the dislocation thousands of families experience because of land grabs.

But is this assembly enough to make the local comic industry thrive?Jerald Uy reports. Comics geeks, writers, illustrators and even superheroes assembled in this year’s Summer Komikon.This is Mark Rosario, who traveled all the way from Dagupan, Pangasinan to join the convention.He is promoting his self-published autobiographical comics series, “My Wife is Pregnant.” MARK ROSARIO, WRITER, ARTIST: During ‘nung pregnancy ng wife ko, andaming funny experiences, so naisip ko gawan na lang nating komiks.

More than a hundred comics creators came to the comic convention, selling titles as low as P20.But Summer Komikon organizer Jon Zamar still feels there is a lot of work to be done.

Zamar adds that creators should also focus on production and storytelling to improve the quality and entice publishers to print.But while some chose to self-publish comics locally, others found luck abroad.Stephen Segovia started as an artist for the newsstand staple “Funny Komiks.”He wrote and drew “Tomas and Kulas,” a story about a  talking cat and mouse.After working for Funny Komiks, Segovia landed a job with Marvel comics, working on titles like Thor, X-Treme X-Men and Spider-man spin-off series Superior Carnage. STEPHEN SEGOVIA, ARTIST, MARVEL COMICS: I decided to send my stuff to Marvel and to other indie publishers in US. And then fortunately, nabigyan ako ng mga gigs. (I was able to get gigs.)

That’s an additional 5 congressmen and 28 councilors from 2010. The following districts were created: The creation of new districts in Palawan, North Cotabato, and Bukidnon will not result in additional seats in the provincial board. Each of these provinces will still have 10 board members, apportioned to the new number of districts: The new districts in Quezon City, however, will result in 12 new seats in the city council. There will now be 36 city councilors, with each district voting for 6 candidates. RA 6636 states that districts in Quezon City shall elect 6 councilors each. Additional councilors will be elected in localities that were converted from municipalities into cities. The following will each have two additional councilors, or a total of 10: Biñan became a city 3 months before the 2010 elections. But ballots were already prepared then, so its voters had to elect the old number of councilors. Republic Act 6636 states that municipalities shall elect 8 councilors, while cities shall elect 10 councilors. It also states that in the case of cities with their own congressional districts, 12 councilors will be elected. The cities of Bacoor and Imus, both in Cavite, will then have 4 additional councilors each, or a total of 12 each. Bacoor has been divided into two districts, via Republic Act 10160, so each district will elect 6 councilors. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/24547-vettel-grabs-pole-in-rainy-malaysia/","title":"Vettel grabs pole in rainy Malaysia","date":"Mar 23, 2013 10:58 PM PHT","snippet":"World champ Sebastian Vettel snatched pole position for the Malaysian Grand Prix in a dramatic qualifying session.","body":" SEPANG, Malaysia — Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel snatched pole position for the Malaysian Grand Prix Saturday, March 23, in the dying seconds of a dramatic qualifying session which was thrown into chaos by rain. In his final run on a drying track, Vettel stormed across the line in a time of 1min 49.674sec, pipping Ferrari drivers Felipe Massa (1:50.587) and Fernando Alonso (1:50.727) with Mercedes pilot Lewis Hamilton fourth. Red Bull’s Mark Webber and Nico Rosberg of Mercedes will start Sunday’s race from fifth and sixth. Kimi Raikkonen, last week’s winner in Australia, timed seventh but was hit with a three-place grid penalty for impeding Rosberg. McLaren’s Jenson Button will occupy the fourth row alongside Force India’s Adrian Sutil, with McLaren’s new recruit Sergio Perez — second for Sauber in last year’s rain-interrupted race — starting ninth and Raikkonen 10th. ‘Interesting qualifying session’ “It turned into an interesting qualifying session,” said Vettel. “It was quite tricky because some parts of the track were still wet and others were dry, but still all in all a very good session for us. “We managed to save some tyres, which could be crucial tomorrow.” Malaysia’s ever-present tropical showers had disrupted Friday practice, and clouds were again looming ominously as qualifying got under way. With track temperatures at a sizzling 41 degrees Celsius (106 Fahrenheit), Sutil set the pace in Q1 with the Red Bulls of Vettel and Webber trailing in 15th and ninth respectively. Rosberg was leading Q2 when the rain set in, effectively bringing the session to an early halt as the cars returned to the pits — but not before Paul di Resta had twice lost control of his Force India. Overtaking system disabled With the cloudburst quickly easing, the cars switched to intermediate wet-dry tyres for the final qualifying shoot-out and officials disabled the DRS overtaking system in the slippery conditions. Hamilton ran wide on the slick track but soon recovered to post the fastest time, before he was quickly usurped by Rosberg and then Vettel at the top of the standings after six minutes. With two minutes left, Webber raced through to time quickest, a lead which lasted just seconds as Hamilton crossed behind him in a time of 1min 51.699sec, a lap which seemed to have secured his first pole position for Mercedes. But with the chequered flag waving, Alonso bolted over the line with a new fastest time, followed immediately by Vettel who claimed his 38th pole position — and boosted his bid to win a fourth straight world championship. Vettel will hope to improve on last week’s showing in Australia, when he also started in pole position but dropped back to finish third behind Raikkonen and Alonso. “I think if you start in the front you always want to finish there as well. I think it will be a long race,” said the German. Teams will be bracing themselves for more rain on Sunday, after last year’s long storm delay in a race which was eventually won by Alonso. In 2009, heavy rain forced the grand prix’s cancellation after just 31 laps, with Button awarded victory. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/24343-rappler-newscast-march-21-2013/","title":"Rappler Newscast | March 21, 2013","date":"Mar 21, 2013 8:55 PM PHT","snippet":"Abu Sayyaf agree to release Australian Warren Rodwell, US says it will stay out of Sabah issue, North Korea threatens to strike US bases in Japan","body":" Today on Rappler. – Rappler.com Newscast production staff"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/23981-vettel-grabs-pole-for-australian-gp/","title":"Vettel grabs pole for Australian GP","date":"Mar 17, 2013 9:19 AM PHT","snippet":"World champion Sebastian Vettel produced a flying last lap to grab the pole for the Australian F1 Grand Prix in Melbourne.","body":" MELBOURNE, Australia – World champion Sebastian Vettel produced a flying last lap to grab the pole for the Australian Formula One Grand Prix in Melbourne on Sunday, March 16. Vettel trumped Lewis Hamilton’s best time in a Mercedes with his fastest lap of one minute 27.407 seconds, and will start alongside his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber on the front row of the grid. It was the young German’s 37th career pole and sets up the world champion Red Bull team as favourites heading into the season-opening race at Melbourne’s Albert Park street circuit later Sunday. Hamilton, who has switched to Mercedes from McLaren, had looked set to nab the pole when he lowered the best lap time by 3.3secs to 1:28.087 but Vettel, under the hammer, produced a sizzling final lap to trump the Briton. Webber, bidding to join Jack Brabham and Alan Jones as home winners of the Australian GP, finished second quickest with 1:27.827. Felipe Massa was fourth ahead of his Ferrari teammate Fernando Alonso, while German Nico Rosberg was sixth in his Mercedes. Rosberg was quickest in Q2 from Vettel, while Massa and McLaren’s Jenson Button scraped into the final stages of qualifying with flying last laps to beat the cut. Button was 11th but switched back to intermediate tyres and got to fourth fastest, while Massa improved from 12th fastest to grab fifth. The six drivers cut after Q2 were Nico Hulkenberg (Sauber), Adrian Sutil (Force India), Jean-Eric Vergne (Toro Rosso), Daniel Ricciardo (Toro Rosso), Sergio Perez (McLaren) and Valtteri Bottas (Williams). The McLaren team’s gamble on using tyre slicks cost Perez a chance of qualifying higher up the race grid.

Both countries have shown remarkable economic growth against a sluggish global economy, almost catching up with Asia’s other economic powerhouses, China and India. The two neighbors are considered Asia’s rising economic stars, have stock markets that have recently soared to historic highs, and among the most populous in Asia.   In previous years, Indonesia — a nation of about 240 million people, mostly Muslims — has been attracting the second biggest chunk of foreign direct investments (US$19.2 billion in 2012) flowing into Southeast Asia, next to Singapore’s $54 billion). The Philippines — a nation of 100 million people, mostly Christians — remained a laggard, capturing only $1.5 billion. With a big push for a credit rating upgrade this 2013 for the Philippines — currently at one level below investment grade — the Philippines is hoping to be in the same level as Indonesia, which has been bumped up to investment grade.   Fast growing economies  “Indonesia has been growing consistently for the last 25 to 30 years. Even during the financial crisis, there continues to be a really high growth so, if there is any single country we would compete with, it would be Indonesia,” said Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio M Balisacan at a recent press briefing anouncing the Philippine’s 2012 economic performance. The Philippines grew 6.6% in 2012, surpassing the government’s own target of 5% to 6% for 2012. The country also registered a 4th quarter growth of 6.8%.  This growth, which was well above the expansion of 3.9% in 2011, boosted the country’s position among its ASEAN neighboring putting it on par with Indonesia, which grew 6.5% in 2011. In the 3rd quarter of 2012, the Philippines recorded a growth of 7.1%, replacing Indonesia as the second-fastest in Asia next to China’s 7.7% and the fastest in Southeast Asia. Indonesia, which dropped down to 3rd position, registered a growth of 6.2%. While Indonesia is due to announce its GDP data on February 5, the country’s central bank predicts that Indonesia’s economy could grow by 6.3% in 2012, slowed down by weak export performance caused by the global economic slowdown — an experience the Philippines shares. ‘New tigers’ In a recent report, business news site Market Watch christened the Philippines and Indonesia as “the new tigers” or economies that have been overlooked in the past and are now “poised to drive future growth and grab more economic power.”  “In an economically vibrant Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines stand out as the region’s ‘New Tigers’ with the potential to leave a bigger imprint on global growth for years to come while the developed world struggles with excess debt and traditional regional heavyweights China and India lose momentum,” said the report.  To view the full UNCTAD report on Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), please click here. Market Watch stated that the two countries shared similar characteristics that have helped boost it economic ranking among its neighbors;  Best performers, borrowers to lendersPhilippine and Indonesian stocks have been advancing to all-time highs. On Friday, February 1, the Philippine Stock Exchange Index climbed 1.21% to 6,318.61, breaching the 6,300 milestone and closing the week at another historic high — the 13th this 2013. The Jakarta Composite Index rose 1.4% to 4,517.82. The two indexes were the biggest gainers on February 1 among Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. “Indonesia and the Philippines are considered among the most attractive markets in Southeast Asia because of their improving economy and strong consumer base,” Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. told Bloomberg. Proving their full recovery from the Asian Financial Crisis, Indonesia and the Philippines have also both come full circle. Once borrowers of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), both recently became lenders. Part of this growth has put down to the reforms implemented by the current administrations. Presidents Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in Indonesia and Benigno Aquino in the Philippines have both won upgrades from Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service in the past year as they pledged to contain their budget deficits, fight corruption and woo investment to spur economic growth. In Indonesia, the nation’s parliament approved a land-acquisition bill in December that will allow Yudhoyono’s administration to accelerate road, port and airport projects. In the Philippines, Aquino is seeking $16 billion of investments in projects including roads in the capital and airports in the provinces to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure. World renowned economist Nouriel Roubini have cited these reforms when he favored the Philippines and Indonesia over China and India, current members of the so-called BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China). “They are actually doing more in terms of structural reform,” Roubini said. “The economies are growing more than 6%,” even higher than the average 5% global growth the developing economies are projected to grow this 2013, and way faster than the 1% estimated pace of growth for the advanced nations. Roubini has promoted the Indonesia’s credit rating upgrade, and believes the Philippines deserves to be among the A-lister countries, too.  Investment grade In Southeast Asia, only 4 of the 10 ASEAN member states currently enjoy investment grade status: Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the recently upgraded Indonesia. Indonesia received investment grade status from two of the 3 major credit rating agencies: Fitch Ratings in December 2011 and Moody’s in January 2012 . According to studies conducted by Moody’s and Fitch’s, it is historically more difficult to reach an investment grade when a country’s GDP per capita falls under the $3,000 range. Indonesia’s GDP per capita is $3,508 in 2011, while the Philippines’ is still way below the mark of $2,223 in the same year. “I have come to the conclusion that the rating to investment grade is certainly warranted and decision should be formally taken this year,” Roubini said during the Philippine Investment Summit 2013 in Makati City. “I hope that rating agencies will understand that sooner rather than later… and an upgrade will occur in the next few months.” Getting an investment grade from credit rating agencies encourage more investments to the country, and in turn, supports economic growth. Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings rates the Philippines one notch below investment grade: BB+ with a positive outlook (S&P), and BB+ with a stable outlook (Fitch). Moody’s Investors Service rates the Philippines Ba1, also a notch below investment grade, with a positive outlook.  The right direction Is one country better than the other? “In economics, it’s not a zero sum game,” replied Roubini. “It’s not like private business in which one will be successful in one sector and the other will lose. Both can successful.” Roubini has been widely quoted for favoring the Philippines and Indonesia over China and India, current members of the so-called BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China). “Investors are looking at the long-term prospects of the country. They look at macroeconomic policies [and] financial environment if these are sound, political risks reduced, policies, regulatory environment not changing rapidly. Countries build reputation over time. Overall, I would say certainly Philippines and other emerging economies are going to the right direction.” In the same investment summit, businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan, who chairs Hong Kong-based conglomerate First Pacific Ltd, was asked which country he prefers, considering the group’s stakes in both countries. He shared a recent conversation with a large private equity fund manager. “He noted that there is election this year (in Indonesia), so there is uncertainty on successor of SBY….He also noted that there are more happening in infrastructure investment in Philippines than in Indonesia. In his eyes, the Philippines compares favorably than Indonesia. And I tend to agree.” Pangilinan also stresed that the Philippines has to keep this momentum going. “I agree that governance have improved a lot, prospects have improved a lot. It is incumbent upon both the government and private sector to ensure that the perception is supported by fundamentals. You cannot defy gravity for long. You have to make sure that performance catches up with perception rather quickly. “Otherwise, when other economies — China, Thailand, other countries within the region — will recover in due course, then there will be more competition with respect to investment dollars. We should be ready for that,” he stressed.  As both the Philippines and Indonesia continue to grow nearly on par with each other, investors have been told to keep their eyes on the upcoming powerhouses. – with research from Lean Santos/Rappler.com Update here: Philippines vs Indonesia: Which is ‘better’?"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/20679-rappler-newscast-january-29-2013/","title":"Rappler Newscast | January 29, 2013","date":"Jan 29, 2013 8:53 PM PHT","snippet":"Catholic bishops say those who voted for the RH bill are unfit for public office. | RH advocate Carlos Celdran will appeal his guilty verdict for offending religious feelings. | A new photo of kidnapped Australian Warren Rodwell held by the Abu Sayyaf is posted on Facebook.","body":" Today on Rappler.

Entrepreneurs can take their cue from these 7 lessons shared by Asia's best","body":" MANILA, Philippines – All businesses start small, but what makes or breaks them depends largely on the entrepreneur behind them.  At the APEC SME Summit on Sunday, January 20, prominent entrepreneurs in Asia who have made it big locally and globally shared how they found new ways of doing things and fulfill their potential to become trailblazers.  (Click here for Rappler’s live blog of the APEC SME Summit.)  Here are 7 key lessons the speakers shared during the summit: 1. Passion is key Keeping the passion to pursue the business even through numerous challenges stood out as a common trait among the summit speakers. Cher Wang, the chair of Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC Corp. and microchip maker VIA group, stressed how she banked on this to stay the course even when there were bumps.  Wang shared that, when she was just starting, she designed computer chips in her living room and lugged around the fragile computer chips she made while commuting. She eventually pursued her dream of creating a device that would act as a phone, a computer, a calculator.  HTC’s rise to the top ranks of the smartphone sector has led Forbes to name Wang, a billionaire, as one of the world’s most powerful women. HTC has also been hailed as the “pride of Taiwan” for being the first from the country to establish an international brand and beat Finnish phone maker Nokia to become the world’s 3rd largest mobile phone maker by market value. 2. Learn from mistakes Tony Tan Caktiong, the visionary behind every child’s fast food craving, Jollibee, shared that mistakes are inevitably part of the process to achieve “big dreams.” “If you dream big and put your dreams into action you will inevitably make mistakes. But don’t be scared to make mistakes. Just be quick in realizing the mistake and correcting them as best and as fast as you can. Learn from each mistake and it will not be a waste of your time,” shared the man behind the homegrown food giant.  Caktiong said the brands that they started but failed to grow included Mary’s Chicken and Copenhagen ice cream. Lots of research went into these brands but the products that were eventually launched were far from what was originally tested. These flops, however, did not deter the group from moving on. Jollibee is now a multinational with over 2,000 stores in various locations in the Philippines, China, and the United States.  Vincent Lo, the founder and chairman of Hong Kong-based firm construction company Shui On Group, said he, too, committed mistakes. These include making an investment in an amusement park in mainland China just because there was no existing amusement park. “They have a lot of other alternatives as the economy is growing and developing,” he noted. There was another mistake: he was managing the business long-distance. “Every society is so different. You cannot really make decisions thousands of miles away. You need to know your customers and what they really want and how you can serve them best.” He learned his lesson, and now spends more time in mainland China so that he can keep up to date with the rapidly changing market. 3. Don’t be a bystander Both Caktiong and Lo also shared how previous decisions became their their turning point.     Caktiong shared how his team decided to pursue the transformation of the business, which started as a small ice cream store in 1975, even when they learned that global fastfood giant McDonalds was about to enter the Philippines. Several friends told him to back out since it would be difficult to outdo McDonalds. “This was a moment of truth for us. If I had not [persisted], I would have sold out the business right then and I would not be standing in front you of today. I might just be flipping burgers for you-know-who,” Caktiong said, referring to McDonalds. Lo, on the other hand, said his efforts to go against what is popular paid off when he embarked on a real estate project with the Hong Kong government at a time when the market was depressed.  When Lo wanted to preserve traditional architectural styles through Xintiandi, a major shopping and entertainment hub in Shanghai, nobody wanted to lend him US$175 million. Everybody thought he was crazy.  But he pushed on, invested time and effort, until Xintiandi became a new landmark for Shanghai in China. This also thrust the Shui On Group into the limelight.  “You have to learn to create opportunities for yourself and you have to be able to grab hold of the opportunities. Most importantly you have to do it with passion,” Lo stressed.  4. Invest in education  Education is the most important ingredient in becoming an entrepreneur, stressed Diosdado “Dado” Banatao, the managing partner of semiconductor firm Tallwood Venture Capital and a Filipino engineering genius.  A Silicon Valley visionary, Banatao highlighted how a good education can be a springboard to a good career or to greater success in life. Banatao, who has a well-known rags-to-riches story among entrepreneurs, considered school his first challenge in life. Banatao, the son of a rice farmer and housekeeper, grew up in a farming town in Cagayan Valley Province, and used to walk barefoot to school. He eventually graduated cum laude with an Electrical Engineering degree from Mapua University and obtained a Masters in Computer Science at Stanford University. While he was in the US, he combined his academic stripes with passion, innovative spirit, and a competitive drive to outdo others. He initially worked with leading-edge technology companies before putting up his own ventures.    Winston Damarillo, the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of cloud management firm Morphlabs said that, while getting an education is key, carrying on those values after graduation is as important. He shared that when his family’s business encountered financial troubles, his parents never gave up and continued to send him to De La Salle.  He carried the values he learned from school and stood by them even when he, too, met challenges along the way. He intially wanted to work for giant companies which didn’t want to hire him, like Intel and IBM. He continued making software and set up several major IT companies, including Gluecode Software, which IBM eventually acquired.  Recounting how his group withstood challenges, he shared, “If I can’t work with Intel through my diploma, I will create my own software and bring it to them.” He believed in open source.  5. Believe in Pinoys Damarillo also shared his frustrations, including doubting whether Filipinos can think out-of-the-box.  He said there was a time when he described himself as Chinese instead of Filipino, but he has since been proven wrong. One of his ventures with Banatao, Hack2Hatch, invests in and mentors budding Filipino entrepreneurs. “We put up Hack2Hatch and we’re seeing something that’s now a phenomenon…I’m really excited about whats happening in the Philippines.” Damarillo added that mentoring reinspires him.  He said Filipinos have a high emotional quotient (EQ) and are “great in designing. If you combine that with tech, we have a great opportunity…When you’re creating software, 99% of your ingredient is human capital.” Anna Meloto-Wilk, co-founder and president of Gandang Kalikasan Inc., the maker of Human Nature, an all-natural Philippine-made bath and beauty line, echoed Damarillo’s insights into her countrymen. “The Filipino has the potential to be world-class. We just need to guide them in all the technical and operational details to be able to stabilize and sustain these start-up businesses,” she shared. With an investment in a management system that tracks how the business operates, her and her sister’s venture grew from a small business out of organic bath and beauty products into one that is now conquering local and global markets. The business also provides livelihood opportunities to poor communities where they buy indigenous raw materials used for their products.  6. Be brave Sheila Marcelo, the founder and CEO of www.care.com, shared how the difficulty of juggling her studies, starting a family, and managing a home in the US when she was 20 made her realize there was poor access to care is in her host country. In the Philippines, it was easy with readily available househelpers – something frowned upon abroad. But she wanted to change that. She did through technology.  Marcelo revolutionized the way people obtain access to healthcare through the online caregiver recruitment agency, www.care.com. With the technology in place, the information that reached her about the Philippines being a big source of caregivers in the world, only made the business more appealing to her.  “Some people ask me ‘why weren’t you here 20 years ago,’ most of it is because of technology. How many people were comfortable going online to use this service? Care[.com] was not ready then. We weren’t as comfortable trying to find care for our loved ones,” Marcelo said.  Technology really helped change the world and Diane Wang, the founder of DHGate.com, experienced that first hand. She said DHGate has seen countless e-commerce transactions in more than 200 countries worldwide.  Through e-commerce, Wang said, small and medium enterprises can find a greater leverage in growing their businesses. Many SMEs are doing better business now with e-commerce and more are expected to join in.  “E-commerce is already empowering SMEs everyday. It’s not the future, it’s here today,” Wang said.  7. Have a big heart Jaime Aristitle B. Alip, the founder and Managing Director of the Center for Agriculture and Rural Development Mutually Reinforcing Institutions (CARD MRI), and Ismawan Bambang, founder and chair of Bina Swadaya in Indonesia, proudly said they are in the business of poverty alleviation.  Alip said he started CARD with P20 and a typewriter. Nobody wanted to help him turn his vision of putting up a bank for the poor a reality simply because it went against conventional wisdom.  That did not stop him from pursuing his dream. In 2010, he started to extend microfinance services to women who, he said, are more likely to use the funds for family and entrepreneurial needs.  This formula worked. Repayment was high at 99.35%. As of November 2012, CARD has assisted 1.8 million and insured 7.8 million Filipinos.  “My business is poverty eradication. It’s inter-generational. It take 5 years to bring them out of poverty and a further 5 to 7 years to establish themselves fully out of poverty,” Alip said. “Our secret? We only give loans for women.” It is the same story for Bambang who heads one of the largest NGOs in Indonesia. Bambang said helping microenterprises in Indonesia, which comprise 92.04% of businesses, was not easy especially if only a handful of people come together to help.  “If you do everything by yourself, you wont make any impact. But if you do things with others, the impact will be beyond your expectation,” Bambang said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/19442-rappler-newscast-january-9-2013/","title":"Rappler Newscast | January 9, 2013","date":"Jan 9, 2013 8:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Senate President Enrile confirms he refused to give cash gifts to 4 of his critics in the Senate. | President Aquino rejects calls for a total gun ban. | The Philippine National Police fires cops involved in the alleged shootout in Quezon.","body":" Today on Rappler.   Story 1: ENRILE’S ‘CASH GIFTS’ EXCLUDE 4 CRITICSSenate President Juan Ponce Enrile confirms he excluded 4 senators from the additional funds he distributed before the Christmas break.

He says what is needed is better enforcement of the law and higher penalties for irresponsible gun owners.A gun enthusiast himself, Aquino defends his right to own a gun.He says he was a victim of violence in 1987, when he narrowly escaped an ambush by rebel soldiers who mounted a coup against his mother, then President Corazon Aquino.Aquino also stresses how the government is running after private armed groups, which he says are the biggest threats to peace and order. BENIGNO AQUINO III, PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT: So I think, a lot of us will agree with the basic premise na ‘yung outlaw will be one of the first or first groups that will say, thank you na madidisarmahan ‘yung law abiding citizen dahil mas madali na silang mabiktima…It sounds nice, total gun ban, but the total does not happen because the outlaw will not. So we will not stop in our pursuit to follow these people who are outside of the law and get them before the bars of justice. Story 5: PNP SACKS QUEZON POLICE CHIEF, COPSThe Philippine National Police fires the police chief of Quezon and officials involved in an alleged shootout in Atimonan, Quezon on Sunday.The intelligence unit under Supt. Hansel Marantan and Quezon police chief Senior Supt Valeriano de Leon are relieved from their posts and ordered to face the National Bureau of Investigation.On Wednesday, Interior Secretary Mar Roxas says the police violated rules during the incident.

There doesn’t seem to be any method to the madness.  Frenzied worshippers climb over one another to grab at what they believe is their chance at a miracle. DEVON WONG, REPORTING: I’m here in Quiapo to witness my first Feast Day of the Black Nazarene. It’s a daunting spectacle that looks more like a stampede than an act of worship to the outside eye. But for the devotees, suffering through the Nazarene is worn as a badge of honor.Mark Puyao became a devotee three years ago when he was invited by his friends to the event. He says he will continue to come because he believes the Nazarene hears his prayers. MARK PUYAO, DEVOTEE: All my prayers are answered because of Him. And He gives my family good health. The strong faith of devotees keeps them returning to the event each year. For some, it’s a family tradition. Gloria Kayunda has attended the Nazarene since 1979 to pay homage to the statue. It may seem like an extreme religious ritual to some, but Gloria disagrees. GLORIA KAYUNDA, DEVOTEE: Us Filipinos are not like that. If it’s about faith, it’s about faith for us.(What are you praying for this year?) To have our own house, because we were affected by typhoon Ondoy. We live far. We come from Santa Maria Bulacan. We’re hoping to have a relocation.  It’s the individual hopes and prayers surging into a collective active of piety that makes the Black Nazarene a powerful event. It may look like chaos from here, but perhaps it makes more sense to someone from a higher place.Devon Wong, Rappler, Quiapo.

Story 1: AQUINO SIGNS HISTORIC SIN TAX BILL INTO LAWPresident Benigno Aquino signs the sin tax bill into law Thursday, ending a grueling battle to reform the Philippines’ excise tax system.Aquino says the law is an early Christmas gift to millions of Filipinos.BENIGNO AQUINO III, PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT: Sa araw pong ito, nilagdaan natin, sa wakas — ulitin ko lang po, sa wakas —ang isang batas [applause] na magsisilbing maagang Pamasko sa milyun-milyong Pilipino—mga Pilipinong masasaklaw sa abot-kamay nang Universal Health Care program, mga Pilipinong makikinabang sa mga bagong klinika at ospital na mapopondohan at maipapatayo, mga Pilipinong maililihis sa bisyo ng paninigarilyo at labis na pag-inom. Batas na po ang ipinaglaban nating Sin Tax Reform Act.The law imposes higher taxes on tobacco and alcohol.It will generate revenues of roughly P34 billion in the first year of implementation that will be spent for the universal health care program and tobacco farmers’ livelihood.Passing the measure is a milestone for Aquino.Efforts to restructure the excise tax system never made it out of the committee level in Congress in 15 years.Aquino, who certified the sin tax bill urgent last November, thanks lawmakers who helped push the bill.BENIGNO AQUINO III, PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT: Maraming nag-isip na imposibleng maipasa ang Sin Tax Reform Bill: malakas ang kalaban; maingay, organisado, at malalim ang bulsa ng mga kumukontra.In the Senate, the bill faced opposition from Senators Ralph Recto and Bongbong Marcos, who say it would displace tobacco farmers and encourage smuggling.Recto resigned as ways and means committee chair after criticism he submitted a watered-down version that will raise only P15 billion in revenues.The Senate approved a substitute bill that seeks to raise P40 billion, P20 billion less than the Aquino administration’s target.At the bicameral conference committee, debates center on the burden-sharing between tobacco and alcohol in generating the revenues.

Story 3: CU: CONVERGENCE IS FUTURE OF MOBILEGLOBE CEO Ernest Cu talks about the future of the country’s 2nd largest telecommunications company, in the face of shifting consumer demands and the technological landscape.Katherine Visconti reports.ERNEST CU, GLOBE CEO: The service you provide is closest to people’s hearts. There is no alternative, we have to be on all the time, it is a very challenging industry. And I look at it, peoples habits about consuming water and power has not changed. But people’s habits about how they use the service is changing.The internet is changing media and telecommunications as we know them.The man steering the second largest telco in the country through the uncertain times is Globe CEO Ernest Cu. Partnerships are central to Globe’s strategy. Cu is already in talks with the country’s biggest media group ABS-CBN. There are no talks yet with the second biggest — GMA 7 — but Globe isn’t ruling this out. ERNEST CU, GLOBE CEO: We are always open to everyone speaking with us. There is no exclusivity right? Partnering with a major network will help Globe in its convergence strategy to marry TV content with the vast distribution network of a telco. Rival telco PLDT chair Manuel Pangilinan once joked that Globe is copying their convergence strategy after buying the third biggest, TV5.ERNEST CU, GLOBE CEO: When you say it’s a copycat strategy it’s kind of interesting because every telco in the world is trying to do it. And the United States was actually the very first one to start doing it. PLDT acquired another rival telco in 2011 and now has twice as many mobile subscribers as Globe and nearly twice as many broadband consumers.Cu says Globe is comfortable with being number 2 and is realistic about spending so much for market share.ERNEST CU, GLOBE CEO: Yeah at some point you have to ask yourself what it is going to cost you to go to 50%. There is always a cost. But all I can say is, we will try to drive our business as hard as we can with post paid leading the way. Mobile is disruptive. We’re dealing with it by accepting it.

If the signal is crappy maybe we can improve on how we relate and pacify customers.ERNEST CU, GLOBE CEO: On the customer service side, on the front line, we’ve actually been working very hard at this. The first part we tried to solve was people able to call in. In the past it was difficult to call in to Globe so we solved that issue by fixing some IVR systems, by moving people off to different channels like self-serve, and also putting a social network team to answer complaints on Twitter or chat with you…People should start to see the difference sometime in the first or second quarter.MARIA RESSA: The perception is Globe is stable, has been around, trustworthy and at the same time stodgier than your competition, that Smart is more aggressive. Is this true?ERNEST CU:I think it’s changed in the last 36 months or so, at least that’s what we feel, of course everyone will have a different opinion.

The Garcias don’t buy it.They plan to ask the courts to stop the suspension.PABLO JOHN GARCIA, CEBU REP, 3RD DISTRICT: LP is showing brute force. This is martial law, emphasis on Mar. JC Gov Magpale is not just acting governor. She is overacting governor.Rallying her own supporters, Magpale says Garcia should follow an order that is final and executory.With Palace and police backing, Magpale also takes control.For her, being Roxas’ partymate and the sister of Aquino classmate Cabinet Secretary Jose Rene Almendras are not the issue.AGNES MAGPALE, ACTING CEBU GOVERNOR: I’ve been in politics for 20 years. My brother is 18 years my junior. To drag his name is unfair. This decision is long overdue.Magpale is leaving it up to the police to deal with Garcia.The police say if the suspended governor continues her defiance, she may just force them to literally remove her from office.AYEE MACARAIG, REPORTING: Who is in charge and how long will the situation last?

BARACK OBAMA, US PRESIDENT: There’s no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence in our society. The fact that we can’t prevent every act of violence doesn’t mean we can’t steadily reduce the violence, and prevent the very worst violence.And at number 10, Beware a sophisticated new campaign out to get your private information.

Story 8: THE wRap: YOUR WORLD IN ONE READAt number 4, Egyptian riot police clash against thousands of protesters gathered outside the Presidential palace in Cairo, angry about what they say call a dictatorial rule by President Muhammed Morsi. The President flees the palace through a side gate.  The palace is now  cordoned off with a barbed wire. Last month, Morsi put in place a new law that would protect Presidential decrees from being overrun.The law also protected a council that will draft a new constitution.Morsi calls for a referendum on the draft constitution on December 15 but opponents say he is rushing the matter. At number 5, Iran claims it captured a US drone that entered Iranian airspace over the Persian gulf. A US defense official denies this, saying it’s accounted for all US Navy drones operating in the Middle East. Iranian officials identify the drone as a Scan Eagle, an unmanned aircraft with a wingspan of about 10 feet capable of flying for 24 hours without refueling. It’s used in the military for surveillance operations. At number 6, US President Barack Obama says he is willing to consider new options to avoid the fiscal cliff, but he says any deal should include higher taxes for the rich. Republicans criticize a previous plan by the Obama administration, calling it a step backwards in terms of negotiations. Obama criticizes a proposal by House Republicans that includes $800-B in additional tax revenues but didn’t raise tax rates on upper income Americans. The President says he understands the need to be flexible, adding, “I’m not going to get 100%” but insisted a deal would have to include increased taxes for Americans that make over $250,000. And at number 9, Texting celebrates its 20th birthday on Monday. On Dec 3, 1991, British engineer Neil Papworth sent the first text, “Merry Christmas” to the mobile phone of Vodafone executive Richard Jarvis. At that time it was intended as an easy way for staff within a company to send messages to each other. One year later, Nokia introduced GSM handsets that supported the Short Message Service. The rest as we know is history. SMS usage continues to increase worldwide even as more smartphone owners use competing services like BlackBerry Messenger and Apple’s iMessage. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/16883-egypt-s-leader-under-pressure-as-protesters-decry-power-grab/","title":"Egypt’s leader under pressure as protesters decry power grab","date":"Nov 28, 2012 11:17 AM PHT","snippet":"Tens of thousands have packed Tahrir Square to protest a power grab by Mohamed Morsi, piling pressure on Egypt's Islamist president as he faces his most divisive crisis since taking power in June","body":" CAIRO, Egypt – Tens of thousands have packed Tahrir Square to protest a power grab by Mohamed Morsi, piling pressure on Egypt’s Islamist president as he faces his most divisive crisis since taking power in June. The huge turnout in the iconic square in the heart of Cairo, as well as in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and most of Egypt’s 27 provinces on Tuesday, November 27, marked the largest mobilization yet against the president. Elsewhere in the country, protesters enraged by Morsi’s decision to grant himself sweeping powers attacked three regional headquarters belonging to the president’s Muslim Brotherhood movement, a security official said. In Tahrir, protesters who had voted for Morsi in the election joined forces with die-hard opponents of the Islamist. “I’m here to protest Morsi’s autocratic decisions,” said Mohammed Rashwan, an engineering graduate who voted for Morsi in the country’s first presidential election since a popular uprising toppled Hosni Mubarak last year. Three people have died in clashes since Morsi decreed his new powers. A rival rally in Cairo by the Muslim Brotherhood on Tuesday in support of the president was called off to “avoid potential unrest” but that has done little to abate the split between Morsi’s supporters and foes. Meanwhile US officials said Washington was closely following the drama unfolding in Egypt, with a warning that Cairo could put vast amounts of international aid at stake if it veers back off the democratic course. The situation was evolving, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. “I think we don’t yet know what the outcome of those are going to be. But that’s a far cry from an autocrat just saying, my way or the highway,” she said. Despite her carefully worded statement on Tuesday, the US embassy in Cairo seemed to suggest that Egypt was indeed on the path to a new dictatorship. “The Egyptian people made clear in the January 25th revolution that they have had enough of dictatorship,” the embassy tweeted in a message on its Twitter account. Nuland stressed that “we want to see Egypt continuing on a reform path to ensure that any money forthcoming from the IMF truly supports a stabilization and a revitalization of a dynamic economy based on market principles.” The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said Egypt can still get its $4.8 billion loan, agreed last week, despite the turmoil as long as there is “no major change” in its reform commitments. The Egyptian protesters are angry at the decree that Morsi announced last Thursday allowing him to “issue any decision or law that is final and not subject to appeal”, which effectively placed him beyond judicial oversight. The decree put him on a collision course with the judiciary and consolidated the long-divided opposition which accuses him of taking on dictatorial powers. The demonstrations come a day after Morsi stuck by his decree after a meeting with the country’s top judges aimed at defusing the crisis. There has been “no change to the constitutional declaration”, presidential spokesman Yasser Ali told reporters at the end of the meeting. But he added Morsi sought to clarify that any irrevocable decisions apply only to issues related “to his sovereign powers” and stressed the temporary nature of the decree. The head of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) — the Brotherhood’s political arm — said the meeting between Morsi and the judges had been “fruitful”. But judges said the crisis was not over. “The meeting failed,” Judge Abdel Rahman Bahlul, who attended the talks, told the independent daily Al-Masry Al-Youm. “We cannot say this is the end of the crisis between the judiciary and the presidency,” another judge who attended the talks, Judge Ahmed Abdel Rahman, told the paper. A judicial source told AFP that even if immunity were limited to sovereign powers, “which appears to be a compromise, there are still concerns that the text itself remains unchanged”. The decree bars the courts from dissolving a controversial panel that is drafting a new constitution. Liberals, leftists and church leaders have already walked out of the Islamist-dominated panel charging that it fails to represent all Egyptians. – Haitham-El-Tabei, Agence France-Presse"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/13776-philippines-and-indonesia-are-the-new-tigers-say-analysts/","title":"Philippines and Indonesia: the new ‘tigers’","date":"Oct 8, 2012 9:35 AM PHT","snippet":"Market Watch christened the Philippines and Indonesia as \"The New Tigers\" or economies that have been overlooked in the past and are now \"poised to drive future growth and grab more economic power\"","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Step aside economic powerhouses of the past, and get ready to share the spotlight. In a special report, business news site Market Watch christened the Philippines and Indonesia as “the new tigers” or economies that have been overlooked in the past and are now “poised to drive future growth and grab more economic power.” “In an economically vibrant Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines stand out as the region’s ‘New Tigers’ with the potential to leave a bigger imprint on global growth for years to come while the developed world struggles with excess debt and traditional regional heavyweights China and India lose momentum,” said the report. Market Watch said it selected Indonesia and the Philippines because of several shared characteristics: Once plagued by inefficiencies and corruption, the Philippines has been ignored by investors in the past. But recently, several analysts have given the country their vote of confidence, heralding it as the next breakout nation, the strongest and safest place for funds in the region, and Asia’s bright spot. According to Market Watch, neighbors Indonesia and the Philippines have come full circle. Once borrowers of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), both recently became lenders.  This 2012, they each pledged USD$1 billion to IMF’s crisis fund mostly for wobbly European countries, after relying on the same body to bail them out during the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s, right after Asian economies stalled in their original quests to become ‘Tiger’ economies.  The borrower-to-lender transition is only one example that shows how both countries are righting their economic ships. Investors are encouraged to keep their eyes on the Philippines and Indonesia as the countries set sail, especially as traditional economies sputter and slowdown. Why Philippines may finally take off The mood in the Philippines is upbeat, explained Market Watch. After a lackluster 2011, the country has one of the fastest growth rates in Southeast Asia. While inflation and high food prices remain a concern in other Asian countries, the Philippines has avoided that problem. The country’s average inflation is at the low end of the central bank’s 3% to 5% target, coming out to just 3.2% over the first 9 months. And an Asian Development Bank (ADB) report on inflation and food prices showed that, while the retail cost of rice increased in 10 other developing Asian countries, the price of the staple food actually decreased nearly 1% in the Philippines between 2010 and 2011.   Under President Aquino’s government, the budget deficit was cut, and he promised to bring it down to 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2013 from 3.9% when he took office in 2010. The article noted that while some view Aquino’s fiscal moves as prudent, others believe he is too cautious with spending — a vital ingredient for fueling a developing economy. Still, Market Watch said, “With low debt and a government working hard to get its financial position in order, the Philippines represents the opposite of Europe.” The local stock market has also become more attractive amid uncertainty in former safe havens. Though relatively small and expensive by Asian standards, the Philippine Stock Exchange has grown an impressive 24.4% year-to-date. An investment upgrade for sovereign debt issues is in reach now more than ever. “Any concern about the small size of the Indonesian and Philippines markets has been put aside in the past few years by investors in part seeking safety from European debt turmoil by buying into ‘stable stocks and stable markets,'” Khiem Do, head of Asian multi asset at Barings Investment Management, told Market Watch. The Philippines has been relatively sheltered from the global economic slowdown. Filipinos abroad continue to pump money back into the local economy in the form of remittances, which are estimated to account for 9% of GDP. Though growth has slowed, each year remittances hit another record high. Market Watch pointed out that a prospect that is even brighter than remittances is the homegrown call center industry. After all, the Philippines boasts of a young, ready-to-work, English-speaking population — perfect employees for the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. “Revenue from the industry, which employs almost 650,000, accounts for about 5% of GDP. At the current annual growth rate of about 25%, analysts estimate industry revenues will top remittances within 5 years,” wrote Market Watch. People are constantly praised as the Philippines’ best asset. Market Watch pointed out that the Filipino people have the potential to help the country unlock tourism as a key to future growth. Challenges ahead The country seems ready to make a new name for itself in the global arena but several challenges threaten to hold the country back. Market Watch points to a few: low infrastructure spending, red tape for potential growth sectors like mining, a higher cost base for manufacturing and not enough foreign investments. Not solving those issues will stifle the country’s next high growth industries. “The key reason tourism is underperforming in the Philippines is infrastructure,” Credit Suisse economist Santitarn Sathirathai told Market Watch. “A bigger tourism sector would help absorb labor in its swelling population, as it nears 100 million. Rapid population growth has not been matched by infrastructure expansion. Aging roads and inadequate airports have frustrated economic development and made getting around difficult for visitors,” said the news site. Big-ticket infrastructure projects have been delayed as the government takes extra measures to insure transparent and fair bidding. For years the country has needed new infrastructure and the rollbacks exacerbate existing problems, like the capital’s notorious traffic jams. Southeast Asia broker CLSA told Market Watch that since the 1990s, “infrastructure spending in the Philippines has averaged around 1.8% of gross domestic product — well below the regional average and the World Bank’s target of 5%.” Market Watch also highlighted mining as an industry that could help raise the Philippines’ economic prospects. “Beyond tourism, mining is another potential growth driver for the Philippines. The country is rich in minerals including copper, gold and nickel, but development of the mining industry has been stalled by political resistance and layers of red tape,” said Market Watch. “Those obstacles are likely to push the meaningful development of the country’s mining sector out by at least 5 to 10 years,” it added. The Philippines is the 5th most mineral-rich country in the world thanks to its large supply of gold, nickel, copper, and chromite. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau estimated that US$840 billion worth of mineral wealth lies untapped beneath the ground. The Aquino administration has tried to provide mining firms with new clear guidelines only to receive a backlash of negative comments from industry players. “Regardless of which industries the Philippines seeks to develop, international backing will be crucial,” said Market Watch. International funding may not be too far off with investors eyeing the country with so much renewed interest. However, the country has been praised for its potential before, only to fall flat. From its reputation as “the Pearl of the Orient,” the Philippines dropped in international esteem until it was known as the “Sick Man of Asia.”  Now the country has the tools it needs to be a standout economy: low debt, a stable government, mineral wealth, a strong stock market and a large youthful population. It just has to unleash them. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/13275-rappler-newscast-september-28-2012/","title":"Rappler Newscast | September 28, 2012","date":"Sep 28, 2012 8:52 PM PHT","snippet":"The government suspends its mining rules. | Senate President Enrile presents his version of history. | Human Rights Watch hits the cybercrime law for giving authorities excessive powers to shut down websites.","body":" Today on Rappler.

The memoir was published by ABS-CBN Publishing, which is owned by the Lopez family, one of the families whose businesses suffered under martial law. ABS-CBN was one of the first media companies shut down by the Marcos government after the 1972 declaration of martial law.Enrile was then defense minister.In his opening speech, Lopez patriarch Oscar Lopez explains ABS-CBN’s role. “Why did ABS-CBN publish his autobiography when the network was the earliest casualty of the martial law regime?”“I have realized that it helps to see, as well, the humanity of those of us who lived through that horrible time, including those from the opposite side of the street.”President Benigno Aquino III, whose parents and family were also martial law victims, was Enrile’s guest of honor at the launch. He welcomed Enrile’s memoir.He says, “In a democracy, where thoughts can contend, we must embrace the challenge and the opportunity those competing ideas represent.”In the book, Enrile talks about his childhood, his search for his father, his struggle to get an education, his relationship with the past 6 Philippine presidents, and his role in the martial law years.Enrile also writes about the supposed animosity between him and former First Lady Imelda Marcos who -quote- “singled him out as their rival to succeed Marcos”, as the strongman’s health deteriorated.Mrs Marcos was present at the book launch. Is Enrile’s book trying to revise history?He says “If there is a revision, they can write their own version. As I said, I don’t have the monopoly of truth.”Book editor Nelson Navarro says it’s revisionist in the sense that it is different from the “yellow filtering” of what happened.” JUAN PONCE ENRILE, AUTHOR, ‘JUAN PONCE ENRILE: A MEMOIR’: Writing my memoirs, my memoir, proved to be an emotional roller-coaster ride for me.

In Cavite, the fight for the 2013 elections is heating up.It’s a free for all zone where both the administration and its ally are competing. President Benigno Aquino III himself jumpstarts the province’s heated rivalry between the political families of the Remullas and the Maliksis. He and Liberal Party stalwarts attend a proclamation rally Monday, September 24 in Imus to endorse Rep Ayong Maliksi for governor and his running mate Jay Lacson.Incoming Interior Secretary Mar Roxas and new Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya accompany the President.Cavite was solidly behind Aquino in 2010.The next day, another huge gathering, this time in Kawit.Sen Bong Revilla’s party Lakas-CMD joins forces with local party Partido Magdalo to back incumbent Cavite Gov Jonvic Remulla and his son, Jolo Revilla who is running for vice governor.Remulla doesn’t hold back from hitting rival Maliksi, who was once his governor.Sen Manny Villar’s Nacionalista Party is also supporting the Lakas-Magdalo coalition, despite an NP-LP alliance at the senatorial race.Senatorial hopeful Cynthia Villar insists NP’s backing of Lakas-Magdalo will not affect the NP-LP partnership. CYNTHIA VILLAR, FORMER LAS PINAS REP.: President Noy and Senator Villar talked about the coalition. Ganito na yung Cavite, wala naming misrepresentation soon. They talked about it and the President said, ‘We’ll go our own way in Cavite.’ With a history of graft cases, broken promises and cheating accusations between the two clans, the families of Remulla and Maliksi are longtime rivals in the province of Cavite.Cavite’s 1.6 million voters is the second largest voter base in the country outside of NCR.

Miriam Santiago warns guest candidates of the Liberal Party and the United Nationalist Alliance not to follow in her footsteps.Santiago, a guest candidate of 3 parties in the 2010 polls, says shared candidates might end up with no support from either side.She says the problem in every election is convincing every senator to campaign for the whole ticket.She adds, “Usually the reaction of the other candidates in both tickets is envy and suspicion.”Santiago is referring to possible common candidates in the 2013 senatorial elections: Senators Loren Legarda and Francis Escudero, and Movie and Television Review and Classification Board Chairperson Grace Poe-Llamanzares. Story 6: THE SENATE RE-ELECTIONISTSThe election season begins next week, with the filing of certificates of candidacy for the 2013 midterm polls.Leading the senatorial race are 6 re-electionists with name recall and media visibility in their favor.Ayee Macaraig reports. They are the survey frontrunners, election veterans and old-timers.If they’ve done it before, can they easily do it again?Six senators are running for reelection in 2013, half of the 12 slots up for grabs.They are Senators Alan Peter Cayetano, Francis Escudero, Gregorio Honasan II, Loren Legarda, Aquilino Pimentel III, and Antonio Trillanes IV.The group is a mixed bag, with different advocacies and experiences.Legarda and Escudero are the most popular, likely to end up as guest candidates of both the Liberal Party and the United Nationalist Alliance.Legarda is a two-term senator who authored environmental laws, while Escudero filed bills on justice and the courts in his first term.They say it does not matter who among them clinches the top spot.   FRANCIS ESCUDERO, REELECTIONIST SENATOR: Kung inuugnay mo iyan sa 2016, wala pa maliban kay Pangulong Arroyo, na duda pa ako kung totoo iyon, ang nanalo sa pagka-presidente na nag-number 1 sa kung ano mang senatorial slate o eleksyon.LOREN LEGARDA, REELECTIONIST SENATOR: It’s never a walk in the park. I’m going to campaign like I’m going to campaign. I’m going to campaign like I’m 38 years old. If Legarda and Escudero topped the 2007 polls, Cayetano and Pimentel had a hard time.The two claim they were victims of cheating and have since pushed for electoral reforms.The Minority Leader led corruption probes as former head of the Blue Ribbon Committee.Pimentel is the newest senator, getting a term of just 1 year and 10 months after winning his election protest in 2011.Honasan and Trillanes have even more colorful histories as former military officials, coup plotters and detainees.Honasan is the most senior reelectionist, authoring laws on the environment, land reform and national security.Yet it’s the youngest senator who is most controversial for taking on Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile over the division of Camarines Sur.Enrile vows to campaign against Trillanes but the neophyte senator remains unfazed.Despite their differences, the re-electionists agree: unclear party distinctions will make 2013 unique.The senators will file their certificates of candidacy from October 1 to 5. AYEE MACARAIG, REPORTING: Traditionally, reelectionists are seen as a shoo-in, thanks to name recall and the so-called equity of the incumbent. But even they call on voters to be more discerning, taking a look at what they’ve done with the taxpayers’ money and the people’s trust.Ayee Macaraig, Rappler Story 7: POLL WATCHDOG: ‘AQUINO ALLIES MAKING MOCKERY OF PARTYLIST SYSTEM’Poll watchdog Kontra Daya wants President Benigno Aquino to tell his allies to withdraw their bids for the party-list elections next year.The group says 3 party-list nominees are not qualified to represent any marginalized group.These are Abante Retirees nominee former Cavite Rep Plaridel Abaya, Alliance of Mindanao Elders nominee Jorge Banal, and Black and White Movement nominee Leah Navarro. Kontra Daya convenor Fr Joe Dizon says the President should ask his allies to “stop making a mockery of the partylist system.” Story 8: VITUG: CBCP NEEDS TO FIX ITS HOUSERappler’s editor at large Marites Vitug says the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines needs to fix its house, after reports of a Filipino priest allegedly involved in a child abuse case and illegal ivory trade.Here’s her video blog. More than 20 years ago, a Filipino priest, Cristobal Garcia, fled the US after he was accused of sexually molesting 2 altar boys.In an interview with Dallas Morning News in 2005, he admitted having sex with these boys who were then in their teens. But he claimed that one of them “seduced and raped” him.The Dominican religious order expelled Garcia. He returned to his hometown in Cebu.Guess what. He was welcomed by Cardinal Julio Rosales, now deceased, who took in Garcia as a priest in the archdiocese of Cebu.Later, Cebu Archbishop Ricardo Cardinal Vidal, successor of Rosales, promoted Garcia to monsignor. Not only that. He was allowed to work with young men in a monastic religious group. The Dallas Morning News reported that Garcia also supervised a squad of altar boys.Another surprising development is that the Vatican suspended Garcia only in June this year—or 27 years after the crime was committed. This shows the tolerance of the Vatican toward sex offender-priests and the extremely slow pace of its sanctions.What is clear in this chain of events is that high Church officials in the Philippines coddled an erring priest.The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines needs to put its house in order and show zero-tolerance for sexual misconduct.

At number 8, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urges the world to draw “a clear red line” to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly Thursday, he says, “It’s not a question of whether Iran will get the bomb. The question is at what stage can we stop Iran from getting the bomb?” He adds, “Red lines don’t lead to war, red lines prevent war…Nothing could imperil the world more than a nuclear-armed Iran.”The issue has strained relations between Netanyahu and US President Barack Obama.Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but Western leaders suspect it is aimed at building a nuclear weapon. And at number 9, NASA’s Curiosity rover is giving scientists more evidence that Mars once had flowing water or a network of ancient streams. BBC reports after just 7 weeks on the Red Planet, the NASA robot beamed photos of classic conglomerates or rocks made of gravel and sand.According to a NASA scientist, the pebbles seen in the photos were likely laid down “several billion years ago” but the actual water streams could have been on Mars “thousands to millions of years” ago.

People are fighting tooth and nail for top talent, whether it is a domestic company or a multinational company,” said Managing Director of Towers Watson Philippines James G. Matti at a stakeholders meeting on September 5. The study, which was the result of interviews with 104 Asian companies between November 2011 and January 2012, found that most multinational companies are after the same executive pool. Roughly 7 out of 10 respondents, or a whopping 77% hire what the study calls ‘internationally mobile employees’ (IMEs) for senior management positions. ‘Serial expats’ is the term Scott Burnett, Towers Watson’s Managing Director for South East Asia, jokingly use to describe the group. “There are serial expats who make a career out of moving around the globe, they spend most of their career on the move, companies are having a lot of challenge thinking about how to retain those individuals,” he said, admitting he is one of them after years of living in Scotland, the United States, Singapore and the Philippines. The report explained that “employers will face stiff competition” for mobile employees in “key positions.” “Asian companies will be competing against European and American companies,” said Matti. Roughly 6 out of every 10 companies polled said they see China and Emerging Markets in Asia as important areas for future growth. Emerging markets in Asia were singled out by 59% of the respondent companies in the study. China was identified as an area for expansion by 62% of companies. North America was the choice of 37% of respondents and was the third most popular destination for growth. That likely means more companies in Asia vying for the same small qualified labor pool, the study noted. “I think unfortunately right now there is no race taking place in Europe. We’re trying to get our story together in the U.S. So there is definitely a race towards Asia. That’s where the momentum is,” said Burnett. Who are the hot internationally mobile employees?Internationally mobile employees (IMEs) are not only highly skilled in their field but have the key personality traits that make them a valuable total package.“What they have is the ability to operate in multiple cultures. They have a high tolerance for ambiguity and they have a very flexible approach to getting things done. They understand leadership through influence, they understand leadership through negotiation and leadership through collaboration,” said Burnett.Many local or foreign hires expect to move and travel. “Most of them are spending 2 to 3 years [in a country, which] gives them an ability to understand the operations but not go native,” he joked. Local hires made up more than half or 56% of senior managers and 69% of critically skilled employees, the study found. Although the senior managers were mostly local, the majority saw themselves traveling. “Normally what I’ve seen with the Korean, Chinese and Japanese [companies is that] they will hire their own. Most of the senior managers come [from the country of origin] and are people they’ve really invested in,” Matti said. Companies feel they can rely on these locally groomed employees to train new employees and instill company values, he explained. Top-performing Asian talent still more cost effective  While some firms prefer to hire from home, Matti said he has seen a spike in mobile employees from Asia over the years.“You will see more Asians now because of the cost ratio because it’s quite expensive to bring an American to the Philippines,” said Matti citing the expensive relocation packages some expatriates expect will include memberships to clubs or their kids’ tuition at an international school. In the past 5 to 8 years, Matti said he has seen “a huge surge of Indian executives,” especially in Manila. “Perhaps the ‘Asian Century’ is really happening. Talent is no longer from the West; it is really from Asia,” he added. “It’s a cost issue at the end of the day,” he said. “If you get somebody from, lets say, India or the Philippines who likewise has an MBA from Wharton or Harvard, they might be ideal because the cost is less.”Still, Asian talent that has been groomed in the region will be up for grabs in the global battle for elite high level employees. That means companies have to take steps to ensure they can attract and temporarily retain workers. What companies can do to deal with competitionThe main message Towers Watson executives wanted to get across to multinational companies: have a plan.Part of a global strategy for competition could simply be redefining the roles of current employees, Burnett said. “There’s a solution to all your problems sitting in your organization and it’s called the middle manager. What we’ve really done is overload individuals in that role. They have the capability to extol the virtues of the culture and what it’s like to be there. [They can also be] somebody to listen and a source of inspiration. That all happens in that middle manager rank,” said Burnett. He stressed that middle managers can be crucial for successful cultural communication — a serious issue many Asian companies encounter when they expand. Asian companies in the survey reported that the 2nd most prevalent problem they encountered with expansion related to “cultural understanding and assimilation.”However, the biggest problem most Asian companies cited was understanding and adapting to “financial, regulatory and political aspects of expansion.” Burnett said knowing and managing employee benefit liabilities is a must. He explained that retirement and health provisions can prove costly in the long run and affect a company’s bottom line. Meanwhile, comprehensive benefit packages can be an attractive incentive for employees. “85% of European and U.S. multinationals have global benefits packages in place, which will be an advantage in competing for global talent,” he said. “South East Asian countries should be particularly mindful of benefits going forward,” he stressed. “As you see moves towards more socialist governments in Europe there is going to be challenging legislation coming out that we need to keep abreast of.”Burnett maintained that “South East Asia is one of the most attractive places to be.” However, the popularity of the region is a double-edged sword. It’s strong growth during the global slowdown is drawing in more companies but also more competition for a small pool of top employees. The solution according to Burnett is for companies to find more ways to differentiate themselves and cater to top managers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/12293-pre-columbian-treasure-trove-to-go-under-hammer/","title":"Pre-Columbian treasure up for grabs","date":"Sep 13, 2012 1:00 AM PHT","snippet":"The collection will go under the hammer in 2013","body":" PARIS, France – One of the world’s rarest collections of pre-Columbian art, estimated at some 20-M euros, will go under the hammer next year in Paris, the Sotheby’s auction house said on Monday, September 10.

From sculptures of wood or stone to ceramics, fabrics and ritual objects, the objects together offer a cross-section of Latin America’s major pre-hispanic cultures. Treasures up for grabs include an Aztec water goddess statue acquired by Josef Mueller in 1920 — the collector’s first major pre-hispanic piece — or a human-shaped vase from the Brazilian island of Marajo, recently loaned to the British Museum.

With his bleak morality tale “Pieta” now one of the favorites to win the Golden Lion prize in Venice on Saturday, September 8, Kim said he regretted that audiences at home still did not sufficiently appreciate his foreign award-winning work. “The Korean film industry is still lacking compared to the European and American markets,” Kim said in an interview at the Excelsior Hotel, striking an arresting sight in his camouflage jacket, baggy trousers and red-laced boots. “They still view films as entertainment instead of looking at artistic value or social issues,” said Kim who — despite having made 18 movies — is still seen as something of an outsider in Korean cinema and has no formal schooling in film. Kitano, who premiered his Yakuza flick “Outrage Beyond” at the festival this week, went even further saying art house cinema in Japan was in “dire” straits. “You have to make a film like ‘Avengers’ to get recognition,” he told a select group of reporters on the sidelines of the world’s oldest film festival. “My ‘Outrage Beyond’ is as close as you can get to an ‘Avengers’ kind of movie so I am hoping to get a big audience with this one, as big as possible!” The veteran 65-year-old director — a former stand-up comic and one of the biggest names in Japanese cinema over the past two decades — said apparently only half-jokingly that he was under pressure to make a big box office hit. “My producers are in a difficult position these days because my films have performed so badly in recent years so we had to make a hit! My worst fear is being asked to make a 3rd sequel. That would be my worst nightmare.” Kitano said his previous art house films are now pursuing him like “a ghost.” “I have the feeling that the old Kitano that I killed became a ghost and is haunting me. Maybe this old Kitano will become a zombie and rise again!” He added that some of the difficulties in making art house cinema in Japan were linked to a wider crisis in the cinema industry worldwide. “Fewer people are going to the cinema these days. They would rather watch movies on their smartphones or on a computer,” he said. “Maybe you don’t need a filmmaker to make films any more, maybe you just need a computer programmer!” Kim said that part of the issue is that the market is skewed in favor of blockbusters and suggested that distributing art house via the Internet could be a solution; but he added that the main problem is viewer attitudes. “Audiences need to see that there is much more value to these films than just entertainment,” the 51-year-old director said. “I believe audiences who see this film will question capitalist society.” “Pieta” is a searing condemnation of money-grabbing capitalism couched in a morality tale about a thuggish loan shark who struggles for spiritual redemption when a woman claiming to be his mother suddenly appears in his life. The film is set in the dark alleys and clapped-out workshops of a part of Seoul where Kim himself used to work; its title inspired by Michelangelo’s statue of the Virgin Mary holding the corpse of Jesus Christ. Kim once trained to be a preacher — one of many incarnations in a past in which he was also a street artist in Paris and an officer in the army. “I studied to be a preacher but did not finish. I am trying to realize this by being a filmmaker,” he said, adding that he is working on two new films. “One is also about money and how people eat each other up because of money. Another is about celebrities and how they are viewed,” he said. Critics have noted that this year in “Pieta” and “Outrage Beyond,” both filmmakers have toned down the explicit violence that featured in some of their earlier work and shocked many domestic and foreign viewers. Kim said he realized that audiences “can feel it with their imagination” and wanted the focus to be more on “the implications of the violence.” Kitano said that after his previous film “Outrage,” all anyone talked about were the violent scenes and “they didn’t really pay much attention to the plot.” – Dario Thuburn, Agence France-Presse"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/11031-newspapers-warned-over-prince-harry-nude-photos/","title":"Newspapers warned over Prince Harry nude photos","date":"Aug 23, 2012 10:09 AM PHT","snippet":"The British royal family on Wednesday, August 22, warned the country's newspapers not to publish nude photographs of Prince Harry cavorting with friends on holiday in Las Vegas","body":" LONDON, United Kingdom – The British royal family on Wednesday, August 22, warned the country’s newspapers not to publish nude photographs of Prince Harry cavorting with friends on holiday in Las Vegas. The photographs, published in the United States by celebrity news website TMZ.com, showed the third-in-line to the throne naked in a hotel suite. In one of the two photographs, the 27-year-old is pictured, apparently wearing only a watch and a necklace, covering his genitals with his hands while another person, who also appears to be nude, stands close behind him. In the other, he is bent over bear-hugging a second person, who also appears to be naked. It is not clear if the person is a man or a woman. Clarence House confirmed to AFP on Wednesday that the images were genuine. “At this time we don’t have a comment,” a spokesman told AFP, adding: “We may do later.” It is rare for Clarence House to confirm the validity of such images, which raise questions about security surrounding the British royal. A royal spokesman later confirmed the family had contacted the Press Complaints Commission to request that British newspapers did not print the images, arguing it would be a breach of privacy. The two images were taken at a private suite in the Wynn Resort after a game of strip billiards last weekend, according to TMZ. Newspapers on Thursday adhered to the palace’s request, although The Sun’s front-page carried a mock-up of the infamous photograph with a journalist taking Harry’s role next to the headline “Harry grabs the crown jewels”. The Mirror had “Harry naked romp” splashed across its front page while the Daily Mail ran with “Palace fury at Harry naked photos” as its main headline. A royal source told the UK’s Press Association news agency that Harry had been “letting off steam before the next phase of his military career”. Video has also been released from the same trip that purports to show the prince racing US Olympic swimming gold medallist Ryan Lochte in the pool of a nightclub in the hotel. Lochte, who was in Las Vegas belatedly celebrating his 28th birthday, told Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper that he was “surprised” Harry had challenged him to the race, which the swimming star won. “He’s a great guy, and it was a huge honor to meet him,” Lochte was quoted as saying, adding: “I definitely wasn’t going to take it easy on him!” It is not the first time Harry has taken on one of the world’s top sportsmen — during a Caribbean tour in March, he managed to beat the world’s fastest man Usain Bolt in a joke race. Harry was in Las Vegas after hosting a charity event in San Diego. Known for his playboy reputation, the prince has tried to distance himself from that lifestyle. He caused outrage in 2005 when photographs of him attending a fancy-dress party wearing a swastika armband appeared in the press, and was forced to apologize in 2009 when video footage emerged of him calling an Asian colleague “our little Paki friend”. The prince has also been pictured scuffling with a photographer and admitted to drinking under-age and smoking cannabis aged 17, but has recently presented a more grown-up image and stood in for the queen at the Olympics closing ceremony. A trained army helicopter pilot, he has expressed a strong interest in returning to serve in Afghanistan. His first stint there had to be cut short in 2008 when a media blackout was breached. It is not the first time British royalty has been embarrassed by leaked photographs with a topless picture of the Countess of Wessex, taken before she married Prince Edward, hitting the papers in 1999. Sarah, Duchess of York, was also pictured having her feet kissed by US businessman John Bryan shortly after separating from her husband the Duke of York. – Agence France-Presse"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/9664-frank-sinatra-s-ny-pad-up-for-grabs/","title":"Frank Sinatra’s NY pad up for grabs","date":"Aug 2, 2012 6:33 AM PHT","snippet":"Ol' Blue Eyes' former abode is a surefire party place","body":" NEW YORK, United States of America – Frank Sinatra’s former Manhattan penthouse — where Ol’ Blue Eyes entertained the hell-raising Rat Pack — has gone on the market for US$7.7-M. “Occupy Sinatra’s Party Penthouse Night and Day,” the brokers, Rubicon Property, tweeted.

The Wall, created by Aires Security, has long been a mainstay of the infamous Def Con gathering of hackers that ended Sunday in Las Vegas. Designed as a “security awareness tool” and refined over the years, the Wall captures data sent wirelessly by smartphones, laptops or other gadgets and then finds information unguarded by encryption or tough passwords. Wall builders have long branded folks careless about what they send wirelessly as “sheeple” vulnerable to wolves who can eavesdrop on transmissions as easily as one can overhear a chat in a coffee shop. Those behind the Wall see what Google did by sucking up unprotected wireless data with Street View vehicles as perhaps unethical but perfectly legal. “If you overhear a conversation in a public place, a Starbucks for example, you are not doing anything illegal,” Aires chief Brian Markus said as private data of “sheeple” was projected on a wall behind him. “For wireless, if you are monitoring it passively and you don’t have to break into anything that should be legal.” The Wall team’s T-shirts this year were emblazoned with “Encrypt or you will regret it in the end.” The subject of whether the Wall, and by extension what Google did with Street View, was criminal was the focus of a Def Con session where hackers backed the idea that unprotected data was fair game. “Tech people think sniffing is fine; people who understand privacy think it’s terrible,” University of Pennsylvania distributed labs director Matt Blaze said during the session, referring to capturing wireless data. “If you understand both, your head explodes.” Attorney Kevin Bankston of the Center for Democracy and Technology played devil’s advocate in the discussion, itemizing points of US law that work against Google’s in the Street View controversy. “Whatever you think of this issue it is dead clear that the law is a mess,” Bankston said. Bankston said a key point was that while overhearing conversations isn’t crimes, capturing wireless communications is unless the communication “is readily available to the general public.” Markus considered wireless transmissions to be just that, since gear to “sniff” the airwaves is easily available. “With the Wall of Sheep, we are kind of implying that people who can’t figure out how to set up their routers deserve about the same level of protection as sheep,” Blaze said. “Don’t punish people for not being able to figure out how to turn on the crypto.” Markus was quick to agree that the technically un-savvy don’t deserve to have their privacy trampled. “We are concerned about the everyday user, which is why we are trying to get the message out there,” he said of the purpose behind the Wall. “Legislation is not going to stop the problem,” he continued. “The answer is to push companies to fix it.” WiFi gear that doesn’t encrypt data by default is a dying breed, according to Blaze. Bankston was worried that US justice officials would take advantage of the mood in Washington to expand how much wireless data they could grab from people. “How about a little sniffer on every cop’s belt, or in every cruiser?” he asked rhetorically. “The Department of Justice hasn’t said how they read the law right now, which is notable and worrisome.” The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in April dropped its Street View investigation, saying it could not accuse Google of breaking US law but fining the company $25,000 for what it saw as slow cooperation. The FCC began the investigation in late 2010 after Google announced that Street View cars taking photographs of cities in more than 30 countries had inadvertently gathered data sent over unsecured Wi-Fi systems. Information sucked up by passing Street View cars included passwords, emails, and other data that was being transmitted wirelessly over unprotected routers, according to the FCC. Google has since stopped the collection of Wi-Fi data, used to provide location-based services such as driving directions in Google Maps and other products, by Street View cars. Street View, which was launched in 2006, lets users view panoramic street scenes on Google Maps and take a virtual “walk” through cities such as New York, Paris or Hong Kong. – Glenn Chapman, Agence France-Presse"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/9086-airasia-philippines-rolls-out-piso-fare-promo/","title":"AirAsia Philippines rolls out Piso Fare promo","date":"Jul 23, 2012 10:33 PM PHT","snippet":"More affordable fares at only one peso base fare for local and international destinations including Fly-Thru service from Clark airport to Australia only at airasia.com starting July 23","body":"This is a press release.

Following a fireworks-filled opening ceremony, the game had a slow start, with only Joshua Alolino Layup—good for a 2-0 lead for host team NU—to show for after 3 and a half minutes of action. Despite the attacking play of UE’s Shei Roi Sumang and Pedrito Galanza, the Red Warriors had little going for them with NU’s Henri Betayene manning the paint. The Cameroonian big man altered attempts and forced slashers to adjust in mid-air, in one instance, swatting two shots in less than 10 seconds. Forgoing set play, the Red Warriors opted to attack on the run. With pesky defense, Sumang led the UE run, which culminated in a buzzer-beating triple to end the quarter and put the Warriors up, 15-13. Things went downhill for the red side, however, as the Bulldogs held them to only 8 points in the second canto. With a flurry of 6 three-pointers—4 of them coming in the first 4 minutes—NU led 48-23 at halftime. The third quarter featured a spirited Red Warrior run. Early on, the Bulldogs dictated the pace of play with their superior athleticism. A pair of fastbreak dunks from Bobby Ray Parks and Emmanuel Mbe not only put NU up 56-25 but also drew out the first “oohs” and “aahs” of the season. For a stretch of three minutes, UE’s Anthony Olayon scored put-backs, fastbreak layups and long-range bombs. The Parks-led Bulldogs had no problem matching their intensity. After 30 minutes of play, NU enjoyed a 72-40 advantage. With NU assured of a win, the final period of play was more of a formality than a basketball contest. NU coach Eric Altamirano cleared out the bench to finish the game to the jubilant and raucous approval of the home crowd. Jeoffrey Javillonar led the Bulldogs with 19 points while defending league MVP Parks had 16. UE floor general Sumang paced the Red Warriors with 21 markers. Better rapport In an interview after the game, Parks said he was proud of the team’s performance. “Stay together, stay humble and stay focused,” he said, echoing Bulldogs head coach Eric Altamirano’s words.  Parks also told Rappler that the team’s rapport is to thank for their 35-point win over UE. “Creating that relationship and that bond with them… it just shows on court,” he said. Parks also downplayed predictions that the Bulldogs would be one of the teams to beat this season.  “We’re not really the the team to beat although everybody says that, Ateneo is definitely the team to beat–that’s a challenge for me,” he said.  NU will meet the Ateneo Blue Eagles next, on July 22, 2012 at 4pm in the MOA Arena.    NU, 90: Javillonar – 19, Parks – 16, Alolino – 12, Rosario – 10, De Guzman – 8, Villamor – 6, Mbe – 4, Labing-isa – 3, Ignacio – 3, Betayene – 3, Perez – 3, Neypes – 2, Celda – 2, Rono – 0, Khobuntin – 0 UE, 55: Sumang – 21, Razon – 8, Galanza – 8, Olayon – 7, Santos – 4, Belleze – 2, Javier – 2, Flores – 2, Sumido – 1, Alberto – 0, Villarias – 0, Valdez – 0, Duran – 0, Duncil – 0    Quarter scores: 13-15, 48-23, 72-40, 90-55 – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/6552-vilma-mrs-villar-enter-senate-magic-13-pulse-asia/","title":"Vilma, Mrs Villar enter Senate magic 13 – Pulse Asia","date":"Jun 6, 2012 5:10 PM PHT","snippet":"Vilma Santos and Las Piñas Rep Cynthia Villar enter Pulse Asia's so-called Magic 13 for the 2013 senatorial race","body":" MANILA, Philippines – New list, new faces. Former Las Piñas Rep Cynthia Villar and actress-turned-Batangas Gov Vilma Santos-Recto are among new names who made it to a survey’s so-called magic 13 for the 2013 senatorial polls. In a May 20 to 26 Ulat ng Bayan survey, Pulse Asia added the names of Villar and Santos-Recto in its questionnaire for the 2013 elections.  Villar ranked 11-21 with a voter preference of 25.1 while Santos-Recto ranked 13-21 with a voter preference of 23. Mrs Villar has declared her senatorial bid while Santos-Recto has not announced her plans for 2013. Villar is the wife of Sen Manuel “Manny” Villar Jr, who ends his Senate term next year. The Villars belong to the Nacionalista Party (NP).  Santos-Recto is married to Sen Ralph Recto. She is entitled to seek another 3-year term in 2013. The Rectos are members of President Aquino’s Liberal Party (LP).  Pulse Asia ran a new list of potential senatorial candidates after dropping some of the names it used in its February 26 to March 9 survey. Those Pulse Asia dropped include former Vice President Noli de Castro, his fellow broadcaster Ted Failon, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, and TV host Kris Aquino. In an interview with Rappler, Pulse Asia President Ronald Holmes explained that the pollster decided to drop the names of those who have not expressed interest in the polls. Holmes also said that because the May list is new, it is not comparable to the previous one. Pulse Asia asked respondents, “If the 2013 elections were held today, who in this list would you vote for senator? Choose only 12 names.” Twelve senatorial seats are usually up for grabs in mid-term races, but another seat is vacant – the one previously occupied by President Benigno Aquino III, a senator until 2010. Congress, however, will have the ultimate say on whether there would be 12 or 13 contested seats in 2013. Chiz bounces back Sen Francis Escudero regained his lead over Sen Loren Legarda. Escudero had dropped to number two in the March survey. In May, he bounced back with the highest voter preference at 65.1 compared to Legarda’s 63.6. Yet they both had a rank of 1-2. Rounding up the top 5 are Senators Alan Peter Cayetano, Cagayan Rep Juan Ponce “Jackie” Enrile, and Transportation Secretary Mar Roxas.  Here is the rest of Pulse Asia’s survey:   Holmes said that because a news website preempted Pulse Asia’s announcement, the pollster will no longer issue a media release explaining its latest findings. – Rappler.com Click on the links below for related stories. "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/5544-rappler-newscast-may-17-2012/","title":"Rappler Newscast | May 17, 2012","date":"May 17, 2012 8:19 PM PHT","snippet":"Senators say Chief Justice Renato Corona will likely attack the credibility of evidence.

The SALN, a document taken for granted by public officials, is at the center of the anti-corruption battle. The trial serves as an awareness campaign on the SALN and what its uses are. Second. Our bank secrecy laws on foreign currency deposits are out of sync with the international community’s campaign against corruption and money laundering.Third.

At number 8, Gaydars exist, at least according to research published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE, which finds that most people have an automatic gaydar that allows them to evaluate sexual orientation in less than a blink of an eye. Participants were 65% accurate when guessing sexual orientation of women, but only 57% correct when it came to men. At number 9, coffee drinkers, rejoice!

Mick Pennisi, known more for ‘flopping’, hit a clutch 3-point basket to stretch Barako’s lead to five with two minutes left in the game. He was awarded best player honors tallying 15 points and 8 rebounds, shooting 50% (4 out of 8) from downtown. Barako Bull led by as much as 21 points following a lay-up by 2-time PBA MVP Willie Miller but saw that lead dissipate as the game neared its closing minutes. The Texters’ comeback attempt took a hit when reigning MVP Jimmy Alapag was thrown out of the game after getting hit with a second technical foul with over four minutes left in the final quarter. Alapag’s first technical was called after he elbowed pesky defender Ronald Tubid.  The imports led the charge for both clubs with Gabe Freeman of the Barako Bull, who scored 27 points and hauled down 14 boards, gaining the edge over counterpart Donnell Harvey who scored 19 points and grabbed 18 rebounds. Barako’s game plan was to keep it a low-scoring ball game and they intend to do it again on Monday as they attempt to ‘slay a giant’, says Barako coach Junel Baculi. Expect an inspired effort from the Tropang Texters who is familiar with a back-against-the-wall situation when they came back from being down 3-1 to take the Philippine Cup semifinals series against the Petron Blaze Boosters.   “When your back is against the wall, there’s only one option…come out swinging,” tweeted Talk ‘N Text forward Harvey Carey.

Suarez says the group will submit a manifesto nominating him as Minority Leader, replacing Albay Rep Edcel Lagman.  In a press briefing on Saturday, January 14, Suarez says he has the support of 19 lawmakers belonging to the 22-member Minority. He adds he is no power-grabber, being the Minority’s rightful leader based on a term-sharing agreement with Lagman. Lagman claims the agreement was only for the House speakership. Suarez, however, says it covered the Minority Leader post because the members knew they were outnumbered in the House and it was impossible to get the speakership.  A showdown is expected between the two on Monday when Congress resumes session.   Suarez also comments on the presence of Lagman at the traditional vin d’honneur hosted by President Benigno Aquino III in Malacañang on Friday, January 13. Reporters asked him about a photo on the Philippine Daily Inquirer showing Aquino and Lagman shaking hands. Lagman attended the event amid reports he would jump ship and join the majority. – Rappler.com   "}]}
