No member of the news and editorial team participated in the publishing of this piece. In the Food & Beverage (F&B) landscape, no restaurant owner is assured a win amid the highly competitive nature of the industry. And with the pandemic initially halting operations, restaurants were forced into an even tougher challenge of surviving the unexpected.  Despite these challenges, however, it soon seemed that not all hope was lost for small and medium food businesses. Despite many competing brands and changes in customer habits, online food deliveries helped provide businesses another avenue to reach customers.   While the online food delivery industry was already rising even before the pandemic, the shift from offline to online accelerated further when Filipinos were forced to stay at home. Since then, online food delivery services have become a way of life.  “Food is a big part of our culture, and online food delivery opened a world of endless possibilities for us food-loving Filipinos. Now, any food craving can be satisfied with just a few taps on your phone. And we at GrabFood are proud to contribute to that satisfaction by providing Filipinos with the widest range of restaurant selection,” said Greg Camacho, GrabFood Philippines’ head. Leading online food delivery service GrabFood consists of thousands of restaurants for Filipinos to choose from, including up-and-coming restaurants Blake’s Wings and Steaks, Thai Mango, and Corndog 28. More than just surviving the challenges of the pandemic, these businesses also brought home sought-after recognitions at the recent Golden Grab Awards 2021, which celebrated Grab’s best-performing merchant-partners. Known for its flavorful wings and steaks, casual dining restaurant Blake’s Wings and Steaks has been a GrabFood merchant-partner even before the pandemic. Starting out as a friendly neighborhood restaurant in Marikina, family-owned business Blake’s Wings and Steaks has since expanded to seven branches – all available for delivery via GrabFood. With the delivery app’s “long-distance delivery” feature, the restaurant was able to even further expand its delivery range up to a 10KM radius, reaching even more customers across the metro. “We got most of our sales from the Grab app – maybe 90% or even 95% come from the Grab app – so that’s really how Grab played a huge role in how we’re still thriving in the business now,” said Blake’s Wings and Steaks owner Joana Manalo. Aside from their presence in GrabFood, Blake’s Wings and Steaks recognizes the importance of a well-curated online menu. Because of its visually appealing and creative menu options, they were given the “Menu Maven” award. Aside from GrabFood’s Long Distance Delivery feature that expands restaurants’ delivery range, merchant-partners can also benefit from GrabFood’s 24/7 operations. Thai Mango Dessert by Chef Kim, which was recognized as the “Newbie No More” at the Golden Grab Awards, is one of the many merchant-partners that acknowledge the positive impact of the 24-hour service. What they once thought would only work for big-name brands, the 24/7 operations helped their business expand to a new set of customers: the night shift workers. With a goal of becoming the pioneer of 24/7 Thai food delivery, Thai Mango Dessert provides healthy options for those working at night or have late-night cravings. From one branch in March last year, this Newbie No More merchant-partner has now expanded to five branches across Metro Manila. A rise in online delivery services has also brought about the need for restaurants to adapt to a more delivery-friendly packaging that not only preserves the quality of their food, but also gives customers a more enjoyable eating experience. Korean corndog food business Corndog 28 bagged the “Pack It Like It’s Hot” award because of their dedication to innovating through their packaging. Beyond being functional, Corndog 28 owner Eugene Leo Uy also stressed the importance of creating an attractive packaging. “It’s one of the main entry points for the customer to really see and understand your product,” he shared. In the age of digital content creation, an aesthetically pleasing or “Instagrammable” dish is bound to make a restaurant more impactful to consumers. It goes without saying the pandemic took the world by surprise – but this did not stop Grab from rising up to the challenge of serving Filipinos. From being just a ride-hailing app to the super-app it is today, Grab now offers a food delivery service with GrabFood, an on-demand groceries and essentials service with GrabMart, a parcel delivery service with GrabExpress, and a safe and rewarding e-wallet with GrabPay. “At the onset of the pandemic, movement was much more limited—even for a delivery service like us. But that challenge is what motivated us to find solutions to how we can provide Filipinos their cravings and essentials. Aside from customers who needed safe and convenient access to their essentials, we also had our delivery, driver, and merchant-partners to think of – and how we can continue to provide them with income opportunities,” said Anton Bautista, Grab Philippines’ head of deliveries. GrabFood, first launched in the Philippines in 2018, is now available in 107 cities. As the company expanded its operations to more locations, even more merchant-partners have joined the platform, some even joining its GrabFood Signatures program which allows them to be available for delivery only on GrabFood and enjoy exclusive benefits and marketing opportunities from Grab.  To encourage customers to continue supporting their favorite food businesses, Bautista assures that both customers and merchant-partners can look forward to more promos and features in the coming year, including an enhanced Self Pickup service for a more convenient ordering experience, as well as new offerings through GrabFood Signatures. “With the country slowly easing back into the ‘old normal’, we anticipate more consumers choosing to eat out. Despite this, we at GrabFood are always thinking of opportunities to provide our merchant-partners the same level of support we’ve given them in the past two years. As we continue adapting, one thing is certain: We will continue to provide our fellow Filipinos with the safety and convenience they have relied on with us,” said Bautista. – Rappler.com Hungry?

Fresh outbreaks in Southeast Asia hit Grab’s mobility unit that fell behind its deliveries business, its largest by billings. Its mobility business brought in $88 million in revenue, down 26% from a year earlier, while sales at its deliveries unit rose 58%. “Mobility and food delivery services were suspended in Vietnam for most of Q3, and six of our core countries in which we operate experienced tighter movement controls,” said chief financial officer Peter Oey. Grab is also seeing rising competition in the space from other “super apps” that provide a host of services under one app like Gojek in Indonesia. Singapore-based Grab, which clinched a $40-billion merger with blank check firm Altimeter Growth Corporation in April, the biggest of its kind, is nearing its US listing. Founded in 2012 as a regional taxi app in Malaysia, the SoftBank Group-backed company operates a “super app,” which provides ride-hailing, food, and grocery delivery, mobile banking, and payments in over 400 cities in eight countries in Southeast Asia. The company’s adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization widened 66% to $212 million. Total revenue fell to $157 million for the quarter ended September 30, from $172 million a year earlier. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/environment/five-planet-friendly-things-cop26-glasgow/","title":"5 planet-friendly things at COP26 in Glasgow","date":"Nov 10, 2021 7:41 AM PHT","snippet":"From reusable coffee cups to low carbon footprint cuisine, environmentally-friendly innovations are test-driven at the UN climate summit","body":"The annual United Nations climate change conferences have typically become showcases of earth-friendly products and innovations. COP26 (26th Conference of Parties) in Glasgow, United Kingdom is no different. Here at the Scottish Events Campus, UN summit participants use recycled coffee cups and sit in recycled IKEA chairs. The whole conference is paperless. To find out the schedule of meetings, side events, and press conferences, you consult the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change app.  That app also stores all documents produced by the climate negotiations, accessible to anyone without wasting paper. It’s a no-brainer for a summit about climate change, the biggest environmental crisis facing the planet, to try to be eco-friendly. But when you think of the 40,000 people registered for the two-week event – which includes government delegations, experts, civil society organizations, and journalists – it’s not only logical, but an absolute necessity to be sustainable. Here are 5 planet-friendly things you’ll find at COP26: You’ll find these light blue plastic cups everywhere at the summit – on work desks at the Media Center, in the hands of a sleep-deprived negotiator, under the tripod of a cameraman waiting for an interview to start. These are the only cups used by the many grab-and-go cafes and food stops scattered around the COP venue. When done with the coffee, participants are supposed to deposit the cups in drop points so that they can be washed and reused again and again throughout the summit. Called CORRETTO cups, these cups are themselves designed with a low carbon footprint in mind. According to the British Plastics Federation, the cups are also more recyclable than typical paper coffee cups because they don’t use the wax or plastic lining most paper cups need to hold hot liquids. Plus, the type of polypropylene material used by the cup protects the hand holding the cup from heat without the usual cardboard sleeve. The menu of food served at COP26 wants you to know the carbon footprint of what you eat. The dishes are labeled “low,” “medium,” and “high” to enable attendees to choose food with the lowest carbon footprint. Levy, the food provider at COP26, also assures participants that it’s using locally-sourced and in-season produce and increased its proportion of plant-based dishes served at the summit. The stylish IKEA chairs free for attendees to use will not go to waste when the summit concludes. Each one comes with a label declaring that IKEA will work with the Glasgow City Council and United Kingdom government to find a new home for the chairs, whether to a charity or local community project. On standby at the COP venue is a prototype hydrogen electric ambulance, an ambulance designed not to produce any planet-warming emissions, This green National Health Service ambulance is part of the NHS’s goal to reach net zero emissions by 2040 for emissions it controls. Colorful trashbins made of cardboard can be found all over the COP26 venue. Of course, they allow attendees to segregate. The bins for the reusable coffee cups are nearby. So is a hand sanitizer station. – Rappler.com This story was produced as part of the 2021 Climate Change Media Partnership, a journalism fellowship organized by Internews’ Earth Journalism Network and the Stanley Center for Peace and Security.

She first shared a five-minute video that showed several Grab food riders arriving at their house, all ordered by Manalo.  The video also includes a phone conversation between one of the riders and Manalo. “Sila po ‘yung umorder. Pakisabi diyan kay Kris Bernal, tingnan niya ‘yung Messenger niya. May umorder lang din sa’kin at dalhin daw sa bahay nila,” Manalo was heard saying in the clip.  (Tell Kris Bernal to check her Messenger. Someone just asked me to order and have it delivered at her house.)  Manalo added, “Ay nako, kuya, hindi ko na kasalanan ‘yan. Kasalanan ‘yan ni Kris Bernal.” (Oh my gosh Kuya, it’s not my fault. It’s Kris Bernal’s fault.)  The rider replied, “Hindi nga raw sila nagpa-order sainyo, ikaw lang ata panay ng order tapos dinadawit mo pa pangalan nila.” (They said that they didn’t order anything from you. It seems like you’re just making these orders and dragging their names.)  Bernal wrote in the caption that the amount of deliveries were no joke. “I’m not the only victim here but also the grab riders na nag-seserbisyo lamang (who are just working) and went all the way here to deliver several orders. I really feel bad for the riders’ efforts. This thing has been prevalent lately,” she said. In a separate post, Bernal said that she can’t think of anyone who would attack her like this. “I have no idea who did this and I can’t remember any incident that triggered this to happen. All I know is I didn’t do anything wrong to someone for me to deserve this kind of treatment.”  She added that she’s more worried about the riders who also suffered from this malicious act. “I really hope that there was even a bit of sympathy to the riders. They are the main victims here. I hope the person who did this will feel a bit of conscience.”  The actress also sought the help of netizens in reporting the scammer to authorities. “I’m sure this is not her real name. But this is the name and number that were recorded with all the deliveries today,” she said.  Bernal also revealed that this isn’t the first time it’s happened to her. She said that the Manalo has also pretended to be her assistant and asked for free products from the small businesses that the actress has promoted.  “Please be informed that I do not support any of these bogus buyers. Please do a cross checking and don’t allow them if they pretend to be my assistant and ask for free goods. I’ll never ask someone to order from me. I’ll order and buy it personally,” she said.  Several celebrities like Sanya Lopez, Shaira Diaz, Kakai Bautista, Tom Rodriguez, and Gian Magdangal commented on Bernal’s post to express their concern and disappointment over the incident.  “This is so dangerous. Sinisira nila ‘yung mga delivery service na sobrang nagpapakahirap sa trabaho (The delivery service riders are just doing their job and they’re the most affected). This should be reported to the police and get those numbers traced back,” Magdangal wrote.  On Sunday, July 4,  Bernal said in an Instagram story that Grab has contacted her about the incident. She also warned her fellow stars to be wary about giving out personal details.  “Apparently, she has done this to a lot of celebrities already. To my co-fellow artists, when you need to provide your address, try your best to provide a different address, name, and contact number,” Bernal said. Bernal is best known for her roles in GMA series’ Dear Uge: ’Till Death Do us Apart, Tadhana, and Impostora.   – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/get-ready-with-me/get-ready-with-bryce-larrosa-family-vlogger-content-creator/","title":"Get ready with Bryce Larrosa, family vlogger and content creator","date":"Jun 4, 2021 12:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Daddy Bryce aims to elevate dad voices","body":"Editor’s Note: The Get Ready with Me (GRWM) series features the morning routines of people from different walks of life, from their first grabs to the way they get ready for work, and to the items they can’t live without. In celebration of Father’s Day, let’s get ready with a father who is championing dad voices on the internet.  Got someone you want GRWM to feature? Just email us at stories@rappler.com with the subject line “GRWM” followed by the name and designation of the person. The family that vlogs together, stays together.  This might as well be the family motto of the Larrosas, more popularly known on the internet as #TheClingyFam. You might have heard of them – they’ve been vlogging since 2017. On their YouTube, they share milestones, marriage and parenting tips, homeschooling experiences, and numerous family activities with the hope of inspiring people to believe that having a happy family is possible regardless of one’s past and present circumstances.  Leading the Larrosas on their daily adventures is Daddy Bryce, a man who wears a lot of hats: he’s a corporate guy turned full-time husband, dad, content creator, sometimes family comedian, and life coach. He’s also been a stay-at-home dad for four years now. Deep in the heart of this loving and funny dad lies an earnest dream of making dad voices more prominent in the parenting space.  Parenthood – especially for vloggers and influencers – is not solely the domain of mothers. Bryce is a testament to the fact that fathers can be and already are authorities when it comes to family matters that many continue to perceive as maternal concerns, such as raising children, planning family bonding activities, and documenting family milestones.  Fatherhood should be celebrated, said Bryce in an email interview. This is why he recently launched his own channel, Daddy Bryce PH. His goal is simple: to provide parents – especially dads – with tips he has gained from his experience as a dad to his three kids.  Aside from these tips, what else can we expect from his own channel? “I’ll also do tutorials on content creation to help those who’d like to start vlogging. You can also expect to see reviews about home gadgets, tools, and appliances. Basically, anything that can be of help to modern-day dads like me or even moms and future parents.”  What does it take to be a dad like Daddy Bryce? Learn more about his everyday routine below.  FIRST GRAB. I usually grab coffee – that is if my wife wakes up first or we both wake up at the same time. She loves making me coffee and I love it even more. Yeeee.  And then I read books. Recently, I started doing my 5-hour rule. It’s a practice where I focus my first hour of each day studying and learning for 5 days. It can be through watching educational videos on YouTube or reading books. SKINCARE ESSENTIALS. I’ve been a stay-at-home dad for four years now so this work-from-home thing setup brought about by the pandemic is no longer new to me. So there are really no changes when it comes to my skincare routine. Actually, there’s really nothing special din naman about it. I just regularly take a bath and if my wife convinces me enough, I let her put a mask on my face. Haha!  BEFORE I START. I don’t really have anything in particular. I just make sure that the tools I need for work – my fully charged laptop, phone, and even my watch – are ready.  IF I MUST GO. I’m a very basic type of person when it comes to my outfit. I usually go out in plain shirts and shorts. Minsan kahit nakapambahay lang like I’ll just be doing groceries. Since naka-mask and face shield naman, I feel like it’s okay to go outside wearing pambahay. Hahaha! IF I’M STAYING IN. When at home, I wear my comfortable sando and boxer shorts. That’s the benefit of not having a kasambahay. You can just wear anything you’re comfortable with. When I have meetings, I manage to wear a comfortable yet decent shirt. FAVE DELIVERS. My family loves ordering food via Grab. On cheat days, we would order donuts. Our fave would be Lola Nena’s Classic Donuts. And when there’s a special occasion, we would get cake from Conti’s.  When it comes to courier naman, our top of mind is Lalamove particularly for transporting important documents or when sending some stuff like gifts to friends.  ROUTINE REMINDERS. It really takes a lot of discipline to stick to a routine. And for a family that has no yaya or extra hand like ours, we can’t help but sometimes fail to do so. What helps us though is our desire to accomplish a lot of things while sticking to our priorities.  As much as we can, we try to sleep early so we can wake up early. Especially on weekdays. We notice we are more productive when we start the day early. We allow room for puyat on weekends. It also helps a lot that my wife is also now working from home. The time she used to allot for travel is now being utilized for family. We get to share chores and [assist in our] kids’ homeschooling. Being present at home 24/7 and having no yaya has also allowed us to train our kids to be more independent. Young as they are, they know how to handle basic chores, carry out tasks, and accomplish their daily goals (i.e. school/learning activities). This helps us a lot in accomplishing day-to-day deliverables as a family. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/goodrap/appreciation-buying-groceries-food-grab-philippines-delivery-riders/","title":"Buying groceries and food for Grab delivery riders","date":"May 21, 2021 2:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Here’s how I show my appreciation for the delivery riders that have helped us all throughout this quarantine","body":"Editor’s note: More than a year into the pandemic, we’ve all developed new routines. This month, GoodRap is putting the spotlight on brands that have made quarantine easier for everyone. In this story, the author shares how she utilizes Grab’s in-app services not just to purchase essentials but also to give back to delivery riders. Like many Filipinos, I still spend most of my days at home. Last year, this was definitely a challenge. Since I used to live on my own in Quezon City, it was difficult to adjust to living in my childhood home in Pampanga again.  Among the many challenges I faced – which you might relate to – is the lack of access to the food I used to enjoy. Here’s an example: when I lived in Quezon City, there was a Bon Chon near my workplace and the condo I lived in. In my Pampanga hometown, the nearest branch is 15 minutes away. If we pair this with the fact that going out of the house for non-essential tasks isn’t encouraged, I used to think that enjoying restaurant food wouldn’t be part of my quarantine experience. Thankfully, delivery apps and logistics services recognized this concern. Most of them have improved their operations – by extending service hours, widening coverage, and adding more partner restaurants – to cater to customers like me. Nowadays, I turn to delivery apps like Grab to satisfy my cravings or to buy essentials.  Of course, I’ve become a dedicated customer. I open the Grab app almost daily. I could probably already name most of the restaurants that are available on the app. Most of all, I’ve become familiar with our modern-day heroes, the delivery riders that regularly come to our home.  Whether it’s a rainy or extremely hot day, at breakfast or dinner time, or for small essentials like tube ice or large orders of Chinese food, these delivery riders make sure that I get what I order promptly. Most of them do it with smiles on their faces and with a kind word when I get my packages.  We’re all probably familiar with a few ways we can be nicer to our delivery riders. Some of the habits I practice as a customer include giving my riders even just a small tip, waiting for them near the gate to ensure quick deliveries, and properly communicating with them to minimize the risk of these riders getting lost on the way.  While these are helpful (and have proven to make these riders happy), I wondered if there was more that I could do to help them out. And it seems like Grab heard my thoughts.  One of the restaurants I always order from is Starbucks. One day, I noticed that the Starbucks store on the Grab app gained a new feature. They have included a “For your rider” tab, which now allows customers to buy food or drinks for their riders.  This is on top of the tipping feature, which enables customers to input a certain amount to give as a tip directly from the app itself. This will be deducted from the customer’s chosen payment method and is helpful for those who prefer contactless delivery since there is no need to physically hand over the tip.  Grab continues to implement programs for the benefit of its riders. Just this month, they rolled out a new feature under the Food for Your Drivers program. Until May 31, 2021, customers in select parts of Metro Manila can go to the Mart section of the Grab app and buy goods from select supermarkets and establishments for their delivery riders.  Partner stores and brands include:  Interested customers can also find the “For your driver” section of these select stores on the app.  Do you also enjoy these services offered by Grab?

The combined entity, which will span online shopping, courier services, ride-hailing, food delivery, and other services in Southeast Asia’s largest economy, will be the biggest privately-held technology company in Southeast Asia. It plans to list in Indonesia and the United States later this year, company executives said. In a joint statement on Monday, May 17, the companies said their combined past valuation was $18 billion based on fundraisings done in 2019 and early 2020. The merger of Gojek and Tokopedia – each backed by global heavyweight investors – comes amid a surge of competition in the ride-hailing and food delivery markets in Southeast Asia. Last month, Southeast Asia’s largest ridehailing and food delivery firm Grab clinched a $40 billion merger with a special purpose acquisition company and Singapore-based regional internet firm Sea Ltd, which runs e-commerce platform Shopee, is also muscling into food delivery and financial services. GoTo’s top investors include Alibaba Group Holding, SoftBank Group Corp, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, Google, and Tencent Holdings. Sources said Gojek’s shareholders will own 58% of the holding company with the balance held by Tokopedia’s investors. “Our business model is now even more diverse, stable and sustainable. We have Gojek’s high volume, high frequency mobility transactions, combined with Tokopedia’s high value, medium frequency e-commerce transactions,” said Tokopedia President Patrick Cao. Cao will become the president of GoTo and Gojek CEO Andre Soelistyo will be chief executive. GoTo’s deal came together quickly in December after months of negotiations between Gojek and Singapore-based Grab fell apart. Using the model of Alphabet, Gojek and Tokopedia plan to remain separate but work together on payments, logistics and food deliveries. While e-commerce is booming in Indonesia, its 17,000 islands are sprinkled across an area bigger than the European Union, making it a loss-making market for e-commerce firms. Goldman Sachs is the financial advisor to Gojek, and Citi is the financial advisor to Tokopedia.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/grab-philippines-lets-customers-buy-groceries-for-riders/","title":"Grab now lets you buy groceries for your riders","date":"May 4, 2021 6:45 PM PHT","snippet":"Customers can give riders free groceries through Grab's 'Groceries For Your Riders' program","body":"Grab customers can now order groceries and other essentials for delivery riders through GrabMart’s latest feature, Groceries for your Riders.

The merger, the biggest blank-check company deal ever, underscores the frenzy on Wall Street as shell firms have raised $99 billion in the United States so far this year after a record $83 billion in 2020. Singapore-based Grab’s agreement with a special purpose acquisition company backed by Altimeter Capital includes a more than $4 billion private investment in public equity by investors including BlackRock, Fidelity International, Janus Henderson Investors, and Temasek Holdings. The offering is led by $750 million from funds managed by Altimeter Capital. The transactions will provide Grab with about $4.5 billion in cash proceeds. Grab said its decision to become a public company was driven by a strong financial performance in 2020, despite the pandemic. Reuters earlier reported that Grab would announce the deal on Tuesday. The deals for Grab, which was valued at just over $16 billion last year, will be a big win for its early backers such as SoftBank Group Corp and China’s Didi Chuxing. The bumper valuation validates Grab’s co-founder Anthony Tan’s strategy to aggressively tap growth in new sectors and ramp up market share by pumping billions of dollars to localize its services and invest in high-growth economies. The proposed transactions, which have been approved by the boards of both Grab and Altimeter Growth, are expected to close over the next few months, subject to shareholder approvals Grab attracted global attention in 2018 when it acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia business after a costly five-year battle and in return took a stake in the company. Reuters reported in January that Grab, which has so far raised about $12 billion, was exploring a US listing. Grab’s agreed transaction will surpass electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors’ $24 billion deal struck with a SPAC in February. With operations in 8 countries and 398 cities, Grab is already Southeast Asia’s most valuable start-up. Leveraging its ride-hailing business started in 2012, the firm has moved into food and grocery deliveries, courier services, digital payments, and is now making a push into insurance and lending in a region of 650 million people. The listing will give Grab extra firepower in its main market, Indonesia, where local rival Gojek is close to sealing a merger with the country’s leading e-commerce business, Tokopedia. Grab, whose net revenue surged 70% last year, has yet to turn profitable, but it expects its biggest segment – the food delivery business – to break even by end-2021, as more consumers shift to online food delivery after the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash-rich, US-listed Sea is also muscling into food delivery and financial services in Indonesia. Both Grab and Sea won digital bank licences in Singapore last year. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/sr-spicy-gumbo-pizza-flavor-february-2021/","title":"S&R introduces spicy gumbo pizza","date":"Feb 6, 2021 3:18 PM PHT","snippet":"S&R's new pizza combines sausage, shrimp, and mild spice!","body":"S&R New York Style Pizza has welcomed a new flavor to their menu – the gumbo pizza, a mildly spicy variant inspired by Louisiana’s seafood and meat stew.

The 5-year senior secured loan was upsized from the initial $750 million after the company secured commitments from international institutional investors, Singapore-based Grab said in a statement on Monday, February 1. Anthony Tan, group chief executive officer and co-founder of Grab, said that investors recognized the value of Grab’s super app platform, as “we continue making consistent progress in achieving our growth and sustainability milestones.” Backed by investors including Softbank Group Corporation, Grab has evolved from a ride-hailing app operator to a one-stop shop for services such as food delivery, payments, and insurance in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people. Ranked as Southeast Asia’s most valuable startup with a valuation of more than $16 billion, Grab recently won a digital bank license in Singapore. Last month, Grab said its total group net revenue jumped by about 70% year-on-year in 2020 and recovered to comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. The loan will be used for general corporate purposes and will allow Grab to diversify its finances. Grab said the interest rate on the loan was lowered by 100 basis points from the original launch guidance to 450 basis points over LIBOR. Grab’s food business, which has benefited from a sector-wide boom in food delivery as countries imposed lockdowns, accounts for more than 50% of its revenue. Grab expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of 2021. JPMorgan was the lead bookrunner on the loan facility, while Barclays, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Mizuho, MUFG, and Standard Chartered were the joint bookrunners. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-considering-united-states-initial-public-offering-2021/","title":"Southeast Asia’s Grab considering US IPO this year, sources say","date":"Jan 18, 2021 8:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab's initial public offering plans have not been finalized and are subject to market conditions, sources tell Reuters","body":"Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery giant Grab is exploring a listing in the United States this year, encouraged by robust investor appetite for initial public offerings (IPOs), 3 sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Grab’s IPO could raise at least $2 billion, one of the sources said, which would likely make it the largest overseas share offering by a Southeast Asian company. “The market is good and the business is doing better than before. This should work well for public markets,” he said. The plans, including the size of the issue and timing, have not been finalized and are subject to market conditions, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the matter. Singapore-based Grab declined comment on the potential IPO. Grab, whose backers include SoftBank Group Corporation and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, has expanded rapidly from its beginnings as a ride-hailing venture in Malaysia in 2012 to become the region’s most valuable startup worth more than $16 billion. The company has raised more than $10 billion as it becomes a one-stop shop for services such as food delivery, payments, and insurance in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people. It recently gained a digital bank license in Singapore. Grab’s total group net revenue jumped by about 70% year on year in 2020 and has recovered to be comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. Moody’s said this month Grab had cash holdings of about $3.2 billion, which the ratings agency “expects will be sufficient to cover negative operating cash flow, capital spending at its transport and food delivery businesses, and scheduled debt maturities over at least the next 2 to 3 years.” One of the sources said he expects Grab’s IPO to raise substantially more than $2 billion as some of its long-term investors trim stakes and new investors come on board. Grab has said its ride-hailing business is breaking even in all its operating markets, including Indonesia, the biggest. It expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of 2021. The IPO plans would come after merger discussions with Indonesian rival Gojek were derailed. Gojek and Indonesian e-commerce leader Tokopedia are in advanced talks for an $18-billion merger ahead of a potential dual listing in Jakarta and the United States, Reuters reported this month. As consumers increasingly adopt online services amid lockdowns to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, investors are paying more focus on market leaders. Grab caught global attention when Uber sold its Southeast Asia business to the company in 2018 after a costly 5-year battle and in return took a stake in Grab. It now operates in 397 cities across 8 Southeast Asian countries and its app has seen 214 million downloads. Grab’s food delivery business overtook the mature transport division to become the company’s biggest segment last year. “It’s quite clear that investors are rewarding growth and market share,” said the second source, pointing to a 15-fold surge in shares of Singapore-based e-commerce, gaming, and payments firm Sea since its 2017 listing in New York. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/analysis-charts-sum-up-how-philippine-economy-endured-year-end-2020/","title":"[ANALYSIS] 7 charts that sum up how the PH economy endured 2020","date":"Dec 29, 2020 12:55 PM PHT","snippet":"'All in all, 2020 was a year of massive economic suffering. It didn’t have to be this way, if only the Duterte government addressed the pandemic sooner and more seriously, and had they spent money smartly, aggressively.'","body":"What a chaotic year 2020 has been. As well as facing its worst health crisis in decades, the Philippines suffered its worst economic crisis since World War II. Although the pandemic left long, deep scars on Filipinos’ economic lives, it’s also an opportunity to transform our economy for the better. Here are 7 graphs that try to capture how our economy endured 2020. I also offer guesses on where we might be headed. Figure 1. What happened: The country’s total output, measured by gross domestic product (GDP), contracted by 10% in the first 9 months of this year, compared with the same period in 2019. That’s P1.41 trillion in lost income. Had our economy grown by 6% — as one might reasonably expect — our losses would’ve ballooned to P2.26 trillion, and the contraction would’ve been worse at 15%. Average income is at a 5-year low, so it’s as if the economic gains in the past 5 years have been erased. Our output also contracted the most in ASEAN: other countries like Vietnam, by stark contrast, averted a recession altogether by promptly containing the virus.  What’s next: Government economists predict a total contraction of 8.5-9.5% this year, and many private analysts expect us to suffer the worst downturn in the region. As quarantine restrictions ease, the economic losses next year might become muted. But until vaccines are distributed widely and equitably, it will take years to return to pre-pandemic levels of prosperity — especially if government fails to ramp up stimulus spending. One international think tank also ranked us as the economy most likely to suffer the pandemic’s long-run effects, partly because of the current structure of our economy, which is too reliant on services. Figure 2. What happened: Not all sectors tanked; our internet economy actually thrived. Data show a whopping 55% growth in e-commerce (think Shopee, Lazada), 48% growth in food deliveries (think Grab Food and Foodpanda), and 27% growth in online media (think Netflix, Spotify, and online gaming). A record number of Filipinos also came to rely on online banking platforms (think GCash and Paymaya). Still, rather unexpectedly, there was a 66% drop in online travel (think bookings for flights and hotels). What’s next: Relaxed quarantine rules will temper the dizzying growth of our internet economy. Still, the behavior changes induced by the pandemic will likely persist. A greater proportion of our workers will want to try (even demand) working from home. Many brick-and-mortar shops and restaurants will not return and choose a wholly online presence instead. Many higher education institutions will want to develop online courses, and telemedicine might become more popular. To support all these changes, internet access and speeds will have to improve drastically. Official output statistics will also need to do a better job capturing our internet economy. Figure 3. What happened: Labor statistics went off the charts. Unemployment rose to a record high in April, at 17.6%. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. As most Filipinos worked fewer hours, underemployment also rose to its highest level since 2016. Millions discouraged by the lack of good job prospects also left the labor force entirely, driving labor force participation to an unsettling record low. Many of them were parents (especially moms) who were forced to stay at home to take care of their families and oversee their kids’ online education.  What’s next: Unemployment has gone down since April, but is still quite high vis-à-vis the long-run trend. Much more worrisome is the plummeting of labor force participation. Until schools fully reopen, millions of Filipinos will continue to shun the labor force, and this will surely drag out our economy’s recovery. Expect more permanent shifts within the labor force, too. Many jobs in services won’t come back (like in tourism) and more Filipinos will seek jobs in internet-related sectors (like e-commerce). Figure 4. What happened: This year saw a record number of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) displaced and forced to return home: about 370,000, with 126,000 more stranded abroad. For the first time in decades, the average growth of OFW remittances — which have kept our economy afloat for the longest time — went into the red. Apart from hurting the purchasing power of their loved ones, this trend also impairs total growth of total consumer spending — hence, economic growth at large. What’s next: While remittances have picked up in recent months, the continual strengthening of the peso — owing largely to the crunch in imports and the general weakness of our economy — diminishes the peso value of these inflows. Seeing that 2021 will continue to be a difficult year for the global economy, many OFWs will fail to return abroad any time soon. In the meantime, they need to adapt and receive sufficient amount of economic aid from government; otherwise, some might be added to the ranks of the poor. Figure 5. What happened: Economic misery rose steeply this year. The hunger rate skyrocketed to its highest level on record: nearly 1 in 3 Filipino households. Nearly half of all families also said they were poor in November, but the figure likely shot up in the months prior. Economic pessimism is also at an all-time high: in May, 83% of Filipinos said the quality of their lives worsened in the past year, and in September the rate was still as high as 82%. Economic pessimists outnumbered optimists for the first time since the Arroyo administration. And consumer confidence fell to its lowest level ever. What’s next: Rampant economic misery calls for massive infusions of economic aid. But the Duterte government failed to provide that. The emergency subsidies in Bayanihan 1 dried up too easily, and aid funding in the 2021 budget was even slashed because of the misplaced austerity of Duterte’s economic managers. One study estimated that as many as 5.5 million individuals could be pushed into poverty if they fail to receive enough economic aid. Consumer confidence is also key to our economy’s recovery. But merely reopening huge swaths of our economy won’t do the trick. Figure 6. What happened: As its revenues shrank and its expenditures swelled this year, government was forced to borrow lots of money from multilateral agencies such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. As of December 15, government has racked up $13.36 million (or about P641 billion) in new external funding. But in fact more funds were borrowed from domestic sources. Because of all this, the debt-to-GDP ratio (a measure of indebtedness) reached 51.2% in September — the highest since 2009.  What’s next: If Duterte soon signs the Create bill — which features corporate tax cuts — expect a further hemorrhaging of tax revenues, which will further put pressure on government to borrow. But more than the rise of indebtedness, much more alarming is the economic managers’ misplaced fiscal austerity, which made them overly reluctant to finance further infusions of economic aid. Borrowing more is okay if it will abate the economic misery caused by the pandemic. Equally disturbing is the slowdown of government spending in spite of the infusion of new loans. Figure 7. What happened: To combat the recession, government resorted to monetary and fiscal policies. But both have proven weak. Despite ever lower interest rates set by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), bank lending has crawled to its slowest pace in more than a decade. The executive and legislative branches must save the day through aggressive fiscal spending. But Bayanihan 1 and 2 were peanuts next to the economy’s GDP losses. And in the 3rd quarter government spending slowed down rather than ramped up. Public construction even shrank, debunking the claim that Build, Build, Build could rescue our economy. What’s next: Until borrowers and creditors become more confident in each other and in the economy, lending will continue to slow down. For its part, Congress passed a 2021 budget that’s just 10% larger than the present budget. Worse, next year’s budget has its priorities wrong: too much of the allocation increases will go into infrastructure, which won’t feasibly revive the economy. Budgets for economic aid, which could help shore up consumer spending, have also been slashed. Absent aggressive fiscal policy, our economy will certainly take longer to recover. All in all, 2020 was a year of massive economic suffering. It didn’t have to be this way, if only the Duterte government addressed the pandemic sooner and more seriously, and had they spent money smartly, aggressively.  A speedy procurement and distribution of vaccines could shore up our economy. But given its track record, the Duterte government will likely botch the vaccines, too.  There’s hope for our economy in 2021. But brace for a difficult road ahead. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan is a PhD candidate and teaching fellow at the UP School of Economics. His views are independent of the views of his affiliations.

You have all of that going on here.” As if on cue, a donkey suddenly appeared with Arnold on my laptop screen. “Lulu likes to chime in sometimes,” he quipped.   “She feels that I get too many close-ups sometimes.” Breaking into a wide grin, Arnold addressed the adorable scene stealer as he gave her a cookie which she promptly chomped: “Lulu, I am doing an interview right now. Can you see that?  You don’t even have lipstick on, Lulu. What is the matter with you today?  Lulu, I’ll give you one more (cookie) and then you have to go.” “There’s Whiskey,” Arnold said about his other impromptu guest, who also got a cookie which she promptly ate. “Whiskey, say hi. Whiskey sometimes lights my cigar.  But I am not going to give her a Cuban cigar because she does not know how to appreciate it.” When his furry pets left, Arnold lit a cigar and smoked it while we chatted. I definitely wouldn’t see this scene or his donkey and mini pony if we were at the Four Seasons instead. “The doctor hates it,” the seven-time Mr. Olympia admitted about puffing a stogie. “I smoke one cigar a day. It’s probably not the best thing for your health.” He clarified, “And those are vegan cookies that I’m eating here. The interesting thing about it is, because they are not really sweet or that sweet. I think that is why Lulu and Whiskey love them so much. “Whenever I start eating a cookie, they somehow smell it and they come running into the house. They start invading my cookie jar and eat cookies.” Surprise, Conan the Barbarian has a sweet tooth.  “Having grown up in Austria, I have a sweet tooth,” he confessed. “That maybe is a weakness because it’s not the healthiest thing to eat.  I love ice cream, apple strudel, cream puffs, cookies, black chocolate with nuts on it that are crunchy and stuff like that.  If someone comes to visit and they bring me sweets, I am in heaven (laughs). I just love sweets.” Note to self: bring ube ice cream and crinkles, leche flan and sans rival if I ever get invited to Arnie’s Brentwood college campus-like estate. The 73-year-old, who also won Mr. Universe twice, recently became a grandpa. Author Katherine Schwarzenegger (Arnold’s eldest child with his ex-wife Maria Shriver) and her husband, Chris Pratt, announced on social media last August 10 that they are proud parents of a baby girl, Lyla Maria. “I’ve gotten hundreds of congratulatory notes, messages, Tweets, and Facetime calls,” he said. Laughing, he added, “It’s the first time I’m getting congratulated over something that I had nothing to do with. But I’m delighted because Katherine has become such a great woman. Her wish was to become a mother and to have a child.” “And now she has that and she’s so happy. The baby is so beautiful. That is not because I’m prejudiced because she’s my grandchild. But she’s just a gorgeous baby. She’s like a little Hummel figurine – the face, it’s so pristine. It’s unbelievable.” He paid tribute to Maria, the Kennedy clan member who is NBC News’ special anchor. “Of course, Maria was an extraordinary mother and still is an extraordinary mother today.  Our kids learned well from their mother. They pick up those cues of how good and selfless she was. “Maria was hands on all the time, even though we always had nannies. Our children are the way they are, great human beings, because of the attention that Maria paid to them.” Since 2013, Arnold has been dating physical therapist Heather Milligan. On the state of the movie industry, which is reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic stalling film production, the actor responsible for a series of blockbusters commented, “It’s a very difficult time, not only in general for the industries and for the economy, but also for the movie industry. They have to figure it (safety protocols) out. It’s very difficult.” “My son-in-law, Chris Pratt, is in the middle of filming his film (Jurassic World: Dominion). He came back for the birth of the baby and then he’s going back to London and continue shooting his film.” “They have all kinds of strict rules with quarantine, testing each day and taking temperatures and all that. It’s very expensive to do all this stuff. So only the big budget movies can afford that. Small movies have to figure out their own way of doing things or shooting where it is safer.” Arnold said he’s not in a hurry to return to a set soon. “I’m not in need of a job,” he declared.  “I have plenty of money and never have to work again. Luckily, I was always very smart in how I invest my money. Unlike other actors who make a lot of money then all of a sudden, they find out that they have no money. They cannot pay the taxes. Not just actors, but also athletes. I’m talking about people who make millions but end up with nothing. So I’m not in that category.” “I have always kept every dollar that I made and invested it so wisely that it made up for the amount of taxes that I paid. So that’s why I’m one of those guys who never worries about big taxes.” “When it comes to filming, I have an underlying health issue, which is my heart. I had two open heart surgeries in the past due to congenital disease, with the heart valves that my mother and grandmother had. So I will always have that. Someone like me has to be extra cautious.” “I will only go and film when I feel that it is safe, the right system is in place for testing and checking temperatures. And everyone is tested. Hopefully in the next few months, there will be a vaccine becoming available so that this problem will slowly go away.” The two-time governor of California is a member of the Republican party but said before the 2016 US presidential elections that he would not vote for Donald Trump. He has criticized Trump on a host of issues. In this interview, Arnold, when asked if he was voting for Joe Biden over Trump, answered, “I’m not (yet) going to make any announcements who I’m going to vote for. But I tell you, there are a lot of things that I do see eye to eye with Donald Trump and there’s a lot of things where I don’t.” In the meantime, Arnold, who is not eligible to run for the US presidency because he isn’t a natural-born American citizen, ticked off what he would tackle if he could become a president. “America is searching for a way to create more equality,” he began. “I would say that equality is a priority since I came to this country. I want to make sure that a black kid in Philadelphia or Baltimore can have the same opportunities that I had when I came to this country. I enjoyed a great education system. I enjoyed that I could get a loan, that I could buy apartment buildings and get into real estate. I got an easy good credit rating.” “All of these things are not equally available to minorities, especially for Blacks. So that would be one of my main issues, not just talk about it but to sit down with Democrats and Republicans and do work on equal housing opportunities, equal criminal justice system and voting rights so that everyone can vote.” “And not have the polling places of Blacks close down so that they make it more difficult for them to vote. But basically, you come up with a new Civil Rights Act, so to speak, just to upgrade what was done in the past. America does not even have an anti-lynching law. That is horrible. So those are the issues that are really pressing today.” “There are all the other issues that America has been falling behind in because our politicians are lazy and locked into their system. Even though they have an 18 percent approval rating, 95 percent of them get reelected because of the way the district lines are drawn. It’s a fixed system. So I would reform that issue to make sure that those politicians do their work.” “We have to build new infrastructure in America, do immigration reform, healthcare reform where everyone is insured and no one has to worry about that. And everyone pays their fair share on that. The list goes on and on. Those things cannot wait any longer.” As he finished his cigar, Arnold reflected on his Hollywood career. Like many film stars, he is jumping into the small screen where the interesting projects are these days. He just signed on to make his TV debut in a spy series for Skydance Television.  “Am I at the top of my acting career?” he asked aloud. “No, because I think that as age goes on, you are going to lose that luster of being the top guy. There are always new guys coming up who are the new big guys on the block.  I enjoyed that when it happened to me but it doesn’t mean that it is over.” “It just means that you are no longer in that category. But I cannot complain at all, because, like I said, whenever I want to work, I work. And when I look back at my history, I was very fortunate to have roles for so many years, decades actually. So my acting career has been really great.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/announcements/wing-zone-chicken-promos-august-2020/","title":"Celebrate Chicken Day every day with Wing Zone’s promos","date":"Aug 25, 2020 10:27 AM PHT","snippet":"Get 20% off on your online orders until August 31","body":"[Editor’s note: You don’t need a reason to throw a feast with Wing Zone’s affordable promos.

But the alphabet shuffle of quarantine acronyms come with imposed curfews and curtailed public transportation – all making it hard to get your hands on condoms, lube, and other supplies that will make your lockdown jiggy safe and pleasurable.  The Red Whistle, an advocacy group focused on filling in gaps in the country’s HIV response through community programs and the use of creative platforms, put together The Condom Heroes – a bunch of brave and fun-loving volunteers ready to answer distress calls for sexy supplies discreetly delivered to you – and best of all, for free.  I followed Condom Hero Jodee Aguillon last month as he went around the Makati-Poblacion area on a bike to make some fresh “love drops.” Gift bags from popular retail stores and inconspicuous brown paper bags contained carefully packed condoms and lubricant.  “Parang Grab food lang,” Aguillon quipped. The Red Whistle has always anchored its advocacy on HIV prevention and sex positivity. During the outbreak of COVID-19 and its ensuing lockdowns, The Red Whistle focused on delivering anti-retroviral (ARV) medication to people living with HIV (PLHIV) in partnership with HIV treatment facilities. ARV is a treatment therapy that suppresses the HIV virus and helps stop the progression of HIV. ARV therapy allows PLHIV to manage HIV and live a normal and healthy life. That effort morphed into a related but similarly necessary service when he UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) partnered with The Red Whistle  to pilot-test a project that would make free condoms accessible through volunteers who serve as condom access points in their barangays. “Many people who ask for condoms are people living with HIV quarantined with their partners. In a period of increased mental health strain and anxiety, safer sex can be a healthy way for partners to release stress and express emotional support for each other. Some individuals who requested it did so in anticipation of the lifting of the lockdown. They just wanted to be ready in case restrictions were eased,” said Benedict Bernabe, president of the Red Whistle. Throughout the quarantine imposition seesaw, the Condom Heroes served hundreds of clients. “Our clients are usually between 18-35 and about 3% are women. We believe this project definitely served its purpose to bring sexual health services closer and more accessible to the community,” said JF Escobañez, Vice President of The Red Whistle.  Direct distribution of condoms is an effective way of ensuring access to sexual health services, especially for vulnerable communities like young people who are prohibited from leaving their homes during quarantine or those living in urban poor areas. Apart from the Condom Heroes, the humanitarian organization Community and Family Services International (CFSI) also distributed free condoms to urban poor communities in Pasay through their outreach workers.  In this era of COVID-19-imposed social isolation, our sex lives are bound to take a hit. Local statistics are not readily available, but according to a survey by the Kinsey Institute, 44% of couples said their sex life declined while another 23% said their relationship is in a better place.  Whether you’re locked down with someone or alone, condoms and lubricant go a long way in making sex safe and pleasurable. Sex therapists and public health experts all say that to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the first line of defense is to have sex only with a partner you live with or with yourself. If you’re flying solo, condoms can help ensure the safe and hygienic use of sex toys. Use a condom and a squeeze of lube when using your sex toy and throw away the condom after. You still have to wash your sex toy afterwards, of course.  Barriers to accessing condoms in the Philippines Public health statistics show that condom usage in the Philippines remains low. Current condom use is about 35% while the UNAIDS goal is to increase usage to 85% to 90%. Condom access is lowest among MSM (men who have sex with men) aged 15-17. Common reasons for not using condoms is unplanned sex and not having a condom on hand, the perception that condoms reduce sensation and the influence of the partner.   Young people also report feeling embarrassed to buy condoms directly from pharmacies.  The Red Whistle condom packet comes with lubricant which significantly amps up the pleasure factor of condoms. When used correctly and consistently, condoms have been scientifically proven to be effective in preventing unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like HIV. The Condom Heroes have already finished their pilot run but they’re not hanging up their capes, bikes, or masks just yet. As they said on their social media page, they “might be in your neighborhood soon!” – Rappler.com Ana P. Santos writes about sexual health rights, sexuality, and gender for Rappler.

Sobrang konti ng food, sariling bayad, and bawal umorder outside, bawal Grab food, and we can only order in the hotel. Ang mahal pa ng pagkain – P60 ang extra rice,” shared Bagunas, who had to shoulder all expenses incurred during the quarantine period. (There’s food from breakfast to dinner, but it’s not enough. It’s only a small serving, I had to pay for it on my own, we’re not allowed to order food from outside, no Grab food, and we can only order in the hotel. It’s so expensive that it costs P60 for extra rice.) According to the spiker, the system was also inconsistent as there were others who got their results immediately, while others have been staying in the hotel for more than a week.  Bagunas, who played as an import for the Oita Miyoshi Weisse Adler, returned to the Philippines on Friday, May 15 after rebooking his flight 4 times due to canceled flight schedules from Tokyo to Manila.  The 2019 Southeast Asian Games men’s volleyball silver medalist was initially set to return on May 3, but the Philippine government suspended all flights that day. His airline also canceled flights as it needed to comply with the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) requirements to continue flights to-and-from the country.  Bagunas, though, tested negative on Thursday, May 21, but has to wait for the certificate to leave the hotel. The volleyball star will be training in the Philippines through online individual workouts before his Japan V-League resumes in August or September.  Unlike the Philippines, he was able to train normally back in Japan as businesses and mass transporation have resumed operations. (EXPLAINER: When can sports resume amid coronavirus pandemic?) “Normal mga tao sa Japan ngayon. Pwede mag-jogging, pwedeng lumabas. ‘Yung iba natatakot lang lumabas tapos ‘yung mga store, limited time lang mag-oopen. Tuloy pa rin ang mga tren, Shinkansen and domestic flights,” said Bagunas.  (People in Japan are going about their normal lives.

As we all know our hard-working farmers barely make ends meet due to layers of middlemen, but with the DA purchasing fresh produce directly from farmers and agripreneurs, they are now able to earn more,” Cu said. “We are hopeful that these local produce can reach far and wide through the technology and wide delivery network of GrabExpress.

The incessant alerts signal another attempt to refresh a Facebook page.  She is glued to the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, her finger flipping through and tapping on posts by the bureau, desperate for any update on the detainees at the Quezon City Jail.  She already has every reason to worry about the safety of her brother Melvin, one of the 3,821 persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) there, amid the coronavirus pandemic that has infected thousands in the Philippines.  The jail is located in a city hardest hit by the coronavirus, with at least 1,016 cases, as of April 17.  At least 380 out of the 467 jails under BJMP are congested, as of October 2019. This results in a national congestion rate of 450%, which means 6 detainees occupy the space only meant for one. On March 18, a day after Luzon was put on lockdown and as calls mounted for the humanitarian release of low-risk and vulnerable prisoners, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año rejected suggestions from advocacy groups and told Rappler prisoners were “safer inside.” A month later on Friday, April 17, one of Mylene’s worst fears became reality. Through a Facebook live video, BJMP authorities announced there were at least 18 people confirmed to have the coronavirus inside the Quezon City Jail – 9 prisoners and 9 personnel. “Takot na takot kami kasi kahit pasaway iyon, kapatid ko iyon eh,” Mylene told Rappler. “Gusto naming malaman na ligtas siya o kung ano ang ginagawa nila para maging ligtas sila.”  (We’re really scared because even if he’s stubborn, he’s still our brother. We really want to know that he’s safe or what authorities are doing to ensure their safety.)  The last time she visited Melvin was in the last week of February and their conversation was often interrupted by his coughing fit. This worried Mylene, but all she was able to tell her brother was to take care of himself.  “Talagang inuubo siya noong araw na iyon,” she recalled. “Siyempre sa siksikang tao, kapag umubo ang isa magkakahawaan na.”  (He was really coughing so hard that day. Of course in a crowded situation, when one coughs, it will really spread.) The desperation comes from an age-old problem in the Philippines where police arrest more alleged criminals than jails can handle and courts could allow for release, leading to staggering overcongestion rates.  With cramped spaces, diseases spread like wildfire. It’s exacerbated by the breakout of the highly infectious coronavirus – faster than the government can make a final decision on how to address the problem. ‘Parang sardinas’ Melvin, a construction worker, has spent almost 7 months in jail after being arrested for illegal drugs in October 2019.  Before visitations were suspended and the eventual Luzon-wide lockdown, Mylene and another sister visited him every 3 weeks. They would take a day off from working at the neighborhood market and catch a bus to the corner of Kamuning Road and EDSA.  Their short visits with Melvin were inundated with concerns. The things the sisters saw and heard were far too worrisome to ignore, Mylene said.  There are too many people inside, he told them in between asking about their family. The crowd is suffocating, the heat unbearable. His health suffered.  “Kapag natutulog daw siya, halos idlip na lang kasi wala talagang space para makatulog na maayos,” Mylene said. “Parang sardinas daw sila talaga kaya awang-awa ako.”  (When he sleeps, it’s practically catnaps because there really is no space to sleep properly. They are like sardines so they are really pitiful.)   *Interviewees requested to use first-name aliases for privacy and protection.

I live three blocks from the Philippine General Hospital (PGH). When one is on Surgical Pathology rotation, it is not unusual to be cutting specimens until late night or until the wee hours of morning just to finish. Walks like these are unavoidable. That night, the street was dead silent, with looming shadows from the street lamps.  At a short distance, three men approached me. “Boss, saan kayo papunta?” (Where are you headed?)  I instinctively grabbed my ID which hung on my neck and blurted, “Doktor po ako sa PGH!” (I am doctor at the PGH)  I stepped into the light to show them my ID, and they let me pass. I knew they were probably just barangay tanod (village watch) officers, but I was kind of shaken by the experience. A month ago, the streets of Pedro Gil would have been teeming with jeepneys roaring past me, with street vendors selling balut and barbecue on the sidewalk.  None of that now. We were on lockdown, and strict curfew was implemented.  Community quarantine  About a month ago, when we first heard of a novel coronavirus ravaging the city of Wuhan in Hubei, China we thought little of it. Just a distant problem of a virus infecting the residents of the city. We watched the news of their lockdown on television, seeing the panic and the desperation. It seemed so distant. But they had underestimated the menace. People fleeing Wuhan brought with them the virus to other parts of Asia, Europe,and America and we watched stunned as the first cases were reported in Manila.  Last March 12, the national government announced a community quarantine over Metro Manila. People panicked, some hoarded groceries and goods, some grabbed their suitcases in a mad rush to the provinces. At the central laboratory, we were told we were going on skeleton duty. The residents were divided into three groups, each to go on one week straight duty, and two weeks quarantine.  I was part of the first team and it was chaotic. Meetings were held with the section heads on Monday, March 16, to discuss the skeleton schedule of all the laboratory personnel. We were severely going to be undermanned, but it was the only way to ensure that all services will be available with the staff having minimal exposure to the hazards at the hospital. The two-week quarantine after exposure was necessary, it was the only way to guarantee that everyone can safely rotate. A chilling scenario if the skeleton duty was not implemented was that an exposure from someone sick can transmit the virus and render the staff ill and severely impact laboratory operations. For our part, only a third of the residents will do the job of grossing, signing out, resolving backlog cases, and attend to referrals.  Skeleton duties   Later in the week, the national government announced an enhanced community quarantine – meaning public transportation will be halted, work suspended, curfews in place. Only groceries, pharmacies, and banks were open. Problems arose in the already thinned out staffing, because of transportation and accommodations. Some medical technologists had to cram into a small space at the back of the laboratory information to sleep. Part of the blood bank was also used by the staff to rest in. Transportation was a problem even to those with private vehicles because checkpoints were strict.  (READ: Left in the dark: Little protection for government’s coronavirus frontliners)  It was a logistical nightmare that required coordination and a lot of paperwork. During most of our daytime duties we struggled to look for housing for the staff, arrange schedules, and get food for those on duty. Food was a challenge because most fast food chains and restaurants were closed. After a short deluge of donated food, it slowly trickled down to none.  On top of this, we still had to continue grossing specimens which were surprisingly voluminous and of quality- with maxillectomies, whipples procedure, total prostatectomies, and even gynecologic malignancy specimens. We were told that despite halting admissions, they had apparently filled the surgical wards with patients prior to the lockdown. Food that our consultants and some donors provided helped tide us over in this seemingly long first week of community quarantine. Delicious food helped keep the spirits up during the week. (READ: How to help healthcare workers, frontliners during coronavirus pandemic) Then to our surprise, we were told Pathology residents will now help man the COVID triage area. That removed two more posts from the residents on duty. Now we had to cover each other during AM and PM duties, grossing and signing out. Hope or uncertainty  Recently we were told that PGH will be a referral center for COVID-19 cases. That posed a huge potential problem in a time where personal protective equipment like masks, gowns, gloves, and face shields are hard to come by. It would be like going to war without an armor. If health workers are exposed without adequate protection, they are going to be vulnerable to the virus, including their families, in turn. Such strange times. I remembered my fourth year of medical school or clerkship and the strongest storm ever recorded in human history leveled Tacloban City and I was in ground zero. Except, this time, as I looked around the street that night, the infrastructure was intact, the electric lights still blazed. Regardless, I felt the same ominous feeling.  People hoarding goods, and even our co-employees at the hospital grabbing donated food, is an ever present reminder of the human instinct to survive during times of disaster. It was similar to the looting incidents in the aftermath of Yolanda. It was not reassuring.  I hope that the government does the right thing and support the frontliners in this health crisis of global proportions. Potentially, the next coming weeks could be rough for our country. (READ: Filipino scientists call on government to conduct mass testing for coronavirus) But there is hope. Every time I see dedicated doctors, nurses, medical technologists, other allied health professionals and even guards, soldiers, couriers, and street sweepers I encounter while walking the streets early morning, I am reminded of the resilience of the human spirit and the undying will and dedication to fight this battle.

At the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) briefing, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, now the official talking head of the IATF, said that anything that falls under land, air, and sea travel will be suspended. “The idea here is to keep people at home. Don’t try to dwell on the exemptions,” Nograles said. The Cabinet Secretary said there will be no jeepneys, buses, taxis, railways, or anything that equates to public transportation. The suspension includes sedan-hailing services and motorcycle taxis. People are discouraged from leaving their homes, except to buy food, medicine, and other necessities. “If there’s no public transportation, [ride a private car], or you have to walk,” Nograles said. Exemptions President Rodrigo Duterte announced Tuesday night that the entire island, home to over 57 million, will be under a total lockdown to reduce the movement of people, as the initial Metro Manila-wide quarantine seemingly didn’t work. (READ: Day 1 of Metro Manila lockdown: Different checkpoints, different rules) Health workers, security forces, and the media are among those exempted from the travel ban. Asked how these people can travel from one place to another, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said that this will be up to local governments to provide transportation, but qualified that this should be “commensurate to those who will use.” “We dont want to operate more public utility vehicles because that will encourage people to move. We want to restrict the movement of people to the maximum,” Año said. Deliveries Under the lockdown guidelines, there will be no restaurants for people to dine in, with services restricted only to “food preparation and delivery.” Asked whether online food delivery services can continue to operate, Nograles said they are inclined to allow delivery services straight from the restaurant itself, then he cut himself short to say, “In case of doubt, no.” Earlier Monday evening, Duterte said that people could still go to carinderias, or neighborhood eateries, to eat. But Año said: “Yung carinderia kung meron silang delivery service, okay ‘yun. Pero kung yung tao pupunta para kumain, hindi puwede ‘yun.” (If the carinderias have delivery service, then that’s okay. But if people go there to eat, that can’t be.) Grab’s food and parcel In a statement on Tuesday, Grab Philippines said it resumed its food and parcel delivery operations, GrabFood and GrabExpress, with a “skeleton delivery fleet.” “Upon careful assessment of the situation on ground and after discussing with our regulators, we have resumed GrabFood and GrabExpress operations as of 1:30pm today, March 17, with skeletal delivery-fleet,” Grab said. “The decision was made to support the food establishments that will continue to operate and maintain continuous flow of goods to serve the essential needs of Filipinos during these trying times,” it added. Grab Philippines said that delivery-partners “are advised” to prioritize safety and wear full GrabFood gear. Contact-less delivery will be implemented. “We will continue to exercise strict safety measures such as contactless delivery, temperature checks, increased cleaning frequency of delivery-bags, and more in cooperation with our merchant-partners,” Grab said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/254694-silicon-valley-locks-down-coronavirus/","title":"Staying safe, and sane, as Silicon Valley locks down due to the coronavirus","date":"Mar 16, 2020 12:11 PM PHT","snippet":"Across Silicon Valley, streets have emptied as the pandemic takes hold, with tech employees working from home and avoiding leaving the house","body":" PALO ALTO, USA – David Tollner gets text messages telling him when meals are placed outside the door of the family guest room, where he was banished after developing a cough. His wife Mitra Ahani is taking no chances as the coronavirus pandemic spreads in the United States – even though she knows her husband may have no more than a common cold. When Tollner returned to their home near Santa Cruz from a conference in Baltimore, she steered him directly to the shower, leaving doors open so he wouldn’t touch them, and wiped down his suitcase with bleach. When he started coughing, Tollner was relegated to a spare room. “I locked him in the guest room,” confirmed Ahani, a chief executive of a center that provides educational support for children with disabilities, who like millions in this tech-savvy region has shifted to remote work in response to the spreading coronavirus.  “He probably caught a little cold out there. But it scared the daylights out of him, and he needed that.” In an interview with AFP, Tollner wryly acknowledged his predicament. “I’m here in the dungeon waiting for food and water,” he said Friday. “I have been here for a couple of days now trying not to infect the world with something I don’t know I even have.” Tollner relies on his laptop and smartphone to run his law firm in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose. Like tens of millions across the United States – where school districts are closing one after the other and firms are massively encouraging telework – the family is avoiding going out; relying for daily life on many of the technologies invented or refined in the area.  Ahani orders most of what they need from an online grocery delivery service, wearing gloves and wiping down goods with sanitizer when they arrive. Flexibility… and isolation Martha Lackritz-Peltier, an attorney at nonprofit group TechSoup, is working from her home in Oakland, where her companions include two dogs and hummingbirds flitting about the garden. “Frankly, I kind of enjoy the flexibility of sometimes lying in bed with my laptop and working on my lap,” she said. “I love being able to sit outside and get some sunlight.” Remote collaboration platform Slack has been speaking with companies of all sizes about tools and techniques for employees to work together in real-time while being physically apart. (READ: What apps do offices need for an efficient work-from-home system?) “Isolation is one of the biggest threats to a team’s engagement and motivation, and it can happen silently day by day,” a company spokesperson told AFP. “Maintaining camaraderie, encouragement, and collaboration can make all the difference in the weeks ahead.” Ghostly Googleplex Across Silicon Valley, streets have emptied as the pandemic takes hold, claiming more than 50 lives so far in the United States. People were few and far between at the “Googleplex” in Mountain View midday on Thursday, a time when throngs typically stroll, sun or grab meals at the cornucopia of food trucks or cuisine stations on the tech giant’s campus. A Googler wearing eyeglasses with tiger-stripe frames stood alone in the shade of a tree near a daily “Block Party” lunchtime event for employees on campus. “At least the block party was a lot better today – there were no lines,” he said. At Facebook’s closed campus in the nearby city of Menlo Park, valets stood idle in mostly empty parking lots usually crammed to overfilling. Empty shuttle buses came and went from vacant stops. No one could be seen in the town-square style center courtyard at One Hacker Way, and birdsong was the only tweeting of note. ‘Stir-crazy’ Foot traffic was scarce in Palo Alto, a social hub for Silicon Valley as well as nearby Stanford University, which has suspended in-person classes. “The street has been quieter, but we have been busy all day,” ZombieRunner barista Zac Terrones told AFP while whipping up an oat milk latte. “I think people working are getting stir-crazy at home and coming in for a little pop. I’ve washed my hands about 200 times today.” Stanford students Ende Shen and Yaqing Yang, both 21-year-old juniors from China, studied at a table on the sidewalk. “We have communities on campus and some of them are kind of falling apart simply because of the health issues,” said Shen, who is from a city near Shanghai. Yang tries to stick to a routine, scheduling time to spend in the sunshine and study with peers such as Shen. “I think it is really important to be in contact with the world despite bearing in mind social distancing,” said Yang, who is from the capital of Sichuan province. “I also cook a bit more now; it helps me stay sane and feel I have less need to go to crowded spaces.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/rappler-blogs/254528-opinion-notes-supermarket-last-day-freedom/","title":"[OPINION] Notes from a supermarket on the last day of freedom","date":"Mar 14, 2020 8:47 PM PHT","snippet":"'There was a part of me that wanted to stand in front of the checkout aisles and shout at all the folks nursing their loaded carts: STOP IT!

We had headed there to buy ingredients for dinner – just one dinner, tonight’s dinner, just enough sinigang for two – but knew full well the bedlam we were about to face.   Since last week, and more so now that the coronavirus-borne lockdown is hours away, supermarkets and pharmacies across Metro Manila have been choked with panic-buyers, hoarding canned goods and packed snacks, whole liters of disinfectant and alcohol, and, inexplicably, rolls and rolls and rolls of toilet paper.   The end times, it seems, asks for maximum absorbency.   But it’s important to note that we had headed to Rustan’s Supermarket at Shangri-La Plaza mall, a high-end grocery catering to gated village residents and expats (we are neither, but it was the nearest spot to us at the time, and we are admittedly middle-class enough to get by).  A study in contrasts  It’s already unnerving to be in any kind of supermarket at the peak of a panic pandemic, but there’s something particularly sinister in the air when you know a lot of the people in these aisles will head back in cars to comfortable homes, to pantries that were full to begin with, to lives where money trouble means a failed business investment and not an empty wallet and a chorus of grumbling stomachs.  There was a part of me that wanted to stand in front of the checkout aisles and shout at all the folks nursing their loaded carts: “STOP IT! STOP BEING SO SELFISH! Andaming nagugutom sa mundo! I don’t care if you’re just looking out for your family! You should look out for EVERYONE! What the hell are you going to do with all that tuna?

And it wasn’t exactly because I felt pressured by the chaos, but because I knew what these hoarders were fearing the most.  The blind leading the blind  It wasn’t the virus. That was the least of people’s worries. There was something far worse, and that was the crippling uncertainty stretched out before them for who knows how long – an uncertainty over an uncertainty – because we have government officials who would rather baby an old man who literally cannot express a series of coherent thoughts, and were not fit for their positions to begin with, as they were chosen by said old man for their loyalty and not their competence. (READ: IN PHOTOS: Mass exodus before Metro Manila ‘lockdown’) And now the rhythm of our lives is at their mercy. And we don’t know what that will mean for us. We don’t know what will come of all this.

And we are aware of that, and accept that, unconsciously or not.   So while I was standing there amid empty shelves, staring at the last two cartons of eggs just waiting to be snatched in rabid triumph, I was trying not to cry.  Because this uncertainty, this chaos, and this selfishness, I realize, is nothing new to any of us.

Amid the coronavirus outbreak and the Metro Manila lockdown starting Sunday, March 15, these hardworking delivery riders are still committed to bringing restaurants’ meals straight to your doorstep, just with several safety measures in tow now – and as they should. Although ordering from home is what’s safer and more convenient at the moment, remember that ordering online also puts delivery riders and service providers at risk for exposure. Don’t forget to show your appreciation for their unwavering service, and limit your deliveries! FoodPanda’s precautions On Friday, March 13, FoodPanda sent out an email to their customers, informing them that they have “gone the extra mile” to ensure the health of both their riders and customers.  FoodPanda riders with any “slightest sign of illness” are advised to self-quarantine until all symptoms disappear. If a rider has traveled to at least one country on the “black list of travel destinations,” they are immediately placed on a 14-day quarantine.  FoodPanda has also implemented “hygiene practices” in all rider hubs, which include mandatory temperature checks twice a day for employees and regular checks for riders.  Working-from-home arrangements and conference calls are also in place for the office employees. A split team arrangement is also enforced to reduce person-to-person contact, and all business-travel trips will be suspended until at least the end of March. Sterilization of rider bags at the end of every shift are also strictly enforced. Riders are briefed to keep hand sanitizers with them at all times, and to wash their hands every two hours and after each time they handle food. They are also reminded of social distancing guidelines while in public transport. FoodPanda also encourages customers to switch to online payment instead to “keep unnecessary interactions to a minimum.” GrabFood’s safety measures Grab Philippines’ food arm GrabFood also posted a list of safety guidelines on their website to “ensure the health and safety” of their partners and their customers. Firstly, riders are asked to do a mandatory “self-check” of COVID-19 symptoms, which include “fever, cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath.” If any are present, Grab riders are tasked to go offline and head to a hospital. If cleared of COVID-19, the disease brought by the novel coronavirus, a medical certificate is needed to prove that they are “fit for work.”  If any rider turns out to be a DOH-announced confirmed COVID-19 case, Grab will help provide compensation and medical assistance, as well as to those under DOH-mandated quarantine.  Grab reminds their riders to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, and have hand alcohol with them at all times. They must also spray the inside and outside of their delivery bag with disinfectant spray after every delivery, and practice “contactless delivery” –  leaving the customer’s order on top of the delivery bag, in front of their door, or at the building’s reception, move away 6 feet, and then wait for the customer to get their order.  Grab also encourages GrabPay, their cashless payment system, as much as possible. If cash is the only way, customers are advised to place it an envelope and leave it for the rider to pick up. Grab delivery-partners must have regular temperature checks, and are advised to strengthen their immune system, avoid touching their faces, use a face mask, and cover their nose and mouth when they sneeze or cough. – Rappler.com Order your favorite 8 Cuts Burger now with this GrabFood promo.

A few years after launching their transport services in the Philippines, they saw an even bigger opportunity to improve people’s lives. From “GrabTaxi”, they went with just “Grab” to complement their renewed ambition –  to be an everyday, everything app.  Today, whether you’re referring to how you’ll get home or where you’ll get food (Mag ga-grab lang ako), the word “Grab” has become synonymous with convenience. RJ Cabaluna, Grab Philippines’ country marketing head, said that he’d describe 2019 as a year that GrabFood and GrabPay have grown so much.  GrabFood just celebrated their 1st anniversary last November yet with the milestones that they’ve achieved, having been recognized by a global market research firm as the most used food delivery platform in the Philippines, it’s as if they’ve been in the playing field long enough to know what makes every Pinoy tick.  This inspired GrabFood Philippines Head EJ dela Vega and his team to amp up their efforts to provide more economic opportunities for Filipinos. Now, they’re in more than 37 areas in the Philippines including Laguna, Pampanga, Metro Cebu, Bacolod, and Iloilo. This means that Grab currently has more than 10,000 merchant-partners that range from luxury restaurants, fast-food chains, down to mom-and-pop stores and Makati’s famous Jolly Jeeps.   24 Chicken, one of the recognized breakthrough merchants at Grab’s first Golden Lunchbox Awards credits GrabFood for their increased revenue. “When GrabFood was introduced to us, our sales doubled or sometimes even tripled. From 1 branch, we now have around 10 branches in two years because of GrabFood. We weren’t expecting an influx of customers but with Grab, we now serve more customers than before,” said Jeff Uy and Jeff Sy, owners of 24 Chicken.  2019 is also the year Grab launched Grab for Good, a social impact program that aims to empower MSMEs and promote financial inclusion.  In a report they released last September,  9 million people in Southeast Asia are now using the platform to earn an income and grow their businesses. Alicia Laqi, owner of Sisig sa Rada, one of the Jolly Jeeps in Makati, said that GrabFood has helped her increase her revenue by allowing her to reach more people. “While the queue for my food already reaches far beyond a normal line, my revenues rose sharply because of the addition of GrabFood. It helped complement my already popular small stall and allowed me to earn more without adding a new branch,” she said.  Aside from providing jobs and helping microentrepreneurs expand their businesses, they’ve also started offering loans to driver-partners and MSMEs to help them grow their businesses or get them through emergency expenses.  Another innovation GrabFood is also proud of is the launch of GrabKitchen. GrabKitchen offers customers an on-demand delivery and in-store dining experience through a self-order kiosk. They offer users in a particular city a variety of food selections in one kitchen.  They opened a branch in Glorietta 2 and partnered with the following merchants: Omakase, Mister Kabab, 24 Chicken, Recovery Food, Frank and Dean, and CoCo Fresh Tea and Juice.  GrabKitchen helps MSMEs reach more clients without incurring additional costs. While cloud kitchens are usually delivery-only in nature, Grab Philippines added the dine-in experience knowing that Filipinos love to eat together and share their food.  Grab Philippines is also making waves through GrabPay. Now that customers can pay for their GrabFood deliveries, shopping items and groceries, bills and utilities, and more using the platform’s cashless payment method – the GrabPay wallet, more Filipinos are now ditching cash for a hassle-free transaction. For Jonathan Bates, head of GrabPay, this is their way of helping reduce the number of unbanked Filipinos or those who don’t have their own bank accounts.  Building on the idea of Grab being no longer just about transport, Bates, says that their goal in 2020 is to bring the convenience of cashless to as many Filipinos as possible. Thanks to their partnership with SM Investments Corporation (SMIC) and other partners, it has begun. Today, GrabPay can now be used to pay for GrabFood deliveries from over 10,000 restaurant partners, more than 5000  shopping, grocery and food outlets nationwide such as SM Stores, Starbucks and more, and pay for bills and utilities. Bates plans to make this platform available in cities outside the metro and eventually make Grab a 100% cashless app.  While Grab Philippines’ ambition has evolved, their passion to make an impact on communities remains the same.  With their expansion, Brian Cu, Grab Philippines president, recognizes the important role they play in addressing socio-economic challenges. May it be about championing financial literacy, giving safer transportation or offering additional income streams, he vows to help more Filipinos both living inside and outside Metro Manila thrive this 2020. For Cu, everyone can grow with Grab.   Cu and the rest of the executives of Grab Philippines are dedicated towards creating an impact by leveling the playing field and improving the quality of life for everyone. – Rappler.com   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/252525-italy-announces-deaths-linked-coronavirus/","title":"5th coronavirus death in Italy as infections mount","date":"Feb 24, 2020 7:57 AM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) The head of the country's civil protection agency, Angelo Borrelli, says 219 people have now tested positive in Italy, which has the most confirmed cases in Europe","body":"   CASALPUSTERLENGO, Italy (3rd UPDATE) – Italy reported Monday, February 24, its fifth death from the new coronavirus, as the number of people contracting the disease continued to mount and officials called for calm.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said that residents could face weeks in lockdown in an effort to sit out the virus. Angelo Borrelli, head of the country’s civil protection agency, said 219 people had now tested positive in Italy, which has the most confirmed cases in Europe. (READ: Second person dies in Italy from coronavirus – ANSA) Five people have died of the virus in the past 4 days, including one in the Veneto region. An Alitalia flight from Rome was being held in Mauritius Monday, after 40 people from Lombady and Veneto were told they could not disembark unless they consented to being placed in quarantine. Alitalia said it was arranging for their immediate repatriation instead, despite none of the passengers showing any symptoms. Eleven towns – 10 in Lombardy and one in neighboring Veneto – are under lockdown, with some 50,000 residents prohibited from leaving. Regional authorities have ordered gathering spots, such as bars, restaurants, cinemas and discos to close. The spread of the virus has disrupted high profile events including Milan Fashion Week and the Venice Carnival, while Serie A football matches have been postponed. Operas have also had to be cancelled at Milan’s famed La Scala. Masses in churches across the affected regions have been cancelled and funerals limited to immediate relatives only. The stock market in Milan was down nearly 5.0% on Monday in a broad-based sell-off over virus fears. ‘Outbreak in hospital’ Most of the cases in Italy are in Lombardy, a prosperous region in the country’s north where Milan is located, They can be traced back to a 38-year-old man in the town of Codogno whom authorities have called “patient one.” Investigators are reconstructing minute by minute the man’s movements over the past few weeks – where he slept, ate, walked – in a bid to trace everyone he could have come into contact with. “We had the most unfortunate situation possible; the outbreak of an epidemic in a hospital,” infectious disease expert Massimo Galli told the Corriere della Sera daily. “Unfortunately, in these cases, a hospital can turn into a frightening amplifier of contagion,” he said. The 38-year old patient had not travelled to China and doctors failed to treat him with the necessary precautions. The man initially believed to have given him the virus after returning from Shanghai later tested negative. “We still do not know who brought the coronavirus to Codogno,” Galli said. ‘Extremely difficult to track’ Simon Clarke, Cellular Microbiology associate professor at Reading University in England, said: “It seems that the virus can pass from person to person without symptoms, making it extremely difficult track, regardless of what health authorities do.” “While it remains the case that most people who become infected will have light symptoms or none at all, such uncontrollable spread would present a serious risk to vulnerable individuals.” Fontana urged residents to stay calm and stop panic buying. “Rushing to stock up on food doesn’t make any sense. There are enough supplies.” Milan mayor Beppe Sala echoed his plea, saying: “Rather than dashing to the supermarkets to grab food, perhaps we should spend time looking after the most vulnerable, such as old people, who are particularly at risk.” Schools have been closed as a precaution in Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia Romagna and Friuli Venezia Giulia. Piedmont shares a border with France, while the other regions neighbor Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. France has said there is no need to close borders in response to the spread of virus in Italy. Hungarian authorities issued a warning to citizens travelling to northern Italy, asking them to postpone their trip if possible, while incoming passengers will be screened at Budapest and Debrecen airports for fever symptoms. Croatia meanwhile suspended all school strips to Italy for a month and advised against travel to Lombardy and Veneto, Italian media reported. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/250953-opinion-chinese-filipino-teen-racism-coronavirus/","title":"[OPINION] A Chinese-Filipino teen speaks out on racism and the coronavirus","date":"Feb 5, 2020 1:19 PM PHT","snippet":"'I have never seen the Chinese be more sorry just for being Chinese. I have also never felt more ashamed for having a Chinese family name.'","body":"  I never really felt that being Chinese-Filipino was any different from being a pure-blooded Filipino. I call the Philippines my motherland; I respect, more than any other, the Philippine flag; I memorize both the Panatang Makabayan and national anthem by heart; I speak Filipino as well as any other fellow Juan; I love eating sinigang and lechon; and I have always embraced our polluted, traffic-choked, sweltering Metro Manila streets as home. But recently, I found this notion crumbling whenever I would see fellow Filipinos, whom I have always considered family, treating each and every Chinese national (including those originally from the Philippines) with disgust and prejudice because of the sudden mass outbreak of the novel coronavirus (nCoV). Indeed, the virus originated from the city of Wuhan in China, but China being ground zero for the virus has resulted in numerous adverse effects for all of its citizens, the most rampant of which is (extreme) xenophobia. In the past few weeks, unfortunate stories of Chinese individuals all over the world, including the Philippines, have constantly been making rounds on different social media platforms. I see and hear of Chinese nationals being shunned and treated with utter disgust for being who they are. All individuals who “look” Chinese are ostracized and stayed away from. Many are also refused basic services such as cab rides and the use of certain facilities such as public comfort rooms and elevators. Once an individual is classified as Chinese, no matter what their citizenship, he or she is automatically denied these rights. (READ: [OPINION] Like us, the Chinese are victims of the virus and a despotic government) Selected schools and offices have also issued a notice for mandatory self-quarantine that singles out only Chinese individuals. Recently, Adamson University was mired in controversy because of this issue. Many more stories like these abound, both locally and internationally. I have never seen the Chinese be more sorry just for being Chinese. I have also never felt more ashamed for having a Chinese family name.  As a Chinese living in the city of Manila, which serves as a home to many Chinese locals in the country and houses renowned hospitals (e.g. San Lazaro Hospital and Metropolitan Hospital – which both reported and confirmed cases of the coronavirus), discrimination, however disheartening, was to be expected.  Recently, I noticed how some Filipinos have become more wary of me. For example, when staff at food establishments ask for my name and I tell them my family name, they always seem to give a certain look or make an awkward pause. Similarly, the other day, when I went to the grocery store with my mother and she spoke in Chinese, I noticed how the people around us looked our way, when in the past it didn’t matter. So I just put my head down and hurriedly spoke in Filipino to show them that I was from the Philippines – that I’m Filipino, like all of them, and free from the virus.   Through this whole ordeal I have constantly felt that Filipinos have this ridiculous and untrue notion that Chinese families such as mine all feast on exotic mammals at home, like how they perceive those in mainland China, and that we could thus carry the virus and infect them. Instead of doing proper research on the topic to curtail its spread and help the masses be aware and alert of the virus, some Filipinos choose to blow things out of proportion and throw their own baseless opinions here and there.  I see posts on Facebook claiming that being infected by the virus equates to automatic death, when in fact Chinese public officials have stated time and again that although the virus has a high contamination rate, its mortality rate, on the other hand, is very low. In fact, most of those affected make a full recovery and the others who died didn’t not because of the virus per se, but because of old age or other ailments that compromised their immune system. Public health experts also noted that panic over the virus outside of China is “unproductive and unwarranted,” asserting that there are reasons for hope during the coronavirus outbreak. (READ: WHO launches campaign against China virus misinformation) First, the virus was identified and determined more quickly than ever before. Chinese authorities had already sequenced the virus and shared it with laboratories around the world only a week after it was discovered. Second, advancements in medical technology since the discovery of coronaviruses in the 1960s have allowed clinical laboratories and virologists to conduct thorough research into the way these viruses work.  Fear will not stop the spread of the virus and will only lead to negative social impacts. Instead, the public should take precautions to avoid getting sick, with the most effective preventative measure being everyday actions such as increased handwashing, avoiding face touching, and steering clear of contact with anyone who is sick.   In the middle of the coronavirus outbreak, along with keeping up with news regarding any development with the epidemic, I find myself re-evaluating what it means to be a Chinese-Filipino in the Philippines. Having lived in the Philippines the entire 17 years of my existence, I have never considered being able to function normally, in its most basic sense, as a privilege. Walking the streets peacefully, hailing a Grab ride, ordering food in my name, speaking in Chinese to my family in public places – all of these were mundane tasks that were simply part of my daily life, and which I considered basic rights.  But the masses’ reaction to the recent Wuhan coronavirus outbreak made me realize that there lingers a divide between Chinese-Filipinos and pure-blooded Filipinos despite having shared one home country for hundreds of years. It dawned on me that my view of Filipinos as a family might have only been one-sided, and that the notion is not shared by everyone.  Experts claim that a cure for the coronavirus is in rapid development. It is my hope that we may also soon see an improvement in cultural acceptance wherein all individuals, no matter what race or nationality, are treated with empathy and respect (and not ostracization) even and especially during times of crisis. – Rappler.com Col Tiu is a Chinese-Filipino grade 12 senior high school student and a proud Manilenya."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/243249-bubble-x-experimental-milk-tea/","title":"Bubble X: Manila’s newest experimental milk tea","date":"Oct 24, 2019 5:11 PM PHT","snippet":"Bubble X is a delivery-only milk tea brand in the Philippines with a mission to master the art of milk tea concoction","body":" MANILA, Phillippines – Heads up!

We believe education should be accessible to everyone, specifically, tech and digital literacy,” said Andrea Della Mattea, president of Microsoft Asia Pacific. “This encourages ingenuity, computational thinking, and problem solving skills, all of which are key to the future.” Grab claims that over 6.6 million workers across the 6 major Southeast Asian countries are going to require reskilling by 2028. Approximately 41% of that number reportedly lack relevant IT skills that new jobs will demand. To narrow the digital skills gap, Grab and Microsoft are combining their resources and ecosystems to fulfill their shared vision to make the economic opportunities in technology accessible for people in Southeast Asia. They aim to train a total of 20,000 people in the region by 2025. There are 3 ways the partnership plans to achieve this. One is by partnering with select universities across the region to train students with technical skills that are in demand by industry. Microsoft will provide the learning materials, curriculum, and certifications, as well as Azure for Education, a platform that provides students access to developer tools for applications; while Grab will facilitate learning experiences such as hackathons and internships. Grab has yet to announce which schools they partnered with. Another way is by providing Grab driver partners access to Microsoft’s Digital Literacy certification program, which has basic courses covering topics such as computer basics, using the Internet, and productivity software. The driver can be awarded a Microsoft certification for free upon completion of the course. These will all be available in the driver’s Grab app. Grab and Microsoft will also help drivers interested in pursuing a career in tech by letting them enroll in a practicum-based curriculum developed by the nonprofit organization Generation: You Employed, or receive certification in Microsoft proprietary courses. Those who will graduate will have opportunities to work for Grab and Microsoft partner companies in technology-related roles. “If the private sector actively creates programs for local communities, technology can be within reach for many, and the learning of new skills can immediately improve the livelihoods for many more people in Southeast Asia,” said Anthony Tan, CEO of Grab. Meanwhile, Grab plans to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro-entrepreneurs running mom-and-pop shops by digitizing their business and having them integrate the platform’s services so they can reach a bigger market. They also plan to provide them economic access through loans and lending services that can give them the capital they need to scale their business In the Philippines, Grab will start with Jollijeep mobile food stalls by offering them access to GrabFood food delivery and GrabPay cashless payments to help them grow and compete with newer restaurants. The project is expected to kick off within the year and will be expanded to other traditional and home businesses moving forward. The other flagship initiative that was announced is called “Break the Silence”. It looks to champion inclusivity by offering differently-abled people such as those who are deaf and the hearing-impaired an opportunity to earn their own income by becoming a Grab driver partner. At the event, Grab announced they will expand the initiative to Indonesia and Singapore and enhance it in countries where it’s already running – like Thailand and Malaysia. The company currently has over 500 deaf driver partners on the platform and plans to double this number over the coming year. The initiative currently cannot work in the Philippines as the Land Transportation Office does not issue professional driver’s licenses to people who are deaf or have other disabilities. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/228999-grabpay-now-offered-sm-cinema-ticket-purchases-april-2019/","title":"GrabPay now offered for SM Cinema ticket purchases","date":"Apr 25, 2019 8:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Consumers may either purchase their tickets at the cinema or on the SM Cinema website using GrabPay","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Moviegoers can now buy SM Cinema tickets using Grab Philippines’ mobile wallet GrabPay.

Fans of Frankie’s New York Buffalo Wings’ already know the value for money and quality they’re getting every time they ask to be put on that crazy waiting list, but how many really know the brains and brawn behind the big brand? Friends from high school turned business partners, the resto’s three founders, Eduardo Que Firmalo (president), Kevin Te (vice president), and Bin Tañedo (chief financial officer), built the household name from the ground up in September 2012, starting with their first branch in City Golf Plaza, Ortigas.  Since then, 6 years was all it took for the business to boom, now with 7 branches around the Metro, over 400 employees, and a well-known, widely-loved name within the food industry. Ed, Kevin, and Bin sat down with Rappler for a candid conversation on the inevitable holiday Frankie’s rush, the importance of proper time management, their personal family traditions, if chicken is still their favorite holiday food, and how being new fathers has changed both their personal and professional lives.   Christmas as a peak season for Frankie’s Ed: For sure Christmas is peak season, especially when it hits the “ber” months palang. “Ber” months are our peak, and December especially. Our mall branches will really peak because of the foot traffic, everyone’s buying Christmas presents, so talagang we have to make sure we’re prepared for that holiday rush. Rappler: How do you control the crazy lines? Even when it’s not peak season, there’s almost always a line.  Ed: We add manpower to make sure the speed of the food and service isn’t compromised. Logisitically, we prepare talaga. Our people have to go over time, or we add people to make sure we have enough wings to give the stores.  That’s another issue we have to constantly monitor – the supply of the chicken wings. The demand is really great! Not all suppliers can produce wings that big. We have to make sure we have enough supply. We constantly deliver, even more than once a day to one store, just to make sure they have enough chicken. The logistical support and the manpower is what we have to make sure we have. Definitely, our sales increase by a good margin by the “ber” months, but December talaga.  Kevin: Especially din because of the extended mall hours, since we have to comply too with the mall. Like now, we’re until 11pm.  Ed: We add support talaga to our mall branches. Our SM Aura branch, our fourth/fifth store out of the 7, in terms of sales, come December, jump to the 3rd or 4th spot, even if it’s a small mall, since everyone’s shopping. Come December, it becomes a totally different store. The people are non-stop, the lines are long. Our top performing branch is still the one at Crossroads BGC and Megamall. City Golf is third. UP Town Center is fourth. Performance also depends on the seating capacity.  Kevin: We also have Foodpanda, and we have Grab Food now! Shameless plug (laughs).  Finding time to enjoy the holidays amidst the business rush Ed: During the earlier days of Frankie’s, we had limited capital and manpower, so back then, during the holidays, we’d work sagad, until December 24. Now that have more people helping us, we can now enjoy the luxury of time to balance work and personal life. We also make sure to rotate our staff’s schedules so our people can also spend time with their loved ones.  Bin: First of all, it’s family, of course. We have to spend time with our parents. One thing we also make time for is our group of friends and classmates. He organizes our Christmas party every year (points to Ed). For Frankie’s itself naman, it’s our annual Christmas party.  Kevin: We actually just had it last Monday. We close all the branches in the evening and open late the next day. Ed: We give out a lot of awards to our guys, so they get surprised and motivated, like Employee of the Year or No Absences or Ironman of the Year.   Kevin: It’s actually a fun time during our Christmas party. We always have themes. This year was 80’s, last year was Gatsby. We’re all in costumes. What I love is everyone’s so game, everyone dresses up talaga. The presentations they go all out. Ang galing! It’s really a fun thing to see their love and dedication. Before nga eh, we were only 8-12 people, which was a simpler time back then. We’d have it in Seafood Island in Eastwood, and then in our Kapitolyo branch, but now that we’re bigger, almost 400 employees, we had to move it to a bigger venue outside.    Work-life balance during the holidays Ed: The holidays is the only time we get to spend straight days with family.  Bin: In the start though, it was really hard to balance.  Ed: Kaming tatlo, we all got married the same year, in 2015.  Kevin: I was first, they followed me. (laughs) Ed: Then we had our kids shortly after. Kevin: Our kids are all the same age pa. Ed: Kaya before the holidays, I have to make sure everything is all set. We make sure to have a healthy rotation, para everything’s fair for everybody. Before, I’d work 12-16 hours a day, even on Sundays. But now, since we’re parents and have a family, you have to be able to find a way. These kids, they really grow so fast. Otherwise, you’ll wake up one day and your kid knows how to speak na. How did they know how to do this? You don’t even realize when you saw that or how it’d happen. That’s one thing we realized. So now, I’m more strict with myself that I have to be home in time for dinner, before my son goes to sleep.  Before I’d work until 10-11 pm. Now it’s a non-negotiable that I have to be home for dinner. We’re at that age where we have to find the time to balance.  Bin: Before, our schedule was up to 16 hours of working, and then we’d drink and party after. (laughs) So we just changed the drinking and partying part to family time.  Ed: When you’re younger talaga, you have energy pa.  Kevin: Now you can’t go home at 4 am. 3 am nalang. (laughs) Ed: At least now, with our families, we’re a bit more stable, so we can balance it more.  What they look forward to during Christmas Ed: Well, my birthday is December 24. It’s a one-celebration thing. It’s about spending my birthday and Christmas with family. Family, at the end of the day, is what I really look forward to. It’s just a few straight days in a year with my immediate family – parents, siblings, nieces, nephews, my wife and kid.  Bin: When you have a kid in the future, spending time with him, seeing him playing around, even if you’re doing nothing, its worth the effort of taking time off your busy schedule and spending it with your kid. You work hard for the extra time spent. At the end of the day, it’s really coming home to him and just spending time together. It’s fun. It’s good and relaxing downtime when you’re stressed from work and you see your kid.  Ed: During the holidays, everyone else is also on break. No one is bothering us as well. On a normal work day, even if you say, “I’m gonna take this day off for my family”, you’re going to get texts and calls. Holidays are pretty quiet.    Must-do holiday traditions and practices  Ed: Earlier on, when I was struggling, I couldn’t afford to buy any gift for my family members. When we started doing better, I made it a point that when I felt there was something my family needed something, I would go out of my way to get it for them and make sure I have something to give on Christmas Day. It was years of being a student and being a broke businessman, so it’s a good feeling. Bin: More than presents, we prioritize food in our family. We prepare talaga. Before, when our place was still small, we’d just have Mcdonalds and Jollibee for Christmas. This time, we make sure we have good food.   Kevin: I have a lot of family traditions. We have Secret Santa every year, we usually go out of the country – our entire clan is more than 30 people. This year, we’re just staying here, which is honestly a good break. Christmas is all about spending time with family and friends. I plan a lot of Christmas parties too with different groups of friends. Best gifts they’ve ever received Ed: Sorry kung cheesy, but my son was born on the second week of November. By Christmas 2016, we were learning pa how to deal with having a child. Sorry kung cheesy, but my kid is definitely the best gift I’ve ever got.  Kevin: Mine too. My daughter was born 2 days after his son.  Bin: No particular item, but nowadays, as I grow older, spending time with family is the gift. I don’t really mind material things more than the company. Every year, that’s the gift. Kevin: As a kid, Christmas came slow. Nowadays, everything is fast. I can’t believe 2018 is almost over. At this point, it’s all about one of the most valuable things for me, which is time. It’s what you do with time that matters. Spending it with family is enough.    On their favorite holiday food (that isn’t chicken) Ed: Mine is weird, because I love Japanese food. This has been running for 10 years na, because I have this favorite sushi from a small grocery in Katipunan. Come Noche Buena, since it’s almost my birthday, my mom will order 200 pieces for everyone of that California Maki. To this day, I really look forward to that.  Kevin: This Starbucks drink, the Peppermint Mocha. I usually have 7-8 planners at the end of the year, because I like the drink so much, not because of the planner. I like coffee, but I don’t usually drink Starbucks, except during Christmas. Come November 2, when they first release the holiday drinks, I have this baby at least once a day. I can do up to 3 times a day, for every day of the holiday season. I have 5 planners na, nakatambak lang.    Their ultimate Christmas wish Bin: Me, I want another baby. I want a girl.  Kevin: For business it’s always going to be a prosperous and successful business. Ed: We hope that even though this has been going strong for 6 years, that it will continue to flourish for the next decade or so.  Kevin: It’s cheesy also, but it’s true. Honestly, as a dad, I just want a nice, healthy, wonderful life for my daughter. That’s all that matters. Your priorities and perspective change when you’re a parent. That’s the best wish I can hope for.  Also, if you could let people know, our newest branch in Kapitolyo is now open since August! It’s the first Frankie’s stand-alone restaurant that we built from the ground up.  Ed: Our Molito branch in the South is opening soon, too!    – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/216180-grab-launches-food-service-crave-city-bonifacio-global-city/","title":"Grab launches food service, brings ‘Crave City’ to BGC","date":"Nov 7, 2018 10:27 PM PHT","snippet":"The service is available in Metro Manila and is currently being tested in Cebu City and Mandaue in Cebu with over 4,000 restaurants to choose from","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In a bid to be the “everyday super app,” Southeast Asia ride-hailing giant Grab officially launched “GrabFood” on Wednesday, November 7.

In a statement on Thursday, September 27, Grab said it is expanding its mobile wallet services “GrabPay” to include bills payment, food orders, and in-store and in-restaurant purchases. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas granted the firm a license to operate as an electronic money issuer in August. Grab is among the 11 non-banks with EMI license so far. “With the support from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we can now help millions participate in the cashless, digital economy without the need for a bank account or to download additional apps,” said Ooi Huey Tyng, managing director of GrabPay Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Users can load their GrabPay through online banking, bank deposits, credit card payment, or paying at convenience store 7-11, Cebuana, or directly to an eligible Grab driver. Currently, GrabPay can be used to book rides, send package deliveries, or to top-up one’s mobile prepaid load. The firm said it is still working on the integration of mobile payments for food deliveries.

The update, expected to roll out in the Philippines by Q3 this year, completely overhauls Grab’s home screen to incorporate newly introduced features and services. First thing Grab users will immediately notice is that the home screen no longer contains the booking map. Instead, users will see an overview of Grab’s services including food delivery, mobile payment, and their flagship ride hailing service now called transport. The new app will also feature the recently introduced Grab Daily news feed that contains news, reviews, and other content. Grab said that with the help of a machine learning artificial intelligence (AI), the feed can be personalized. What the AI does is it collects data based on a number of things like places you frequently visit. It then uses this data to curate the content that pop ups on your feed. For instance, it can suggest restaurants near your office. On top of this, Grab announced that Yahoo would be providing news content for their feed in Singapore, Malaysia, and Philippines.

As you may have noticed, the complaints in social media already declined,” he added. According to Cu, lesser income drove the unwanted behavior. Grab assured drivers that they will continue to receive subsidies “as long as they need money.” On June 19, the company announced that it has started to provide subsidy for trips that fall below P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour, in response to the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to suspend the P2 per-minute travel charge.  Grab said the subsidy scheme would cost around P100 million a month. Meanwhile, the company has branched out to food and grocery delivery services.  Cu said there is “great potential in the Philippine market” to launch Grab Assistant and Grab Food. Grab Assistant, which can be accessed through the same ride-hailing app, allows customers to request for drivers to buy anything they want up to P1,000 and have it delivered to their doorstep. The feature is available in Metro Manila, but is more reliable in certain areas such as Ortigas, Bonifacio Global City, and Makati City.

In a time of war, she is one of hundreds to have received medical attention at the makeshift animal clinic in Kafr Naha, an opposition-held town in Aleppo province. “If you want to show mercy to people, start by showing mercy to everything else,” says Jaleel, who runs Ernesto’s Cat Sanctuary – named after his favorite furry friend. The 43-year-old, who grew up in Syria’s second city Aleppo, has been mad about cats since he was a boy. As a young adult in the city, he would drop by the butchers on his way home from work as an electrician to ask for scraps to feed street cats in his neighborhood. When war broke out in 2011, he put down his tools to become an ambulance driver to help ferry the wounded – but never stopped bringing food to his feline friends. As the war raged on and cat lovers fled the city, Jaleel was left with 170 cats to feed and a new nickname: the Cat Man of Aleppo. With the help of donations from friends and social media fans, he set up his first cat sanctuary in the city. But in late 2016, the regime ramped up its deadly bombardment of Aleppo’s opposition-held neighbourhoods as it sought to regain control of the whole city. “We started fleeing from neighborhood to neighborhood until, in the end, we escaped the city altogether,” Jaleel recalls. Sukhoi, the cat  Determined not to leave them behind, he and fellow feline fans managed to save 22 of the city’s cats. “We gave each family two cats in a plastic vegetable basket,” Jaleel says. Among them was Sukhoi, named after the stealth fighter jets of regime ally Russia. “He would zip in and grab food from right under the noses of the other cats, just like a Sukhoi jet,” he tells AFP. Syria’s war has killed more than 350,000 people and displaced more than half its pre-war human population, as well as many of its domestic animals. After fleeing Aleppo, Jaleel set up his second shelter – named after Ernesto – in early 2017 and housed 18 of the 22 smuggled cats in the animal oasis. “The cats don’t just stay in just one house. They swap with each other and sleep in all of them,” Jaleel says, referring to rows of marble cubes with cat-sized entrances, engraved with names like Pouncer and Rose. Nearby, a grinder churns out streams of bright pink mincemeat that is then scooped out onto plates spread out on the ground for lunchtime. Eyes closed, a cat with a stripy, light ash coat dips its snow-white nose in, nibbling away. But the shelter, financed by online crowdfunding campaigns, does more than provide twice-daily meals: it also serves as an animal clinic with its in-house vet. “We treat all sorts of animals here for free: horses, cows and even chickens,” Jaleel says. During an inventory in January, he and his colleagues discovered they had handed out 7,000 medical prescriptions for free in less than a year. ‘Really beautiful’  Mohammad Watar was blown away when he brought in his cat for treatment after food poisoning. “There are no vets where I live. I asked people and they pointed me to the sanctuary,” he says. “I was so surprised to find this kind of thing existed during this war we’re all living,” says Watar. “I saw them treating all sorts of animals. It’s really beautiful.” Still, war is never far away: the sanctuary’s main building bears the marks of gun fire. Last month, it cancelled a children’s party after a young boy was shot near the shelter, according to its English-language Facebook page. Footage posted online depicted a man in a cat sanctuary t-shirt carrying a child with blood streaming down his calf. Even the shelter’s cats are treated for war wounds, says the center’s vet, Mohammed Yusuf. “Just like many people are wounded by all the different weapons in the area, animals too suffer the same injuries,” he tells AFP. Some stay under observation at his clinic for weeks, but not all get the treatment they need. “We’re living in a war and facing severe shortages of veterinary medicines for wounds as well as vaccines,” Yusuf says. In a time of death and destruction, the pride of the sanctuary is its ability to carry out sonograms of animal mothers-to-be. “We examine them and diagnose how many foetuses there are and when they are due, and we prepare to welcome the new births,” Yusuf says. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/201222-w-mall-opening-pasay-city-photos/","title":"IN PHOTOS: W Mall opens in Pasay","date":"Apr 27, 2018 5:10 PM PHT","snippet":"The new mall along Macapagal Boulevard has a Waltermart, a Miniso, a Kidzoona, and many more","body":" MANILA, Philippines – W Mall, a Walter Mart Community Mall, opened along Macapagal Boulevart, Pasay City on Thursday, April 26.

In the way of worldwide food trends, not a lot comes new to the Filipino market. It’s no surprise that Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern flavors have slowly taken over the Western food scene, with flavors and twists that we all know and love winning over hearts and palettes. Yet SMPFCC, along with its partners and some of the country’s most renowned chefs – Heny Sison, Emelita Galang, Rosemarie Lim, Sylvia and Ernest Reynosos-Gala and Gene Gonzales – excite and entice appetites with a breakdown of the predicted trends for the year. Bigger is best  Bold flavors and extreme indulgence are clearly the names of the game when a 12-inch burger laden with a foodie’s most outrageous dreams comes into play. Colorful angus sliders take centerstage for the devout carnivore, while innovative flavor combinations take the sweet, spicy, and savory to whole new levels and put a much-needed spin on the classic chicken lollipop. Take-away takes over  Millennial or not, the Filipino is always on the move. With people across every age demographic growing into a more educated, health-conscious consumer base, it’s easy to understand the rise of pre-packaged and calorie counted meal delivery services, the popularity of food that’s easy to grab and eat on the move. Healthy options are prioritized, along with a healthy dose of spicy flavors, as seen with the packaged salads, perfect for storing in the refrigerator or prepared the night before, and with honey chili habanero chicken poppers served in convenient sugar cones, ready to grab and go.  According to Chef Heny Sison, it’s about “reviving old recipes and elevating them” while still adapting to new technologies; food that offers comfort and convenience with the thrill of the delightfully unexpected.  Borderless cuisine  Chef Gene Gonzales cites travel as a large factor in 2018’s coming food trends. He predicts the rise of “borderless, global cuisine,” what with rising exposure to new and exotic flavors. The culinary year is slated to experience a crossover between cultures: European techniques with Asian and Middle Eastern ingredients, as with the flavors like African Harissa and Morroccan spices preserved through the low-temperature sous vide cooking method. Tradition with a twist  The millennial penchant for all things nostalgic is also slated as a driving force on the Philippine food scene, according to Chef Ernest Reynoso-Gala. Younger chefs abroad are becoming more daring, and while the rest of the world is being introduced to the flavors of our culture, local chefs and restaurants are forging ahead by putting modern spins on heritage Filipino cuisine. Along with the classic lechon kawali served in a mouth-watering paella, San Miguel Pure Foods introduces their new Heat & Eat line of products with bone-in and boneless crispy pata served with 3 sauces that represent Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao – kare-kare, humba, and piyanggang. The standard sinigang was also reincarnated to perfection with a fresh pomelo twist. Bread on the rise  These days it’s possible to eat for wellness and beauty, but look forward to doing so and indulging at the same time. While Japanese breads lead the way into organic and artisanal desserts like the savory Hokkaido, the more colorful but no less delicious sweet end of the spectrum takes inspiration from Mexican conchas.  Infused croissants and donuts take on a new spin with flavors like matcha and ube, providing a less-guilty dessert experience, and smoothie bowls are expected to be the new poke by marrying the desire for a healthy meal and the necessity for convenience.    Crafted cocktails at home  Loud and proud in the way the Filipino does best, gin cocktails and local ingredients set the trend when it comes to drinks for any occasion. Ginebra San Miguel, which is a juniper-based alcohol, is perfectly paired with a wide variety of flavors, especially local ones like calamansi, dalandan, guyabano, lemongrass, mango and pomelo. The possibilities are endless for do-it-yourself home mixologists. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/science/189328-artificial-intelligence-story-not-data/","title":"I am story, not data","date":"Nov 23, 2017 7:00 PM PHT","snippet":"'We live and die as stories, not as data'","body":"Three days ago, I was face to face with “Alter” and it was not just looking at me, it was sensing me and its environment.

What you see is a humanoid that moves, not quite like a human does, but you get a sense that it is no longer mechanical, that it is alive in its own right, even if in the place of a beating heart, it has “coupled pendulums” that mimic neural signals. I participated in the Science Center World Summit held last week so in that same day, I also listened to the Chief Scientist of Hitachi, Kazuo Yano, with great optimism, about the role of AI in promoting human well-being. He is involved in AI technology that examines the link between human happiness and movement. One big finding he revealed was that people in call centers who are active, are able to sustain their activity more, and report (through the sensors they were fitted with) being happy more than those who stay at rest more. The goal of this study was not to measure happiness per se but to link it with productivity since it has been pretty much established in studies that happy people are more productive. It would have been so easy to accept the robust link between productivity and happiness if human productivity only included call centers or sales performance. An Italian researcher, Daniel Archibugi, who sat in the same panel as Dr. Yano, did raise a challenge to the latter as to what we will do with poets whose obvious productivity, as seen in their works, are, in great part, attributable to their inner capital: “unhappiness”. In a session that I moderated, I had presenters who demonstrated technologies like Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, robots and learning trackers not only as they are today but what they would probably look like at least 10 years from now. Maholo Uchida, the one in charge of the robots in Miraikan, spoke of their robots as members of their team, even taking great care of the humanoids when they would be lent to other institutions, to the extent of having fashion and hair stylists for these humanoids. Towards the end of the summit, I had a chat with the first Japanese astronaut, Dr. Mamoru Mohri, who also headed Miraikan – the science museum of new and emerging technologies, especially AIs. At the summit, he showed us videos of when he was in space looking at the Earth, giving us a keen sense that the Earth was indeed a lonely planet – there is no neighboring planet that could save it or save us. He was born of the Earth and as an astronaut, has risen above it to contemplate it and to share that wisdom with the rest of us, who most likely will remain grounded. He possessed this wisdom that also seemed unabashed to welcoming AIs as complementing human lives. He noticed my earrings. I was wearing a pair of astronaut earrings given as a gift by someone whom I treated like my own son. Dr. Mohri pointed to them and said “Is that Asimo?” (Asimo is the Honda resident robot of Miraikan.) I said, “No, Dr. Mohri, it’s you.” My head spins imagining our common future with AIs. AIs are the chief sense-makers of what has come to be called “big data” that everyone wants to collect. My head did not just spin with the prospects that are already articulated in the news and current literature: “AIs will eliminate jobs”, “AIs will augment jobs”, “AIs will annihilate humans and the world”, “AIs will transform the world for the better”. I get worried when Stephen Hawking, who has contemplated the death of stars and planets and Elon Musk, a revolutionary technologist, rise as top voices that warn against an uncontrolled AI future. But my AI anxiety is also tempered when I hear Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg be more optimistic about what AI can do to make us better humans or a force for good. But then, there is also what critics too say about Musk and Zuckerberg standing where they do, because it is consistent with their branding. But even without the hyped debates of these tech celebrities, there is no escaping future days and nights with AI. Robots  do not only do backflips, or animate science museums. They are also now embedded in the pillars and peripherals of human work and life including transport (yes, ride-sharing apps like Uber and Grab rely on AI), defense, food, and commerce. In the future and some say in the near-future, self-driving cars and trucks will be familiar.  Food will be tailored and made according to detected requirements, and stores and supermarkets will be characteristically human-less, save for the shadow humans who designed the AIs that run them. I am fascinated by AI prospects.  I am also anxious about them. This is the nature of a non-AI. I am very conscious that I was not raised to look at machines as living but I also am aware that some cultures do not differentiate or they do not find it hard to look at AIs as a genuine part of human lives. I know that their view is as valid as mine. But maybe there are profound questions that we all can agree on posing, regardless of culture or level of technological development. Like any technology, AI could go spectacularly well in some aspects or gloriously fail us in others. But aside from those, it would also have unintended consequences.  Would we be ready to reverse the consequences if they do not turn out to be good? Just as an earlier study this year has shown, AI could also learn human biases and operate with them. Then, would AI just be a mere technological mirror of the human designers in First World countries and their own biases – a repeat of our imperial and colonial past? Will AIs be able to make imaginative leaps in thought and action that our most profound human stories are made of? Would an AI have made that leap that Einstein did, given data that was only Newtonian? Would slavery have been outlawed by AI given only data from slave owners? Would AI ever do the neural razzmatazz that would make it even come close to the literary and musical genius of say, a Lin-Manuel Miranda? Data is not narrative. It is only part of it. A narrative is a story we tell ourselves to keep ourselves together so we know who we are and can imagine who we can become, joined by all the other selves that we scoop and tuck in the folds of our own lifetimes.  We live and die as stories, not as data.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/174568-jollibee-photos-1000th-store-bonifacio-global-city/","title":"IN PHOTOS: Inside Jollibee’s 1,000th store","date":"Jul 3, 2017 8:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach joins Jollibee executives at the blessing and ribbon-cutting ceremony of the fast food giant's 1,000th store","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Fast food giant Jollibee will open its 1,000th store on Tuesday, July 4, and a ribbon-cutting ceremony and blessing was held at the special branch a day before.

Dalam persidangan ini, Jaksa Penuntut Umum menghadirkan 4 saksi untuk dimintai keterangan. Keempatnya yakni Novel Bamukmin, Gus Joy Setiawan, Muchsin, dan Syamsu Hilal. Salah satu saksi, yakni Sekretaris Jenderal DPD Front Pembela Islam (FPI) DKI Jakarta Novel Chaidir Hasan Bamukmin, menjadi pelapor pertama yang memberi keterangan. Novel juga membawa bukti-bukti dugaan penistaan agama yang dilakukan oleh Ahok. (BACA JUGA: Kesaksian para pelapor di sidang Ahok) Menurut Novel, dalam kasus-kasus penodaan agama sebelumnya, tersangkanya selalu ditahan. “Ahok ini satu-satunya tersangka dalam kasus penodaan agama yang lolos (tidak ditahan),” katanya. (BACA JUGA: Jadi saksi di persidangan, Novel Chaidir minta Ahok ditahan) Pada konferensi pers yang dilakukan usai persidangan, Ahok mengungkapkan keberatannya mengenai para saksi. Ia juga membeberkan kejanggalan pada Berita Acara Pemeriksaan (BAP) milik Novel. Ahok membacakan BAP Novel, dituliskan bahwa pada tahun 1992-1995, Novel pernah bekerja di restoran ‘Fitsa Hats”. {source} <iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frapplerid%2Fvideos%2F844043055699182%2F&show_text=0&width=400″ width=”400″ height=”400″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true” allowFullScreen=”true”></iframe>{/source} “Salah satu saksi mungkin malu karena kerja di Pizza Hut, punya orang Amerika. Di berita acara, tulisan Pizza Hut-nya itu dia sengaja ubah, saya pun sampai ketawa karena ketika ditanya akhirnya ngaku,” kata Ahok. Menurut Ahok, Novel berkata tidak memperhatikan apa yang ditulis di BAP, padahal setiap halaman harus ditandatangani.  Sedangkan, riwayat hidup ditulis langsung oleh saksi, bukan pihak kepolisian. Ketika ditanya wartawan mengenai motivasi Novel, Ahok kembali berkomentar, “Ya saya kira mungkin dia malu, karena dia mempunyai pandangan tidak boleh dipimpin oleh orang yang beda iman. Dari RT, RW, tidak boleh yang tidak seiman.” Pada Rabu pagi, 4 Januari, Fitsa Hats sempat menjadi trending topic di Twitter.

Montare Food Hub has 8 stalls each with its own unique theme or cuisine, similar to kitchen stations, said co-owner Kaye Tano. While Montare has less stalls than most food parks, it makes up for it in quality. According to Kaye, she and the other owners are very hands-on with the chefs at each stall, developing the dishes together. Montare is also an events place, perfect for parties, debuts, corporate get-togethers, or even intimate weddings. The stalls provide the food at the events too, but offer different menus for those. For everyday, here’s what you can try at each of the stalls in Montare. Caprizzo Pasta Hub Satisfy your Italian craving at Caprizzo, where they serve pasta with a twist. Try their sisig pasta (P180) or aligue pasta (P180) for a Filipino fusion, or their threaded spaghetti (P200), where the noodles poke through bits of sausage!    They also serve Hungarian sausage and German franks pasta in red or white sauce for the same price (P150).   Peci At Peci, grab finger food like wings, shrimp, and fish, perfect for dipping in their sauces. Try their buffalo wings in New Orleans sauce for P150, or their “Shrimp in a Bag” – prawns covered in salted egg sauce – for P230.   Bourgignon Creaving for some steak? Bourgingnon’s got you covered, with their T-bone steak (P195).  Heat Stroke Grill While everything at Heat Stroke Grill is – as its name implies – grilled, the stall still offers up a lot of variety. Their pork belly comes with spicy rice and chimichurri sauce (P150), while their chicken with yellow annatto rice and teriyaki sauce (P150).   Also try their grilled pork belly binagoongan (P180) or their grilled kebab (P160) for a Middle Eastern twist.   Ribdibs Ribdibs’ pulled pork soft tacos (P150) and cheesy pork quesadilla (P110) are perfect for sharing, but you can get a whole pork chop and rice meal too, with the American Chopper (P140).    If you’re feeling extra hungry, go for the big guns – the Ribdibs Duo (P440), with a rack of ribs plus two sides.  Montare Dim Sum Kitchen Kaye, who used to work in the hotel industry, said she found some of the chefs now working at Montare from there – including the chef at Dim Sum Kitchen. If you’re craving for great dimsum in the Marikina area, look no further. Try their beancurd roll (P110) – stuffed with meat, not shrimp – shrimp and pork siomai (P110), Japanese siomai (P100), Shrimp pinsec (P130), and chicken feet (P70).      For a full meal, go for the wanton noodle soup (P150).  Tux Burger at Montare The nachos (P130) at Tux Burger are delicious and perfect for sharing, or grab a roast beef sandwich (P190) or Golden Eye burger (P190) for yourself.   Montare Dessert Hub There’s only one dessert place at Montare and they’re serving up churros (P98) and beautifully crafted specialty milkshakes. Try the tiramisu (P150), nutty caramel (P150), or taro (P150).     – Rappler.com Montare Food Hub is open everyday from 3 pm to 12 am. It’s located at Lot 12 centro de Buenviaje Commercial, Mayor Gil Fernando corner Aquilina Sttreet, Sto Nino, Marikina City."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/135426-southeast-asia-travel-budget-guide-itinerary/","title":"Southeast Asia budget guide: 4 countries, 23 Days, P33,000 all in","date":"Jun 5, 2016 9:15 PM PHT","snippet":"A detailed budget itinerary by traveler Jayson Concepcion shows the complete expense breakdown of his trip, which cost him P33,000 for a full 23 days of travel","body":" Dreams will always be dreams unless you actually do something to achieve it. This is what I always remember every time I want to achieve something in life. Five years ago when I was working in Vietnam (I was no traveler back then), my Filipino friend and officemate invited me to travel to the Cambodia-Vietnam border to check out the casinos (I didn’t gamble) and food there. While waiting in queue at the immigration line, I noticed that there were lots of foreign travelers lining up, including their kids. My friend said they were backpacking and further explained that some of them taught English from one country to another to sustain their long-term travels. Well of course you all know that teaching English is not the only way to earn money while backpacking. Fast forward to some years later, I got bitten by the travel bug. I remembered that time in the border. I researched in it, read lots of articles and blogs on traveling Southeast Asia then actually traveled to Thailand and back to Vietnam for 5 days each. I was hungry for more.  Then the opportunity came that I could have a one-month break from the corporate jungle. I instantly recognized it and booked the flights immediately; we went on a trip around Southeast Asia for 23 days.  This dream of mine has now come true and I would like to share how we did it. In this post you will see our budget, itinerary and guides so you can plan your trip, too. Our route  Our route is not the common backpacking route that you see in other guides or blogs. In this trip we skipped Vietnam since 1.) I’ve already worked there in Ho Chi Minh last 2011 2.) We went back in HCM last 2014 3.) I wanted to see other places in Vietnam besides HCM so I’m saving that trip for a different backpacking route sometime in the future, hopefully. Ours is a combination of Indochina destinations plus Singapore and Malaysia. Please see route below: I wish we could’ve squeezed Batam, Indonesia in the mix too, but I’ve already booked our AirBnb stays in Malaysia and SG so it was a no-go for now. Next time. Itinerary In this trip, we wanted to focus more on Thailand so we allotted 14 days in Thailand alone, but please note that we didn’t do much temple touring in Thailand as we already did that in our first trip back in 2014. And we all know Singapore is an expensive country, so we just stayed there for 2 nights. We stayed in the airport on the first night since our arrival in Changi was around midnight. You will also notice that there are days that are not as packed because it’s either we were in the market or food-tripping or just simply resting and saving money. Day 0  Day 1   Day 2 Day 3 Day 4  Day 5  Day 6  Day 7  Day 8  Day 9  Day 10 Day 11  Day 12  Day 13  Day 14  Day 15  Day 16  Day 17  Day 18  Happy Songkran! Day 19  Day 20  Day 21  Day 22  Day 23  Transportation Compared to other backpacking routes, I think ours is more expensive as we needed to fly to SG from Manila then fly from KL to Phnom Penh. Plus we booked a round trip flight to Chiang Mai from Bangkok (heard of derailing trains but we could’ve tried the night bus instead). Anyways, here are the modes of transportation we used to go from one country to another. I will detail the transportation for each country in their separate posts. We carried 50L and 35L backpacks. Both are allowed as carry-on baggage so we didn’t check it in anymore. Manila to Singapore Airline: Cebu Pacific Fare: P3199.5 each (no check-in baggage) A little expensive for low promo fare standards because I booked this just 2 months before our trip. As I mentioned earlier, this trip was kind of unexpected. Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Since we stayed in Yishun, we opted to go to Kranji station which is in the same line and 5 stops away. So go to Kranji station, board the purple orange buses SBS 170. It will drop you at the immigration to exit SG. Fare 1.75 SGD. Once your passport is stamped, board a bus going to Johor Bahru (SBS 170 or the Yellow bus). Fare 1.5 SGD. Enter Malaysia immigration. Board SBS 170 again to go to Larkin Terminal to ride a bus to KL or other parts of Malaysia. Fare 1.80 SGD. In Larkin Terminal, there are lots of buses going to KL. Just choose the cheapest. We paid 30RM each from Larkin to TBS Terminal in KL. Don’t worry, cheaper here doesn’t mean your bus is a hellhole. We rode a nice air-conditioned bus with ample legroom and the driver was not a speeding maniac either. Kuala Lumpur to Phnom Penh, Cambodia Airline: Air Asia Fare: P1409.26 each (no check-in baggage)  Phnom Penh to Siem Reap Night Bus: Giant Ibis Fare: $15 + $1 online processing fee This is a sleeper bus and if you are sure with your date of departure or schedule, then it’s better to book it online so you can reserve your bed. Yes, your bed inside the bus. It was comfortable and they have a decent toilet (Use it only when you really need to). It also gets really cold inside the bus. They do provide blankets but it may not be enough so we put on our jackets while sleeping. Siem Reap to Bangkok Bus + Mini-van combo: Capitol Tours (capitoltourscambodia.com) Fare: $10 Travel Time: 9 hours including immigration exit/enter at the border The bus was ok, but the mini-van is a little cramped. They have Wi-Fi on board though. At the border, they will give you a sticker. Don’t ever lose that sticker. Stick it on your shirt. After exit in Cambodia (right side), you go to the left side of the Thailand border for immigration entry. Once finished, the Capitol tours staff will look for people with the sticker that was given to you. They will guide you to the terminal near 7/11 where you will take the van. If you are planning to take only a bus/van/taxi to Poipet (Cambodia border), then you can just look for a bus/van in the terminal/car park near 711 in Aranyaprathet (Thailand border). I have read guides that you can also hop on a casino bus to Bangkok from here. Bangkok to Chiang Mai (Roundtrip) Airline: Air Asia Fare: P3,427.01 each (no check-in baggage) If you want to lessen your expenses and wouldn’t mind travelling for long hours (I think 10 hours or so), you can also take a night bus from Bangkok and vice versa. Fare ranges from 500 to 600 THB. Almost all guesthouses and hostels offer this. You can just approach the receptionist. Bangkok to Manila Airline: Cebu Pacific Fare:  P4557.11 each (no check-in baggage) Same reason with our flight to SG. A little expensive for low promo fare standards. Accommodation Below is a quick list where we spent our nights. N = night(s) e.g. 1 night is 1N Singapore: 1N Changi Airport Entertainment deck – Free 1N Airbnb in Yishun Ave 11 c/o Poh Heng Anthony Malaysia: 3N AirBnb in Jalan Enggang c/o Hairuddin Phnom Penh: 1N Top Banana Hostel  Siem Reap: 2N Rosy Guesthouse Bangkok (First 3 nights): Lamphu Guesthouse (2N) Lamphu Guesthouse (1N) Chiang Mai: Julie Guesthouse (3N) JJ Guesthouse (2N) Bangkok (Last 6 nights): Lee Travel Inn (4N)  Lee Travel Inn (2N) TIP: If you’re traveling during summer to these countries, then consider booking air-conditioned rooms as much as possible. Some hostels and guesthouses’ fan rooms can’t cope with the heat just like in Rosy Guesthouse in Siem Reap. We felt like we were inside an oven there. Tours We didn’t book many tours in our trip. Almost all of the places we went to are DIY trips and free (or with cheap entrance fee). Some don’t require you to hire a cab/tuktuk because you can just walk to it which we mostly did. I’ll just list below the key places we went to for each country and insert some helpful remarks. Please also note that we didn’t do much “touring” in Bangkok as we already did that in our last trip there back in 2014. Singapore: Raffles Place/Fullerton Hotel vicinity, Merlion Park, Esplanade, The Helix, Marina Bay Sands Hotel vicinity  Gardens by the Bay Malaysia Petronas Twin Towers Batu Caves  Phnom Penh Killing Fields and S21 Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum Siem Reap Wat Preah Prom Rath Angkor Wat/complex Short cycle tour   Bangkok Wat Saket (Golden Mount)  Songkran Festival  Chiang Mai Wat Phra That Doi Suthep  Doi Pui Village Wat Chedi Luang and Wat Phan Tao Thai Cooking class by Asia Scenic  Food In this Southeast Asia trip, just like in our previous trips, we were also focused on eating and trying different kinds of dishes along the streets, bus terminals, hawker stalls and food courts. There were just times that we had to buy biscuits or bread in convenience stores/street for tomorrow’s breakfast since most of the shops/food carts aren’t open early in the morning. We like to be up early and eat immediately so we needed fast access to our food. Singapore: Where else? Hawker stalls of course! Luckily, there are hawker stalls near our accommodation in Yishun. We had an amazing Char Siew Noodle for 4SGD and Roasted Chicken rice for 3SGD.  Just eating in these Hawker stalls will let you experience the food and culture of Singapore. Malaysia (KL): The very first time we tried Malaysian food is in Larkin Bus Terminal. It was a Roti Telur for breakfast for just 2.2 RM! It already includes a big delicious curried chicken breast. In KL, you can have amazing food in food courts like the ones in KL Sentral, KLCC mall and Central Market. We love their Nasi Gorengs or any of their fried rice dishes! A dish usually cost around 4 to 6RM. Pretty cheap for such delicious dishes. Don’t forget to try their Teh Tarik (hot milk tea) / Teh Sejuk (cold milk tea) too.  Of course, there are also those mom and pop eateries and street food in the sidewalks of KL. We had the best mee hailam (6RM) just a 3 minutes walk from our accommodations! It is a noodle based dish with vegetables and seafood drenched in dark soy-oyster based sauce. Fantastic dish! For breakfast, lots of vendors are selling Roti Canai, an Indian-influenced flatbread where you can dip in curry sauce. Amazing food, so be sure to grab one of those. Malaysian food is usually spicy but very delicious. Even if you don’t like spicy food, I’m sure you’ll appreciate the taste. Their fried rice dishes are not that spicy anyways especially the Nasi Goreng Cina that is more like a Yang Chow. And if you are looking for pork, you’ll find that they seldom sell pork dishes there as they are predominantly a Muslim country. Cambodia: In all honesty, we didn’t like Cambodian cuisine that much. Compared to their neighboring countries Thailand and Vietnam, theirs pales in comparison for us.  They have a dish that is similar to Com Tam in Vietnam. It is composed of white rice, grilled pork, fried egg, soup and condiments. It was good and cheap ($1) but compared to Com Tam, theirs are on a different level. We also tried their traditional Khmer dishes. First in the list is Fish Amok ($2.25). Again, it’s ok but nothing spectacular about it. After our Angkor Wat tour, we found a mom and pop eatery and ordered another set of Khmer dishes. We ordered a Beef Lok Lak ($3) and Cambodian salad ($2.5). The saving grace of our food trip in Cambodia was in the night market (near the river) at Phnom Penh. It was street food galore! You choose your food from the stalls then you let them cook it while you sit in one of the mats laid there. It was a fun experience though every stall there is no different from one another. But hey, even the locals love it! We loved it!  And oh, beer at Pub street in Siem Reap is ridiculously cheap at half a dollar! Thailand: What we love about Thailand is you can almost get delicious food everywhere! Here’s our take on some of the foodie places we went to: Soi Rambuttri/Khao San Road – Lots of Pad Thai stalls ranging from 30 to 60 TH and eateries offering Thai food in the 40 to 80 THB range. If you had enough of Thai food, then there are several Western restaurants catering to big spenders. You can also check the nearby streets for noodle soups, fruits, etc. Chiang Mai Walking street night markets – nice street food there. Lots of variety. Stalls near Chiang Mai gate also offers Thai dishes. Terminal 21 food court – oh my, the best ever! Dishes here are very cheap ranging from 25 to 50 THB! And cheap doesn’t mean they aren’t delicious because they are! Lots of variety too. We dined here like 4 or 5 times. The food court in MBK is no match to T21 when it comes to price and quality. MBK food ranges from 45 to 100 THB.  Chatuchak Weekend Market – nice variety of street food and Thai dishes. There’s always a refreshment stall nearby because it can get very hot during midday! Soi Convent in Silom – When we visited, there weren’t too many stalls. But we still managed to eat some street food like fried shrimp spring rolls and fried chicken with tamarind dipping sauce. We didn’t like Hoi Tod that much though. Of course, there are your trusted mom and pop eateries everywhere. Just take a look at what they offer and if it looks good, then eat it! Expense summary Here is a summary of our Expenses in our 23 days Southeast Asia backpacking trip. Please note that shopping items and souvenirs were not included as this may vary per individual preferences.  Also not included is our travel insurance of P2,358 per person; insurance is recommended, not required. Food and drinks were shared between the two of us. I will further expand the details of expenses in my separate post for each country. Please note that I converted the currency to Philippine pesos using www. xe.com.  For 32,756.44 per person for 23 days with flights in between, it’s definitely not bad. You can even lower it further by taking the bus to Chiang Mai, squeezing your travel to 10 to 15 days or just doing Vietnam-Cambodia-Thailand instead. Also note that we didn’t do much temple-hopping in Bangkok since we did that already in 2014 where we visited the Grand Palace and its neighboring Wats and the Ayutthaya-Bangpa-In Palace combo. – Rappler.com Jayson Concepcion is a programmer by profession but has a soul of a traveler.

Mosende’s Story” will be launched on Thursday, April 28, at 6 pm at the Filipinas Heritage Library, Ayala Museum, Makati.  The photographs are by Rick Rocamora, foreword by Rene Ciria-Cruz, and essay by Dan Amosin. The coffee table book was designed by Ben Molina, and Black and White images printed in tritone by CGK formaprint. Rodallie S. Mosende grew up homeless since birth on Paterno Street, Quiapo, Manila, Philippines. She was a child beggar at a time, grabbing food from strangers when hungry, and hustling for vegetables and meat from vendors when her mother was sick, promising to pay them back when she got older. She was a street sweeper until her sophomore year in college to earn extra money for transportation and food. Being poor and living on the street, coping with classroom requirements requires a different set of skills. She learned to study using candles, streetlights, and while in college, staying late to use the library, its computers and printers to finish her assigned work. Because of documentary photographer Rick Rocamora’s practice of sharing his visual stories of his subject with anyone who would like to take a look, a benefactor who insists on remaining anonymous offered to support Rodallie’s college education with a monthly stipend to cover her other expenses. While they now have a small rented room, Rodallie continues to sleep on the street to accompany her mother watching her merchandise and vending stall. Rodallie also serves as a tutor to other school kids who live on Paterno Street, and a role model for street children. Rodallie, now 22 years old, graduated on April 23, 2016, with a degree of Bachelor of Science in International Hospitality Management and a specialization in cruise line operation in hotel services from Lyceum University of the Philippines, Manila Campus at PICC in Manila. (READ: From street child to Atenean: The story of Rusty) With a future job in the cruise industry waiting for her after graduation, she will have a comfortable place to sleep and the amenities of a home for the first time. Hopefully she would be able to earn enough to lift herself and her family out of poverty. Rodallie is an inspiration to many Filipinos, a great example of survival against difficult odds in life.  Rick Rocamora on Rodallie’s story Five years ago, I started visiting Quiapo with more frequency, intent on documenting the heart and soul of its residents once described by noted writer Jose “Pete’ Lacaba, as the Armpit of the Nation. (READ: Life’s arcade: Quiapo) Poverty is written all over Quiapo; it’s one side of the divide between rich and poor that fractures Metro Manila. The streets are overcrowded and navigating them is an acquired skill. While the area is well known for the availability of hard-to-find goods, repairmen, and food ingredients, many fear shopping there. During the Feast of Black Nazarene, instead of focusing on the procession, I directed my attention to events happening on the side streets away from the armada of photographers that descends on Quiapo during the fiesta every year. To find the truth and educate others, I dug deeper into the lives of my subjects in Quiapo, learning each of their life histories, challenges and anxieties. I also worked hard to find unique voices among the residents and frequent visitors to the district.  The real story of Quiapo is not about crime and filth. Those in the know see Quiapo in a different light: as a haven for strong-hearted, hardworking individuals tenaciously trying to overcome life’s obstacles for their dreams.  I hope that you find inspiration from the images and stories of these ordinary Filipinos who are determined to make life better for themselves and their families. I did.

The country’s tabloid newspapers have had a field day, with headlines including: “Seagull stole my iPhone” (The Sun), “Moment killer seagull turns cannibal” (The Daily Mail) and “Psycho seagullskeep out illegals” (Daily Express). Even the broadsheets have joined in, with The Sunday Times warning that “Gull gangs learn new tricks to steal your seafront snacks.” The squawking menaces have always had a bad reputation as scavengers. But the gulls are now apparently growing in audacity and rather than feeding on leftovers, are deliberately targeting people’s fish and chips, the battered haddock or cod combination traditionally eaten by holidaymakers, as they tuck in. “They’ve been trained by terrorists, I’m sure,” said Cliff Faires, owner of a seafood kiosk in the historic south coast resort of Brighton.  A sign outside his Brighton Shellfish and Oyster Bar warns: “Seagulls will snatch your food. Please be aware. We don’t take any responsibility for this action”. ‘Never been so bad’ Local witnesses described a common plan of attack used by the birds, whereby a lone assailant pounces on an unsuspecting diner, forcing them to drop their food. At this point, hordes of reinforcements arrive to feast on the food. “They’ll eat everything except lemon and tabasco,” one added. “I see gulls grabbing food from people 3 or 4 times a day, more when it’s sunny,” said Chris, who works at a fish-and-chip kiosk on Brighton pier. “The worst thing I’ve seen is one landing on the head of an old lady who had a hot dog. She obviously dropped it, and the same gull took it away really fast. The woman was terrified,” he told Agence France-Presse (AFP). “It’s never been as bad. This is the worst year,” said Jack Messenger, from the Sea Haze Bar, another beachfront restaurant. “It’s probably best for us, because when the seagulls eat their food, they (the customers) come and get more,” he joked. It is not only seaside towns that are suffering, with inland cities such as Bath and Bristol reporting problems.  Experts blame a combination of factors for this summer’s Hitchcockian events. They include gulls becoming more accustomed to living close to humans and the birds being particularly aggressive in July when they have young in their nests. Three pets have been pecked to death by seagulls in southwest England in recent months: a turtle, a chihuahua and a Yorkshire Terrier. “Blood was coming out of his head. It was like a murder scene,” the Yorkshire Terrier’s owner Emma Vincent told reporters. Hysteria ‘not justified’ Even Prime Minister David Cameron has swooped into the debate. “I think a big conversation needs to happen,” he said. “Reading the papers this morning about how aggressive the seagulls are now in St Ives, for instance, we do have a problem.” It is forbidden to kill seagulls, so the only way to fight them is to destroy their eggs or release birds of prey to hunt them. Tony Whitehead, spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said he “didn’t think the hysteria is justified.” “There is an issue… but to demonize the whole species off the back of a few incidents, I don’t agree with that,” he told AFP. Pete Rock, an expert on urban gulls, called for further study using advanced technologies instead of destroying their eggs.  “They know everything there is to know about their home range, where all the food is, and where to go and mate,” he told AFP.  “What we don’t know, is what they know, and the only way to find that out is to use satellite telemetry.” Laura Mayes, a councillor in southwest England, highlighted another problem encountered with nesting gulls. “What has really affected us is noise. They fly over the houses of the neighbors crying 24 hours,” she said.  “No way we would allow neighbors to have parties all night, but that’s exactly what it means to have gulls living near people.” – Alfons Luna, AFP/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/101746-harvard-asia-pacific-conference-manila/","title":"Back in MNL: Harvard’s largest student conference in Asia-Pacific","date":"Aug 6, 2015 12:55 PM PHT","snippet":"After a 21-year absence, the Harvard – Asia conference goes back to Manila with the theme 'Confronting Asia's Development Challenges through innovation'","body":" This is a press release from the Harvard Project of Asian and International Relations: MANILA, Philippines – After 21 years, the Philippines is once again hosting one of Asia’s most exciting youth gatherings. De La Salle’s Project of Asian and International Relations (DLSPAIR) will kick off the 2015 Harvard – Asia conference on August 20 in the Shangri-La Hotel, Makati after a 21-year absence. This year’s theme is “Confronting Asia’s Development Challenges through innovation.”  Every year, the Harvard Project of Asian and International Relations (HPAIR) holds two academic conferences, one in Harvard itself which is held every February, and one in Asia, which is held every August.   Since 1991, Harvard has been bringing together students from all over the world and leaders in the fields of Academics, Business, Health, Finance, Diplomacy, Security and many more. Together they look to fulfill the conference’s 3 goals:  During the 5-day conference the students are exposed to various issues related to politics, economics, culture and business.  This year, DLSU-Manila was chosen to be the partner university. “We want to redefine HPAIR’s standards and bring the conference closer to the issues and problems discussed throughout the conference” said Jonathan Beltran, Executive Director of DLSPAIR.  “We also reinvented the conference experience through increased participation of sponsors and companies throughout the Philippines,” Beltran added.   BDO and The Ayala Corporation will have company sponsored case studies, wherein representatives from the company are present to personally explain the cases. This will be done for the first time in this year’s Asia Conference. The conference will consist of 7 different panels and their corresponding themes: The conference will include special events like International Night, Manila Night, Entertainment Night, field trips and mixers for delegates and speakers.  This year’s HPAIR-Asia Conference will be held at The Makati Shangri-La from August 20 – 24, 2015.  “MANILA2015,” in partnership with Banco De Oro, would not be possible without our academic partners, De La Salle University and Asian Institute Management, our sponsors, Ayala Corporation, Philippine Airlines, RFM Foods Corporation, Grab Taxi, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, Globe Telecom, Phinma, Go Negosyo, and Security Bank, and our official media sponsors, Rappler, When In Manila, ANC, Animo Magazine, RX 93.1 and Magic 89.9.” – Rappler.com For more information, you may visit its official website. "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/97168-things-ph-learn-from-singapore-food-culture/","title":"The Philippines can learn from Singapore’s food culture","date":"Jul 2, 2015 7:35 PM PHT","snippet":"'We need to invest in the right physical and cultural infrastructure to celebrate Filipino food'","body":" There’s more to Filipino food than just Jollibee. I’ve used this rebuttal a few times whenever I find myself educating foreigners about the diverse wonders of Filipino food. Even though I adore my crispy Chicken Joy just as much as the next homesick OFW (2 pieces, please!), I’m quick to defend our cuisine from being reduced to a single fast food chain or the ever mind-boggling delicacy of balut (developing duck embryo.)  I don’t blame these foreigners for what they do not know though. I can’t. For unlike our Asian neighbors Thailand and Vietnam, Filipino food is vastly underrated and underexposed in the international foodie scene. Pad thai. Beef pho. While many have savoured these dishes, few have known the joys of sisig or kare-kare.  It almost seems that even with our food, we’re always making the headlines, yet never fully harnessing the power of our potential. Almost three full years have gone by since the prophecy of popular American TV personality and chef Andrew Zimmern, who resolutely declared that Filipino Food was the next big thing.  Perhaps our recent ranking as the world’s second best food destination, according to the CNN Facebook poll, is a sign that the Filipino Food Movement is finally gaining some precious traction. But, I believe that it takes more than public opinion to really sway the world’s palates our way. Living in foodie haven Singapore and traveling frequently to other delightfully delicious destinations (say that three times fast!) within the region has helped shed light on what and how local cuisines truly make it abroad. The secret is a thriving food culture back at home and a local appetite so ingrained in the daily life of its citizens from all walks of life. Similar to building better airports to cope with the country’s spotlight as the next big travel destination, we need to invest in the right physical and cultural infrastructure to celebrate Filipino food. Here are four things I believe that the Philippines can stand to learn from Singapore’s food culture.  An authentic experience The humble hawker center is the epitome of what I love about Singaporean food culture. These markets house an array of individual vendors selling ready-to-eat street food from small booths.  But most importantly, it’s a shared public space that simply doesn’t give a damn about who you are and what you do, as long as you bring an appetite for cheap, authentic local food.  Anyone, from the gray-haired tissue vendor to the corporate exec, is welcome to have breakfast, lunch, dinner and everything else in-between here. And yes, supper too. The Filipino carinderia is similar to a hawker center, but unlike Singapore, it doesn’t transcend race or class. Not everyone feels safe eating kanto (street) food or grabbing lunch from the sari-sari store. While markets like Mercato or Legazpi Village exist, their doors are simply not as accessible to those who are not in the upper-middle class or higher.  A taste of history Often, the first place I bring friends visiting Singapore is Lau Pa Sat – a popular hawker center converted from a historic building, one known for its graceful colonial architecture.  Given the rich history of the Philippines, with its gorgeous churches and majestic forts, why not preserve old buildings as monuments to our local food instead of tearing them down? Not only will tourists and locals get a taste of Filipino food, they’ll also get a generous helping of Philippine culture on the side too. A melting pot of Filipino cuisine Singapore is, quite literally, a tasty melting pot of different cultures.  Endless stalls of local delights also serve as gastronomic ambassadors for the 3 main ethnic groups in the country – Malay, Chinese and Indian. Filipino cuisine is even more diverse – with influence from the Spaniards, Americans and the various local flavors from over 7,000 islands.  But unlike the relatively tiny city of Singapore, the Philippines is a vast archipelago. Unless you make it a point to visit other provinces, one could live out entire lives without being exposed to the sheer breadth of Filipino cuisine. But what if you could bring these provincial flavors to the bigger cities? Since Manila is the top tourist gateway into the Philippines, why not make it the culinary capital of authentic Filipino food from all over the country?  Example of reimagining local food. Right side: Eggs benedict on prata bread. Left  side: White and dark chocolate champorado.   Rediscovering the Filipino foodie Part of what feeds the foodie industry is being able to reimagine traditional food in new ways or reinvent the experience of eating your favourite food. Take the popular brunch culture in Singapore for example. While inspired by the British, it has become a permanent weekend fixture for both locals and expats. Could we not develop a brunch culture in the Philippines as well? Dishes like adobo, tapsilog and tocino do make for a perfectly hearty brunch meal. Some Singaporeans have even tapped into the trend by adopting classics like eggs benedict but replacing the muffin with prata, a flour-based pancake. Perhaps we can do the same with a pandesal? This is but one of many ways we can help Filipinos rediscover their old favorites. The Philippines has all the right ingredients to become a truly international foodie destination. So long as we can cultivate a homegrown cultural appetite for local cuisine, global tastebuds will soon follow. All we need to do is stir the pot in the right direction. – Rappler.com   Rica is a ‘foreign filipina,’ born in Indonesia, raised in the Philippines and working in Singapore.

The north of the west African country borders the area in northeastern Nigeria where a violent Boko Haram insurrection has killed more than 15,000 people since 2009. Starting last July, the jihadists began launching cross-border attacks, initially just hit-and-run strikes to grab food, Rochdi said. But the attacks soon escalated with the militants burning villages and killing people, and, by the end of the year, kidnapping children. “The information I have is around 1,500” have been taken since then, she said, adding that they were mainly used as servants, to help carry tents and fetch water. Children on the frontline  At the height of the attacks in northern Cameroon in February, Boko Haram deployed children on the frontline, Rochdi said. “To my knowledge, the children were used as human shields … (and) were aged between eight and 12,” she said. In those attacks, which are no longer taking place, the children were backed by locally recruited youths, with hundreds of heavily-armed militants taking up the rear, she added. “The worst was the children… Obviously this created a horrible situation,” she said, adding that many Cameroonian soldiers had been deeply traumatised by having to face children on the battlefield.Rochdi said it remained unclear if the children were from Cameroon, Nigeria or elsewhere. A four-nation fightback by Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon halted the attacks for a while, but Rochdi said the jihadists had resumed weekly cross-border hit-and-run style attacks. “We don’t feel in Cameroon that it is over at all,” she said. While hailing new Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s commitment to eradicating the group, she voiced concern that the onslaught might push more jihadists into Cameroon. That would be disastrous for the country, which is already struggling to accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees from Nigeria and conflict-ravaged Central African Republic, in addition to nearly 100,000 Cameroonians displaced since the Boko Haram attacks began, she said. Some 240,000 Central Africans have taken refuge in Cameroon since the conflict in their country escalated in 2013, joining nearly 100,000 already there, and around 70,000 Nigerians have flooded in since last year. This has put huge pressure on resources in a country already hit by recurring natural disasters like floods and droughts, which have left more than a million Cameroonians wondering where their next meal will come from. More than 200,000 children in the country were  malnourished, Rochdi said.She warned that the UN had received just 31 percent of the $264 million it had appealed for to help Cameroon this year, resulting in cuts to food rations and to education programs. She appealed to donors to step up their efforts, warning the multiple humanitarian crises in Cameroon were creating “fertile ground for recruitment for Boko Haram.” Rochdi cautioned that without more help, Cameroon risked “becoming a real threat to the stability of the whole region.” – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/67917-iraqi-forces-offensive-after-breaking-jihadist-siege/","title":"Iraqi forces press advance as parliament stormed","date":"Sep 2, 2014 10:22 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The military gains came as a senior UN rights official says ISIS jihadists had carried out 'acts of inhumanity on an unimaginable scale' in Iraq, and caretaker premier Nuri al-Maliki vows the country would be the group's 'graveyard'","body":"AMERLI, Iraq (2nd UPDATE) – Iraqi forces made more progress Tuesday, September 2 in their fightback against jihadists, but in Baghdad anger boiled over as hundreds stormed parliament over the fate of missing soldiers who surrendered in June. After breaking a months-long jihadist siege of the Shiite Turkmen town of Amerli by Islamic State (IS) fighters, troops on Tuesday regained control of part of a key highway linking Baghdad to the north. Two towns north of Amerli were also taken from the jihadists on Monday as Iraqi forces – backed by US air strikes – score their first major victories since the army’s collapse across much of the north in June. That collapse left some 1,700 soldiers in jihadist hands, with many believed to have been executed. Demanding to know their fates, angry relatives stormed parliament in Baghdad, attacked MPs and began a sit-in in its main chamber, an official said. Anti-riot police were trying to evict the hundreds of protesters, who were also calling for some officers to be held accountable, said the official, who was present at parliament. Concern over those in jihadist hands has been fueled by reports of widespread atrocities, including accusations from Amnesty International of war crimes and ethnic cleansing. The Sunni extremist IS declared an Islamic “caliphate” in regions under its control in Iraq and Syria after it swept through much of the Sunni Arab heartland north of Baghdad in June and then stormed minority Christian and Yazidi Kurdish areas. IS has carried out beheadings, crucifixions and public stonings, and Amnesty on Tuesday accused it of “war crimes, including mass summary killings and abductions” in areas it controls.  ‘Wave of ethnic cleansing’  “The massacres and abductions being carried out by the Islamic State provide harrowing new evidence that a wave of ethnic cleansing against minorities is sweeping across northern Iraq,” said its senior crisis response adviser Donatella Rovera. The UN Human Rights Council unanimously agreed to send an emergency mission to Iraq to investigate IS atrocities, after a senior UN official said the jihadist group had carried out “acts of inhumanity on an unimaginable scale.” Concern over the scale of the humanitarian crisis helped prompt limited US air strikes in support of Iraqi forces, Shiite militia and Kurdish troops battling the jihadists. Such strikes were used in the area during the Amerli operation – the first time Washington has expanded its more than 3-week air campaign against IS outside the north. Desperate residents rushed to receive aid deliveries after Iraqi forces moved in to the town, scrambling to grab food and bottles of water from flatbed trucks. A day after seizing Amerli, troops and Shiite militiamen on Monday retook Sulaiman Bek and Yankaja, two towns to its north that had been important militant strongholds. Army Staff Lieutenant General Abdulamir al-Zaidi said they had continued the advance on Tuesday, regaining control of a stretch of the main highway to the north which had been closed by the militants for almost 3 months. A senior militia commander said it would be several days before the road reopened as sappers needed to clear it of mines and booby-traps planted by the retreating militants. The United States said it launched 4 air strikes in the Amerli area, meaning that it effectively supported operations involving militia forces that previously fought against US troops in Iraq. The government’s reliance on Shiite militiamen in this and other operations risks entrenching groups which themselves have a history of brutal sectarian killings. David Petraeus, a former commander-in-chief of US-led forces in Iraq, has warned against America becoming an “air force for Shiite militias”. But worries over the rise of IS seem to be outweighing other concerns, with Western leaders warning the group poses a security risk far outside the areas under its control. Demands for UN hostages Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Tuesday said that “extreme force” was justified against IS militants, describing them as worse than Nazis or Communists. “As soon as they’ve done something gruesome and ghastly and unspeakable, they’re advertising it on the Internet for all to see which makes them, in my mind, nothing but a death cult,” Abbott said. Fiji, meanwhile, revealed that Al-Qaeda-linked Syria rebels who are holding 45 United Nations peacekeepers hostage in the Golan Heights are demanding they be expunged from a UN terror blacklist. The Fijians, part of the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), were captured last Wednesday, August 27, when Al-Nusra Front rebels stormed a Golan Heights crossing. Another group of 75 Philippine peacekeepers refused to surrender and eventually escaped from two camps on the Syrian side of the demarcation line after the rebels besieged them. Fiji’s army chief Mosese Tikoitoga said a UN team had arrived in the Golans from New York to take over negotiations for their release. “Unfortunately we have not made any improvement in the situation, our troops remain at an undisclosed location, the rebels are not telling us where they are,” Tikoitoga said, adding that the hostage-takers also want humanitarian aid for areas they control and compensation for wounded fighters. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/65725-india-stray-dogs-security-squad/","title":"India stray dogs to be part of security squad","date":"Aug 9, 2014 5:04 PM PHT","snippet":"This marks the first formal plan in India's capital, New Delhi, to turn stray dogs into municipal security dogs","body":"NEW DELHI, India ‒ Stray canines roaming the Indian capital may soon find themselves attending police training school, with civic authorities planning to turn the animals into security dogs, reports said on Saturday, August 9. New Delhi residents have long informally adopted some strays as watchdogs and fed them, but this marks the first formal plan to turn them into municipal security dogs. Delhi authorities said they would enlist police animal trainers to work with the strays, and press the canines into service as guard dogs alongside a newly formed “May I Help You?” city security force which aims to assist the public and bolster safety. “If these dogs are going to roam the NDMC (New Delhi Municipal Corp) area, they might as well work,” the civic body’s chairman Jalaj Shrivastava told The Hindu newspaper. “Our plan is to adopt these strays and train them as guard dogs” to work with the public security force ‒ 40 officers have already been deployed with the city planning to engage as many as 700, he added. While some stray dogs are friendly and docile, others are more menacing, and there is a high incidence of dog bites in India. “This initiative is meant to address two issues: take the strays off the streets, thereby tackling the dog menace, and make the city safer for residents,” added Shrivastava. There are no recent figures on the number of dogs in Delhi, but a 2009 city survey put them at more than 260,000. The reports did not say how many dogs would be used in the security scheme. Dogs will be fed and vaccinated under the plan, welcomed by animal rights activists. “This will engage the street dogs with society and also benefit people,” Radha Unnikrishnan, an animal rights activist, told the Hindustan Times. A 2001 law forbids killing the roaming dogs and the stray population has soared, feeding on India’s infamous mountains of street garbage as well as on scraps given to them by residents. Hindus object to the killing of many types of animals. Cities across India already run sterilization and vaccination programs but an estimated 20,000 people die each year from rabies infections in India, over a third of the global total. The stray dog program is the latest animal initiative in New Delhi. A federal minister earlier this month announced authorities were deploying 40 professional monkey impersonators in government buildings to frighten away rhesus macaque monkeys which terrorise bureaucrats, invading offices, grabbing files and snatching food. The men mimic sounds of langurs, which were used to chase away macaques around Delhi for decades until authorities started enforcing two years ago a four-decade-old wildlife law that bans keeping langurs in captivity. ‒ Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/65084-watch-heavyweight-champ-klitschko-briggs-restaurant-melee/","title":"WATCH: Heavyweight champ Klitschko, contender Briggs in restaurant melee","date":"Aug 2, 2014 4:24 PM PHT","snippet":"The list of things Shannon Briggs will not do to get a shot at heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko is growing smaller by the day","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Check, please! Former heavyweight champ Shannon Briggs has made it very clear that he wants a shot at undisputed champion Wladimir Klitschko and isn’t ashamed to cross the threshold of poor taste to get it. A video posted by boxing website FightNews on Friday, August 1 shows the 42-year-old contender Briggs tracking down the Ukrainian-born Klitschko to Mamma Mia’s Italian restaurant in Hollywood, Fla. The uninvited guest proceeded to grab a fork and eat Klitschko’s food from his plate. The insulted champion kept his cool however, asking Briggs if he would like some water, pouring a glass of water from a bottle on the table and dumping it on Briggs’ head. Briggs then takes the stunt one step further, knocking all the contents off the table before being restrained and physically ejected from the restaurant. The website reports that Briggs was cut by broken glass and had to receive stitches.  Klitschko (62-3, 52 knockouts) is in South Florida preparing for a September 6 showdown with unbeaten contender Kubrat Pulev (20-0, 11 KOs) at the O2 World Arena in Hamburg, Germany. The fight will be the 17th defense of the title he has held since 2006. Briggs (55-6-1, 48 KOs), a New York native who now lives in South Florida, had brief title reigns in 1997 and 2006 and has defeated four unheralded opponents in 2014 since returning from a four-year absence after losing a one-sided bout to Wladimir’s older brother Vitali Klitschko in 2010. This incident comes on the heels of another confrontation between the two earlier this week when Briggs tracked Klitschko down at a gym and attempted to intimidate the 1996 Olympic gold medalist before being restrained by Klitschko’s trainers, former heavyweight champion Michael Moorer and one-time contender Johnathan Banks.   Not exactly in good taste but Briggs is probably happy that the masses are talking about him again. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/45536-kuala-lumpur-ten-places/","title":"10 places to see in Kuala Lumpur","date":"Dec 14, 2013 9:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Planning a trip this Christmas? Why not try Kuala Lumpur? Here are places to see.","body":" KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – Kuala Lumpur (KL) is a city of rapid socio-economic and cultural development. It serves as an iconic symbol of Malaysia’s future as well as the future of the region. It boasts of 8.9 million tourists a year, making it among the most visited cities in the world. The city is a cultural mixing pot of Malaysia’s 3 races – Malays, Chinese, Indians. It’s very Southeast Asian because of its service-driven economy, and yet it’s very Western because of its developed infrastructure. Last November, I visited KL with my family, staying with our relatives based there. Here are 10 places in KL that I recommend especially when traveling with your family. Culture, history, religion  Located near KL Sentral Station, Little India (Brickfields) serves as a center to the Indian population of the city. It is also a famous destination for tourists who want to explore Indian culture and tradition. We visited Little India 2 days before the Deepavali Festival (Festival of Lights) so we were able to witness the festive spirit of the Hindus – shops were on sale, lively Indian music was playing, and fireworks were sold on the streets. For those who want to buy Indian clothing and try authentic Indian cuisine, Little India is the place to go to. Visiting the place transports you from the bustling center of Malaysia to one of the streets of India. It’s as if you visited another country!  Another Indian heritage site in KL, Batu Caves (Rock Caves in English) is the most famous Hindu temple in Malaysia and is dedicated to the Lord Murugan. Indians frequently go here to practice Hindu religious rites. At the base of the mountain is a temple where tourists can enter to get their blessings from Hindu priests. There are 3 shrines inside, one for each of the 3 prime gods of Hinduism – Brahman, Vishnu and Shiva. After going through the temple below, you can go up 276 steps to get to the Temple Cave on top of the mountain. The cave walls are filled with different Hindu shrines that tell stories of Hindu gods. There are no fees to enter any of the temples but donations are accepted in the shrines.  A word of caution: Be careful with the monkeys. They tend to grab food items from guests. My mom and I were victims to this.  Merdeka Square is famous as a historical and recreational park in KL. It is in this place where the Malayan flag was first hoisted in 1957. The wide and green field beside the square makes it a good picnic spot and a spacious playground for kids. The vicinity of the square is also home to many historical buildings in KL that tourists can visit. Among these are the Old KL Train Station, Galeri Kuala Lumpur, Royal Selangor Club Complex, and the Sultan Abdul Samad Building. I recommend going to Merdeka at night. The well-lit vicinity and the cool night breeze makes it a good place to rest and relax after a busy day going around KL.  Malacca is not inside KL but is nearby. It is actually the 3rd smallest state of Malaysia, located 150 km southeast of KL. It is also known as “The Historic State” because of its rich cultural and historical heritage. During the time of their colonization of Malacca, the Portuguese and the Dutch made the city their port because of its geographic location. This is why there are many European-like infrastructure – old churches, forts and houses– that can be found there. Among the famous attractions in Malacca are the river cruise, which costs around MYR 15 for tourists, Fort A Famosa, and the Malacca Tower, which gives tourists a 360 degree panoramic view of the entire city for MYR 20. We got to Malacca by private car so I’m not sure how to get there by public transportation. I heard you can go to Malacca from KL for a day trip by bus. The price range is from MYR 13 to MYR 15. Skyscrapers A visit to KL is incomplete if you do not go to the towering skyscrapers in the city. I recommend these two because of their iconic significance and the majestic view that they offer.  Standing at 421 meters above the ground, Menara KL is the 7th tallest telecommunication tower in the world and the tallest one in Southeast Asia. The tower is mainly used for communication and broadcasting purposes but it has also become a tourist attraction for its height. Tourists can pay MYR 30 to go up to the observation deck (276 meters) for a 360-degree view of the city. Souvenir shops are also located on the observation deck. Above the observation deck is a rotating restaurant which serves fine dining meals and drinks. The other attractions in Menara KL are the traditional Malay village, the Blue Coral Aquarium, and the Formula 1 shop, all located at the base of the tower.  The Petronas Twin Towers is, perhaps, the most iconic building in Malaysia. It held the record of being the world’s tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004, until Taipei 101 was built. (Read: 9 places to visit in Taipei) At the base of the building is the KLCC mall and park, which are famous shopping and recreation centers in the city, respectively. Those who want to go up the towers can go to the skybridge (558 ft above the ground) that connects the 2 towers or the observation deck (360 meters above). It is not easy to get a ticket since they are limited to 1,000 people per day. You’ll have to line up at the earliest possible time to get a slot. Plus, you have to pay around MYR 80. Don’t worry though if you were not able to go up the towers. You can always shop in the KLCC mall! Shopping Speaking of shopping, your vacation to Kuala Lumpur won’t be complete without it. After all, KL like Bangkok, Taipei, and Seoul are highly regarded as shopping capitals in the region. Aside from Little India and KLCC, here are other famous and cheap places to shop in KL.  Chinatown KL, found at Petaling Jaya street, is a famous shopping place for tourists and locals alike. Everything can be found here – from keychains to clothes to bags. The best part about Chinatown is that you can haggle with the storekeepers. With the right skills, you can get something for half the original price that it was offered. If shopping here made you tired, you can always go to one of the tea shops in the area offering exquisite Chinese tea.  A  few meters away from Chinatown and you can see the Sentral Market. This is another famous shopping place for tourists. This is also where you buy traditional Malaysian batik and other Malaysian artifacts. Chocolates are also sold cheapest here compared to all the places I’ve visited in KL. We actually bought 5 kilos worth of chocolates in here alone. Prices in the Sentral Market, as compared to those in Chinatown, are fixed. There is very little space for haggling but the quality of the products are much better.  For shoe lovers, this mall is a paradise! There are many shops inside that offer discounted prices for original shoes. You can choose from a wide variety of shoes here – from their local brands to imported ones. Aside from shoes, clothes are also sold cheaper here for the same quality. There are also many restaurants inside that offer food from different regions of the world.  Lastly, I recommend that tourists go to Bukit Bintang. The entire district is full of shopping malls that sell branded and high-end products. Much like Seoul’s Myeongdong district, this is the place to shop for original make-up, branded bags, and imported clothes. There are also a number of good restaurants in the district so you can take a break whenever you like. If you’re tired of going around the city and shopping, you can always go to Changkat Bukit Bintang. It’s a whole street of night bars and clubs where you can party and drink. Alcohol is expensive in Malaysia but partying in KL is something definitely worth trying. There are many more places to visit and things to do in KL that I wasn’t able to cover. For one, I wasn’t able to go Putrajaya or see the beautiful Muslim mosques in the city. Definitely, this city deserves a second visit.

Hold on. Do not lose hope,” said Karlos Trangia, spokesman of Barug Katawhan. Trangia said the survivors of Pablo are worried for the residents in the Visayas because they know how hard it is to start again from scratch with many of their relatives either dead or missing. “It will also be very difficult to start rebuilding your life if you are hungry. Like what we experienced during Pablo, trucks and planes keep coming in to bring in relief goods but these supplies fail to reach the affected communities most especially in the far-flung areas,” Trangia shared. Trangia added that while sacks of rice form huge walls inside government warehouses, some would turn out to be unfit for consumption. “The survivors of Typhoon Yolanda must also prepare that they will encounter relief goods that are spoiled,” Trangia said. He said that the first few days will be chaotic but the residents themselves should create order and not solely rely on the government. Organized survival Barug Katawhan led the organization of affected communities in Mindanao after Pablo struck the area last December. Trangia recalled that Barug Katawhan was able to create various committees in the sub-villages and villages that were tasked to address specific concerns of the residents, including food and medicine. Barug Katawhan also began a series of massive protests – including a 10-hour occupation of a major highway in Montevista town – after the relief goods failed to reach their communities weeks after the disaster. “That protest was a success after Secretary Dinky Soliman herself faced us and committed to deliver 10,000 sacks of rice,” Trangia said. Last February, Barug Katawhan occupied and raided the regional office of the Department of Social Welfare and Development in Davao City over the alleged continuing poor delivery of aid in the communities. “It was not looting. We are only taking what is ours. We need food. There is available food but these are all locked up in the warehouse. It is very painful for us that time knowing that food, only a few meters from the area we were occupying, is not being distributed to the hungry,” Trangia said. Trangia also urged the public and the media to stop from tagging the survivors of Yolanda as looters. “I know how they feel. And it hurts that they are being called looters. They are not looters. They only wanted to survive. They want to feed their children,” Trangia said. Trangia commented that after a disaster, it is an instinct to grab what you can, including food, water and items – just to survive. “But the residents must organize themselves. They must act in an organized manner and that everything that they get must be divided according to the needs of their communities,” Trangia said. “They must conduct meetings and consultations among themselves. From these meetings, they can create plans on how to slowly rebuild their lives and formally pressure the government to step up the relief services,” he added. Lessons from Pablo Despite the problems, Barug Katawhan and DSWD were able to create a partnership particularly in helping each other in assessing and addressing the needs of the communities. “Many died inside the evacuation centers. Imagine the walls and the roof of these evacuation centers crushing those who are taking shelter in it. Imagine water, mud and debris swallowing these evacuation centers,” Trangia said. “It happened during Pablo. Now it happened again in Yolanda. And we thought that the administration of Aquino has learned that they must ensure that these evacuation centers are really safe for the residents,” added Trangia. He commented that if the government is unsure about the safety of these evacuation centers then the people must not be given false hope that these structures will protect them. “Second, even after Sendong, Pablo and the earthquake in Bohol, the government is still lame in providing quick response and relief for the survivors. The first few days after the storm are very critical. Many will possibly get sick or die because of the lack of food, medicine and water,” Trangia said. Trangia said Barug Katawhan helped in raising at least P15 million worth of relief goods for those who were devastated by Typhoon Yolanda. This will be personally delivered by Balsa Mindanao in Leyte and Samar. Balsa Mindanao is a multi-sectoral group composed of health groups, militant organizations and non-governmental organizations launched during Typhoon Sendong. “We know that this will be very hard for the people of Visayas. But we are confident that they will be able to spring back to their feet. We are not just resilient. We are brave and sharp-witted. Do not be afraid to organize and speak out and criticize. Demand from the government but at the same time create efforts in your communities that will help your families,” Trangia said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/43601-therapists-help-dazed-survivors/","title":"Therapists help dazed survivors","date":"Nov 13, 2013 1:41 PM PHT","snippet":"Survivors' reaction is 'normal in light of the abnormal situation,' says a psychologist","body":" TACLOBAN CITY, Philippines – Dozens of psychologists were starting work in the typhoon-raked Philippines Wednesday to help dazed survivors deal with the psychological fallout of one of the country’s worst ever disasters. The operation is an early attempt by health professionals to head off what they fear could be serious problems down the road, even as the physical scars from the tragedy begin to heal. There have been sporadic incidents of riots and looting, including the storming of a rice warehouse that left 8 people dead, and experts warn these could spiral if the root causes – loss and helplessness – are not addressed. “We are worried that in the next few days there will be anarchy,” said Annabelle de Veyra, chief administrator of the health department for the region. “Two big stores have already been looted. It’s not just food that they are getting. It’s more of a psychological reaction,” she told AFP. “People from Tacloban are not like that. They need psychological counselling,” she added. (READ: Survivors flee Tacloban) A 55-member team of psychologists from the health department arrived in Tacloban on Tuesday to help some of the city’s 220,000 inhabitants deal with the disaster, which is feared to have cost as many as 10,000 lives. Normal in an abnormal situation Stories of almost unimaginable tragedy abound in Tacloban, a place where parents have been forced to abandon the bodies of their children as they struggle to hold on to their own shattered lives. Those who have the strength are trying to flee the stench of death that hangs in the city; others wander its broken streets, dazed by the magnitude of the horror they have confronted. Nedy Tayag, a clinical psychologist for the health department, told AFP that behavior being exhibited by the typhoon survivors was typical among those confronted by massive disasters or destructive conflict. “Their reaction is normal in light of the abnormal situation,” the doctor said. Tayag, who worked with survivors of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami as well as victims of other earthquakes and conflicts in the region, said Typhoon Haiyan was by far the worst disaster she had been involved with, and it was imperative that issues be addressed early. “It could lead to mental breakdown, emotional imbalance, confusion and depression,” she said.The focus of the health department experts would be “psychological intervention” that could involve therapy and counselling sessions of both individuals and groups. De Veyra, the regional health official, said many of the survivors will need stress debriefing to combat their psychological reaction to the sight of water after the coastal city was flattened by deadly storm surges. She said the mental trauma of an event of this magnitude affected everyday behavior and decision-making. “Here people are walking to and fro, dazed. If there is a queue they automatically line up for it,” she said. Looters were not only grabbing food, but also big appliances like refrigerators and washing machines, she said. “They are hoarding everything. These are psychological effects,” said de Veyra, a trained nurse whose experience as a disaster responder included working with the victims of Typhoon Nargis in Myanmar which killed 138,000 people in 2008. Tayag said Tacloban looters were reacting to having lost everything to nature’s wrath and the helplessness they felt. “There is a justification: ‘I do not have anything but now I have the means to acquire them.’ It’s all about knowing that they are in control – they call the shots,” she said. – Rappler.com"}]}
