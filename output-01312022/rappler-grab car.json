The result compared with a profit of 1.17 trillion yen in the same period a year earlier, when SoftBank booked what was at the time a record quarterly result as its portfolio rallied. After tech unicorns plunged into the “valley of the coronavirus” in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son rode a recovery in valuations as startups such as e-commerce firm Coupang came to market. Now valuations are again under pressure as investors cast a skeptical eye over tech firms promising future profits and central banks move towards paring pandemic stimulus. The Vision Fund unit posted an investment gain of 111.45 billion yen during the quarter. Many portfolio companies are trading below their listing price, with office-sharing firm WeWork, ridehailer Grab and used-car platform Auto1 all falling during the quarter. The group’s exposure to China has also affected performance, as regulators take action against tech firms. Shares of e-commerce giant Alibaba, in which SoftBank has a stake, dropped a fifth in the three months to the end of December. Such assets are used by the group for loans as it invests through its Vision Fund unit, which runs the $100 billion Vision Fund and a smaller second fund. Vision Fund 2, which had $51 billion in committed capital at Dec-end, has invested $43.1 billion in more than 200 startups. SoftBank said separately on Tuesday its deal to sell chip designer Arm to Nvidia had fallen through amid regulatory hurdles. The earnings come at a watershed moment for the conglomerate as senior executives exit the firm, including Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, who led the restructuring of WeWork and launched the group’s Latin American-focused fund. Son, who three months ago said SoftBank was in a “blizzard”, will speak at a news conference at 4:30 pm local time (0730 GMT)."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/grab-bayanihan-cheaper-rides-vaccination-centers/","title":"Grab launches cheaper rides to COVID-19 vaccination centers","date":"Jun 29, 2021 2:44 PM PHT","snippet":"The rides will also be driven by vaccinated drivers. There will be about 1,000 drivers in the new service","body":"Grab Philippines on Tuesday, June 29, announced the launch of a new service that would make it cheaper to book rides going to vaccination centers.  Called GrabCar Bayanihan, the service will be cheaper than the regular GrabCar 2-seater service, although specific rates were not mentioned.  There will be two types of Bayanihan: “GrabCar Bayanihan From” and “GrabCar Bayanihan To.” The former is what commuters will see on their app if they’re booking from the vaccination center to their desired destination. The latter is what commuters will see on the app when booking from their point of origin, going to the vaccination center. GrabCar Bayanihan rides are driven by vaccinated drivers, lessening the risk that a passenger will be infected by COVID-19 on the way to getting vaccinated.  To book the service, type the vaccination center you’ve registered to. Grab says it usually starts with the word “Vaccine.” Once the location is confirmed, tap the GrabCar Bayanihan option. Grab has a full list of locations serviced by GrabCar Bayanihan here.  There will be about 1,000 vaccinated drivers on the service, plying Manila, Las Pinas, Taguig, Pasig, Makati, Quezon City, Pateros, and Marikina.  Grab also said it plans to add more locations for the service. The program is part of Grab Philippines’ broader GrabBayanihan Vaccination Support Program. In July 2020, Grab also had a “GrabBayanihan Car” initiative, which offered subsidized rates for frontline healthcare workers.  “As we all work towards a safe and gradual recovery for our communities, Grab will continue to leverage its platform and technology to ensure that our kababayans have the means to get inoculated,” said Grab Philippines country head Grace Vera Cruz. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-cashless-payments-feature/","title":"Grab shifts to cashless payments with new feature","date":"Oct 28, 2020 2:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines is also open to venturing into the motorcycle taxi business again 'if given a chance'","body":"Grab Philippines on Wednesday, October 28, announced that it has started rolling out a new feature to strengthen its adoption of cashless payments. The new app update – which would be rolled out to some users starting Wednesday – includes the Cash-in with Driver feature which essentially allows sedan-service passengers to top up credits with the drivers. Previously, users could only top up with select drivers. Now, the update will fully integrate the feature into the platform. All users will have the update by mid-November, according to Grab. The move is seen to minimize cash transactions – a requirement set by transport regulators given the pandemic. Under the initial run, users will be able to top up with their drivers in the following services: Grab Philippines head of transport and shared services Ronald Roda said the feature will be expanded to other services in the coming months. Users who have yet to set up the ride-hailing firm’s virtual wallet GrabPay will be asked to do so. The national government’s coronavirus task force recently allowed motorcycle taxis to resume operations, pending guidelines from transport agencies. Asked whether Grab would consider venturing into the service again, Roda answered that they could “if given a chance.” “I think it would be easy [to return]. We have 70,000 two-wheel drivers which would make it easy for us to convert if needed,” he added. In mid-2016, Grab used to offer motorcycle hailing services, but this was discontinued as the antiquated law banned two-wheelers from being hired. In 2019, Angkas motorcycle drivers were allowed to offer rides under the Department of Transportation-led pilot study.  The test run was extended to accommodate other players JoyRide and MoveIt, but it had to be cut a few days short because of the lockdown. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/outrage-over-reports-federal-agents-arresting-portland-protesters/","title":"Outrage over reports of federal agents arresting Portland protesters","date":"Jul 18, 2020 9:18 AM PHT","snippet":"According to interviews conducted by Oregon Public Broadcasting, federal law enforcement officers are driving around downtown Portland and detaining protesters with no explanation since at least July 14.","body":"Rights activists and lawmakers expressed outrage on Friday, July 17, over reports that federal agents circulating in unmarked cars in the western US state of Oregon were grabbing and detaining protesters off the streets. “What is happening now in Portland should concern everyone in the United States,” said Jann Carson, interim executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Oregon. “Usually when we see people in unmarked cars forcibly grab someone off the street, we call it kidnapping. “The actions of the militarized federal officers are flat-out unconstitutional and will not go unanswered,” he added. According to interviews conducted by Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB), federal law enforcement officers have been driving around downtown Portland and detaining protesters with no explanation since at least July 14. Mark Pettibone, a 29-year-old demonstrator, recalled being terrified when an unmarked minivan pulled up next to him early Wednesday and men with green military fatigues jumped out and detained him. “It seemed like it was out of a horror/sci-fi, like a Philip K. Dick novel,” Pettibone told The Washington Post. “It was like being preyed upon.” Pettibone said he was taken to the federal courthouse and later released without being told why he had been detained, or whether he had been charged with a crime. In a statement on Friday, US Customs and Border Protection said its agents were behind the arrest carried out as they “had information indicating the person in the video was suspected of assaults against federal agents or destruction of federal property.” “Once CBP agents approached the suspect, a large and violent mob moved towards their location,” the agency said in a statement sent to AFP. “For everyone’s safety, CBP agents quickly moved the suspect to a safer location for further questioning. “The CBP agents identified themselves and were wearing CBP insignia during the encounter,” the statement added. “The names of the agents were not displayed due to recent doxing incidents against law enforcement personnel who serve and protect our country.” Federal officers have been deployed in Portland as part of President Donald Trump’s plan to crush nightly protests outside the city’s federal courthouse and another court building. The protests against racism and police brutality were sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and have taken place across the country for more than six weeks.  “A peaceful protester in Portland was shot in the head by one of Donald Trump’s secret police,” Senator Ron Wyden wrote in a tweet on Thursday that also denounced Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security who visited Portland the same day. “Now Trump and Chad Wolf are weaponizing the DHS as their own occupying army to provoke violence on the streets of my hometown because they think it plays well with right-wing media,” Wyden said. The governor of the state, Kate Brown, also hit out at the Trump administration. “This political theater from President Trump has nothing to do with public safety,” she wrote in a tweet. “The President is failing to lead this nation. Now he is deploying federal officers to patrol the streets of Portland in a blatant abuse of power by the federal government.”  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/260650-explainer-what-is-modified-ecq-gcq/","title":"EXPLAINER: What’s modified ECQ and modified GCQ?","date":"May 12, 2020 2:02 PM PHT","snippet":"(2nd UPDATE) The changes to the country's strictest form of quarantine allows more industries to resume operations while giving local governments the power to declare hard lockdowns in barangays with COVID-19 cases","body":" MANILA, Philippines (2nd UPDATE) – The Philippine government has introduced a new form of quarantine to save economies of urban hubs with high numbers of coronavirus cases. This is the “modified enhanced community quarantine” that will be enforced in Metro Manila, Laguna, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Zambales, Angeles City from May 16 to 31.  This term was introduced by Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque in a press briefing on Tuesday, May 12.  He also introduced the term “modified general community quarantine,” the lowest form of quarantine, which will be observed in “low-risk” provinces and cities. So far, no area is under MGCQ. Despite the label, it doesn’t entail any strict stay-at-home measures. But it does require the continuance of health guidelines like mask-wearing, physical distancing, and frequent handwashing. Here’s what we know so far about these terms. (For full copy of the Omnibus Guidelines on ECQ, MECQ, GCQ, MGCQ, go here.) Who can go out? Exercising outdoors, like jogging and biking, are now allowed if people wear masks and stay two meters apart. What kind of industries can operate? Media establishments, producers of cement and steel, BPO and export-oriented establishments that can operate off-site, mining and quarrying, e-commerce, postal ande delivery services, rental and leasing of vehicles and equipment for permitted sectors, recruitment for permitted sectors, repair of computers, personal and household goods, and housing services can operate at full capacity. Certain other industries and establishments can operate at 50% capacity, like beverage makers, real estate, advertising, film and music production, clothing stores, bookstores, baby supplies, flowers and jewelry shops.

The NPC said in a statement on Tuesday, February 5, that it “has issued a Cease and Desist Order (CDO) to Grab Philippines, Inc. (Grab PH) after finding deficiencies in complying with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (DPA) for three personal data processing systems, which may endanger the privacy rights of the riding public.” The systems: Grab earlier installed passenger verification via selfie as a security measure. If a passenger is unable to take a selfie, their identity may be verified by adding a credit/debit card. On January 13, Grab rolled out in-car audio and video recording as a measure to assist in incident prevention and dispute resolution. The pilot program was meant to run for 2 to 6 weeks with over 180 GrabCar vehicles, half of which are equipped with in-car cameras and half with audio-recording systems. According to Grab, passengers who booked cars involved in this pilot test would be notified in advance through GrabChat, and could opt to cancel the booking without penalty. The audio and video recordings would be encrypted and stored in Grab’s database for 7 days and 10 hours, respectively, only accessible by authorized Grab representatives in the event of an incident needing investigation.   Early reactions: On January 12, Grab user Ana Sanchez posted on Facebook that the GrabCar she was riding was equipped with audio recording, even without her explicit consent. She only noticed the sign 5 minutes into the ride.  “I did not stop the car midway, I just kept [quiet], in general, throughout the ride because I was uncomfortable at the thought of being recorded,” she told Rappler. {source} <iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmirensanchez%2Fposts%2F10158085234801204&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”669″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true” allow=”encrypted-media”></iframe> {/source} Sanchez reported her experience to the NPC for further investigation. According to Grab, no recording happened in this case since the pilot program started on January 13, and that the driver made the mistake of putting up the notice ahead of the pilot.  On January 14, the NPC announced that it had called on Grab to address the privacy concerns relating to the launch of their in-car audio and video recording systems. It issued a Notice of Deficiencies to Grab on January 31 after it “found several deficiencies” in the 3 systems. The deficiencies:  The NPC said on Wednesday that Grab “did not sufficiently identify and assess the risks posed by these systems on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.” “Only the risks faced by the company were taken into account” in its Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), the NPC said. The NPC notice also said that “the video recording system will also enable Grab employees to monitor the situation live from the Grab Office and take photos of what is happening inside the vehicle, once the driver prompts the office through an emergency button.” The NPC noted that the public was not informed about the collection and release mechanisms of the 3 systems – that these would be released upon request to police authorities in the event of a dispute, conflict, or complaint – through Grab’s privacy notice and privacy policy. The NPC noted that Grab “also failed to mention its legal basis in processing the collected data.” “The documents submitted to the NPC were also found to be insufficient to establish whether the company’s data processing was proportional to its intended purpose; whether the benefits of the processing outweigh the risks involved; nor whether the processing was the best among considered alternatives to achieve the underlying purpose,” it said. Moreover, the NPC found that the option to withdraw consent was not sufficiently communicated to passengers through GrabChat. “It was also unclear if and hor data processing will be affected upon such withdrawal of consent,” the NPC added. What happens next: Grab is required to comply with remedial measures within 15 days, as directed by the NPC. The suspension of the systems would be in place until the company addresses the deficiencies. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/237491-bela-padilla-calls-out-grab-philippines-reveals-home-address/","title":"‘This can’t be right’: Bela Padilla calls out Grab driver for revealing home address","date":"Aug 10, 2019 5:27 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines apologizes, and tells the actress it will investigate the matter","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Actress Bela Padilla took to Twitter on Saturday, August 10, to air her disappointment over an apparent breach of Grab Philippines’ customer privacy policy during her ride on Friday, August 9.

Grab deactivated some 8,000 drivers without a certificate of public convenience (CPC), which was a requirement of the LTFRB. In a press briefing on Monday, June 10, drivers enumerated the following processes which make securing the requirements to get a CPC difficult: CPC hearing process – Drivers said Transport Netwrork Vehicle Service (TNVS) operators can only be represented by either the spouse, parents, or descendants. They said this requirement affected many operators leading to dismissals and resultingr in monetary losses. “TNVS operators affected mostly are those who work abroad, doing part time for TNVS, or not based in Metro Manila,” their statement read. Drivers appealed to the agencies to allow them to issue a special power of attorney to any person they want to represent them. Bank conformity – This document is secured from banks and allow the units to be used for public transportation. “Different banks have their own processes and fees in securing this certificate,” the drivers said. Moreover, they said that this requirement was only good for companies with a fleet of cars. In the case of TNVS, most only have one car or two. “Many operators cannot comply, some banks will ask for thousands of pesos in fees, plus an increase of monthly amortization,” the drivers said. Instead of a bank conformity, they proposed getting a commercial insurance of their choice to still protect the interest of the banks. Proof of financial capability – The LTFRB increased this requirement 233% to P50,000, from P15,000. Drivers said this is hard for many small entrepreneurs.  “Many have no savings of P50,000, and it is only now that they are able to save…. We pray for the board to recompute the amount that is fair for small businesses,” the statement read. Due to the problems cited, many TNVS operators supposedly gave up and had their cars surrendered to banks.

This figure is nearly one-fifth of around 45,000 active Grab drivers, which means Filipinos can expect longer waiting time for bookings and price surges due to limited supply. Grab said on Monday, June 3, that it will be deactivating TNVS partners who have not yet submitted any proof that they were granted provisional authority by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The company said it acted in good faith that TNVS partners would comply with the requirements set by the LTFRB. “This will reduce the number of vehicles servicing our commuting public, thus inconveniencing many Filipinos,” Grab Philippines president Brian Cu admitted. Cu hopes the inconvenience will be temporary, as Grab anticipates new drivers by June 10, where some 10,000 slots for application will be opened. On top of that figure, the LTFRB in December opened 20,000 slots. Cu said the deactivated drivers can still apply for a slot. “At the end of the day, many Filipinos will suffer from this painful step – both the drivers and the passengers.

Singapore-headquartered Grab agreed to buy US firm Uber’s ride-hailing and food business in Southeast Asia in March, ending a bruising battle between the companies. In return, Uber received a 27.5% stake in Grab. However the deal came under scrutiny across the region, and the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore was among watchdogs in several countries that launched probes. In the conclusion to its investigation, the commission said it had found the merger had substantially reduced “competition in the ride-hailing platform market in Singapore.” Grab fares rose between 10% and 15% after the deal as the company reduced the number of points earned by riders and made it harder for them to redeem them, it said. Potential competitors were hampered by exclusivity agreements Grab forged with taxi companies, car rental partners, and some of its drivers, the commission said. The deals meant drivers could not work for other companies. The commission fined both firms a total Sg$13 million ($9.5 million) – Sg$6.42 million for Grab and Sg$6.58 million for Uber – “to deter completed, irreversible mergers that harm competition.” The body also criticized Grab and Uber for not getting the commission’s clearance before completing the deal. In addition to the fines, the commission ordered several measures be implemented to ease fares and allow new players to compete with Grab, including reverting to pre-merger pricing and allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing platforms. Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore, said the firm completed the deal “within its legal rights, and still maintains we did not intentionally or negligently breach competition laws.” In the Philippines, the competition watchdog last month approved the merger but imposed conditions related to areas including pricing and exclusivity arrangements to prevent Grab acting like a monopoly. Malaysian authorities are also examining the deal. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/209279-grab-fares-status-after-philippine-competition-commission-conditions/","title":"Grab fares ‘not necessarily lower’ after Uber buyout approval","date":"Aug 10, 2018 5:09 PM PHT","snippet":"In fact, Grab has a 5% fare hike petition pending with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines said that fares “will not necessarily be lower” following the fair price and quality service conditions imposed by the Philippine Competition Commision (PCC). In a media briefing after the PCC approved the Grab-Uber buyout, lawyer Miguel Aguila said the fares of the ride-hailing company would still be within a set range. “What we are committed to is not to increase our fares by 22% more than what it was last year. So the fare structure can change the minimum and maximum fares… but we will [just] have to stay at a certain range,” Aguila said on Friday, August 10. This means that fares, for example, that range around P170 last year cannot be more than P200 following the PCC conditions, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said. In January, the ride-hailing giant applied for a 5% fare hike at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Aguila said that Grab’s pricing scheme will rely on what the LTFRB will allow. On Friday, the PCC approved the regional acquisition deal between ride-hailing giants Grab and Uber, but imposed conditions that Grab has to follow until there is “sufficient competition” in the market. To meet antitrust commitments, Cu said that they have lowered their surge rates to 1.8 times the regular fare. “The average price will still stay within range. Our way to increase revenue of our partners is not to increase in prices [but] it’s providing more rides by adding more vehicles on the roads,” Cu said. Challenges: Cu noted that improving the allocation rate of drivers to passengers will continue to  be a challenge, given the LTFRB’s franchise cap at 65,000 units. “To achieve levels in which service quality goes back up to 70% allocation rate – that the LTFRB said is their basis of ‘maximum supply’ – would still be tough if we cannot add more cars,” Cu said. Grab earlier said that there are only around 35,000 drivers that serve 600,000 bookings per day. This, they said, affects the booking acceptance for passengers as “demand exceeds supply.” To address this, Cu called on the LTFRB to reimpose their P2-per-minute travel duration charge that was suspended by the regulatory board, or to allow them to accept new drivers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/205153-diego-loyzaga-statement-grab-driver-accusation/","title":"Diego Loyzaga denies attacking Grab Car vehicle while drunk","date":"Jun 17, 2018 10:20 PM PHT","snippet":"A Grab Car driver accuses actor Diego Loyzaga of attacking and kicking his vehicle while drunk","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Actor Diego Loyzaga denied attacking and hitting a vehicle while drunk, and claimed that the Grab Car driver who accused him of this was lying. Diego now faces a formal complaint over the alleged incident.   But in an interview on TV Patrol that aired on Saturday, June 16, Diego, son of actors Cesar Montano and Teresa Loyzaga, said Grab Car driver John Ronnel Paglalunan lied. Diego said he was not drunk and he did not attack either the driver or the vehicle along in Manila on Friday, June 15.  The Pusong Ligaw actor had apparently been asleep in his vehicle when it made an abrupt turn because John Ronnel allegedly almost hit his convoy. The Grab Car driver, meanwhile, claimed Diego’s convoy made the abrupt actions and even beat the red light.  Diego said he went down his vehicle and attempted to speak to the driver. “I tried to approach the driver and talk to him. I said peace to him and what did he do? He just put up his phone and started taking a video of me. Nabastos ako doon (I thought that was a rude thing to do),” he said.

The actor said no damage was done to the car or the Grab Car driver, but according to an earlier ABS-CBN report, the vehicle’s front bumper loosened as a result of Diego’s alleged attack.  Diego also lashed out at critics who have hit him over the issue.  “My past hasn’t been all that great. I’ve had troubles in my past. But just because someone screwed up in the past, it doesn’t make them the bad person forever,” he said.  Diego’s camp has since gotten in touch with the owner of the vehicle, who has apparently expressed willingness to retract the allegations if proven that it was John Ronnel who caused the incident.  Teresa Loyzaga has also accused the Grab Car driver of making up stories and of almost causing an accident. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/204800-toyota-investment-ride-hailing-company-grab-asia/","title":"Toyota investing $1 billion in Grab","date":"Jun 13, 2018 10:50 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The Japanese automaker plans to expand beyond its core business into the 'mobility' sector","body":" TOKYO, Japan (UPDATED) – Toyota said Wednesday, June 13, it was investing $1 billion in Asia ride-share company Grab, as the Japanese automaker looks to expand beyond its core business into the “mobility” sector. Grab, which is headquartered in Singapore, is a leading player in the ride-share industry in Asia, and earlier this year agreed to acquire US giant Uber’s regional operations. In a statement, Toyota said the deal “is aimed at achieving connectivity for Grab’s rental car fleet across Southeast Asia, and at rolling out various connected services throughout the region that utilize vehicle data” stored by Toyota. Toyota will place one of its executives on Grab’s board, and a second Toyota team member will serve as an executive officer at the company, which Toyota called the “partner of choice for ride-hailing in the region.” The investment comes as Toyota works to adapt to what company president Akio Toyoda calls “profound change” in the industry. Last month, Toyoda pledged to transform the auto giant to meet a “once-in-a-century challenge.” “I have decided to transform Toyota from a car manufacturer to a mobility company,” he said, without offering much detail on what that would entail beyond providing “various services involving movement of people around the world.” Grab operates across Asia and agreed to acquire Uber’s Southeast Asian business earlier this year. The deal has run into trouble though, with Singapore saying in April that it would impose restrictions on the acquisition until it concludes a probe into whether the sale may have infringed competition rules.

With the exit of Uber from the Philippine ride-hailing market, many Filipino commuters were left with only Grab. But in April, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited 5 new ride-hailing companies that offer booking services for taxis, sedans, and other vehicle types. So who are the new players and what can they offer? And more importantly, how much will they charge?  New ride-hailing apps MiCab MiCab Systems Corporation is a taxi-hailing company which traces its roots to a startup ideation camp in Cebu City in 2012. It has been operating in the city since then. MiCab is a wordplay for Mobile Internet Cab, with the aim to modernize taxi operations. (WATCH: 6 questions with the founder of new Grab competitor, Micab) With its accreditation, MiCab looks at venturing into the Metro Manila market while maintaining operations in Cebu, Iloilo, and Davao. MiCab does not charge booking fees. Commuters only have to pay what is on the taxi meter. Under government-approved fares, taxis charge a P40 flagdown rate, with an additional P13.50 every 300 meters and P2 per minute travel. The company supports its operations through MiAds or advertisements placed inside its taxis. HirNa Like MiCab, HirNa Mobility Solutions Incorporated is another transport network company (TNC) that is focused on giving taxis a platform for bookings. HirNa chief executive officer Coco Mauricio earlier said they saw the “need to tap into an existing transportation mode such as taxis.” The company started in Davao City in 2017 as part of the city’s transportation master plan. HirNa is now looking at expanding to Metro Manila, Iligan City in Lanao del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental. The app has a 24/7 hotline service for bookings to cater to commuters who do not have smartphones. It also has a button within the app that directly connects to the hotline of the LTFRB, should there be problems with the ride. To place bookings, patrons don’t have to put their destination, unlike other ride-hailing apps. They can choose between a taxi sedan or a taxi AUV. HirNa doesn’t charge booking fees as well, with commuters paying only what is on the taxi meter. The LTFRB recently allowed all ride-hailing firms to charge P2/min travel. This means that Hirna may start charging per-minute rates starting September 21, if they decide to do so. Owto Owto is a TNC by Ipara Technologies and Solutions Incorporated, founded by former Grab and Uber drivers who wanted to make the ride-hailing industry a profitable one for drivers. Paulo Libertad, Owto’s chief operating officer, said they charge the smallest commission among other companies at 15%. The average commission charged is at 20% of driver’s earnings, not including incentives. Owto recently launched on May 18. Like Uber and Grab, it offers transport network vehicle services for sedans around Metro Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, and Cavite. It also has a pooling feature. It charges a fee of P50 if cancellations are done 3 minutes after the booking was made. Under its approved fares, Owto charges a base fare of P40, with an additional P12 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. They set a surge cap of times two the fare for the distance traveled and duration of the ride. Go Lag Go Laguna, or Go Lag for short, is a ride-hailing service looking at offering rides to Greater Metro Manila Area commuters, who are sometimes rejected by existing ride-hailing drivers because of the distance. Originally intended to serve the province of Laguna, Go Lag expanded its intended market to Metro Manila, Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan. Go Lag has yet to launch its app, but is currently accepting driver applications. It will be a ride-hailing platform for sedans. Go Lag will be charging a base fare of P40, on top of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. Surge pricing is capped at 1.5 times. Hype  Among the TNCs, Hype Transport Systems focuses on the security of both drivers and commuters. Though the app is not yet available for download, Hype will feature an “SOS” button in times of emergencies. Hype will offer different vehicle types for commuters ranging from taxis and sedans to AUVs and SUVs. It will also offer a ride-sharing service for sedans. The flagdown rate for each service depends on the vehicle type. Sedans will have a base of P40. For SUVs, it’s at P70, and for vans, P100. There will be an additional charge of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute, with a surge cap at times two the charge. Meanwhile, Hype’s ride-sharing service has a P30 flagdown rate on top of P9.50 per kilometer travel. Existing ride-hailing apps Grab Grab, through MyTaxi.PH, has been in the Philippine market since 2013, offering taxi-hailing services. In 2015, it launched its private vehicle booking service as well as more luxurious cars. Grab is available in Metro Manila and major cities around the Philippines. It recently got involved in a controversy involving its fares, when PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused it of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge was suspended in April. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) LTFRB said that Grab can now charge P2 per minute since it allowed all firms to do so, but the order will not affect its pending case before the regulatory board. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated TNCs’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40 for sedans, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. For a 6-seater vehicle, Grab charges a flagdown rate of P60, with P13 to P19 per kilometer. For premium cars, the base fare is at P70 on top of P16 to P23 per kilometer. Grab launched a 100-day campaign geared toward improving driver and passenger experience. It is looking at imposing cancellation fees as well. U-Hop U-Hop was granted a license to operate as a TNC by the LTFRB back in March 2016. Among TNCs, U-Hop is the only company that offers shuttle services to individuals and companies. When it launched in July 2016, U-Hop only offered shuttle services with a capacity of 7 passengers. It now offers the same services as Uber and Grab, which is to pre-arrange taxi, private car, and social carpooling rides. It is operational in Metro Manila, Cebu, and other major cities. But in February, U-Hop was suspended in Batangas, with the local government requiring documents necessary for operations. U-Hop charges P40 for sedans, P70 for SUVs, and P100 for vans, with an additional P14.75 to P15.75 per kilometer and P2 per minute of travel. For companies, they charge a monthly membership of P3,999 for 40 prioritized rides. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/195414-cordillera-gongs-san-francisco-california/","title":"Cordillera gongs stolen in California","date":"Feb 6, 2018 8:25 PM PHT","snippet":"The Oakland-based ACPA has been lending the gangsa to Filipino dance troupes in the area","body":" BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – Cordillera gongs or gangsas are so expensive that an ensemble of rare ones would cost a herd of carabaos.  Gangsas, forged largely from bronze, is handed down through generations of clans or families and brought out during prestige rites and other Cordillera rituals. Some of the older ones even have handles made of the human jaws, usually coming from the heads of enemies. The theft of the gangsa may not be enough reason for a tribal war but still, add to that the grief and tension of the village which had to contribute for a new set or face months of silence. And so it came to notice that in San Francisco, California, someone broke into the car of Major Julian, the manager of Parangal Dance Company, and stole the gangsa ensemble of the American Center of Philippine Arts. “They’re rare, expensive, and likely of no value to the thief,” wrote Scott Louie, in his Facebook wall. The Oakland-based ACPA has been lending the gangsa to Filipino dance troupes in the area. The lost gangsas have ACPA stickers on them. “Our gangsas were snatched out of one of our musician’s car while we were rehearsing,” said ACPA. “They smashed his car window and grabbed our bag of gangsas.” “These instruments are so valuable to us and are only made in the Philippines,” it added.

Starting last month, NCIP Cordillera partnered with Brotherhood of Reforming Orderly and Disciplined Detainee (BRODD) in the project which targets only those with Cordilleran blood. The materials, equipment, and training are furnished by NCIP Cordillera while the finished gangsas would be given to the detainees.

When Starkiller Base, the First Order’s headquarters, was destroyed in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it may have taken a toll on their resources but not at all on their strength and numbers. And they’re more than ready to launch yet another attack. The Resistance also have no choice but to fight back to save the galaxy’s freedom and democracy. Now that Luke Skywalker is back, he’s here to train Rey, the only chance that the Resistance has against the First Order, to prepare her for a face-off with one of the order’s leaders, Kylo Ren.

It’s composed of former Imperial military members and sympathizers who resided in unknown parts of the galaxy to carefully plan for their return to power. The Order is patterned after the fascist ideals of the Empire but taking only its strengths and eliminating its weaknesses. They have an alliance with Knights of Ren. Leaders: Supreme Leader Snoke, General Hux, Captain Phasma, Kylo Ren Members: Stormtroopers, Flametroopers, Snowtroopers Mission: Get their revenge against the Resistance for destroying the Starkiller Base and ultimately, take over the Republic as the Galactic Empire once did before it was overthrown by the government. The Resistance  Background: The Resistance, as the name suggests, is a military resistance movement that was formed to fight against the First Order. It was when the Galactic Senate didn’t see the Order as a threat to the Republic that General Leia organized this militant group. And when the First Order fired the Starkiller Base’s superweapon that destroyed the Hosnian System, it was the Resistance who launched a counterattack. The Galactic Senate is now their ally. Leaders: General Leia Organa, Admiral Statura, Admiral Ackbar, Major Brance, Major Ematt  Members: Poe Dameron, Rey, Finn, Doctor Kalonia, Snap Wexley, Jess Pava, Ello Asty, Nien Nunb, Vober Dand, Goss Toowers, Bollie Prindel, Kaydel Ko, Pamich Nerro, Korr Sella, C-3PO, R2-D2, BB-8 Mission: To save innocent lives and maintain peace, freedom, and democracy by preventing the First Order from overthrowing the government and claiming the Republic.

Hospital bills are estimated to cost up to P1 million.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Everything turned upside down for 23-year-old Alejandro Cajano on the night of July 15.  By habit, he took a motorcycle ride courtesy of ride-sharing app Angkas on his way home to Makati. That night, however, he figured in a tragic crash that left him in a coma for over 2 weeks now.  It happened near Nagtahan bridge, in the city of Manila, when the vehicle in front of them suddenly stopped, causing Cajano and the Angkas rider or biker to fall to the ground. Before they could recover from the impact of the fall, an SUV behind them hit Cajano.  Following the crash, Cajano sustained brain injuries and was left in a critical condition. Half a month after the incident, he has raked up a huge hospital bill estimated to reach up to P1.1 million. Convenient service Tragic incidents like this raise questions about how app-based transportation services are regulated. This was raised during the hearings by a lawmaker who lost his relative in a car crash in Singapore involving a similar transport-based app-service, Uber. (READ: Grieving lawmaker demands Grab, Uber legal accountability) In its January 2017 press release, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that Angkas is “considered as another form of TNC [Transport Network Company]”. Angkas is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a “software application provider, [that] matches users [with] third party service providers like passengers and bikers.”  Just like Grab and Uber, Angkas customers can easily book a ride through their app. Aside from being able to zoom through traffic, Angkas riders also offer cheaper fares. Angkas rides cost P50 for the first two kilometers and an additional P10 for the next kilometer.  Angkas essentially provides its customers with a convenient and cheap way to navigate through the city where mass transportation remains problematic and where traffic jams are a common occurrence. There is a need to clarify guidelines, however, when questions arise about who foots the bill when crashes happen.  In Cajano’s case, it was Angkas and the SUV driver, Louie Dy, who paid the bills at the Del los Santos Medical Center where Cajano was initially admitted. Cajano’s condition and mounting bills, however, required him to be moved to the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center, a publicly-owned hospital.  Because multiple parties are involved (the Angkas rider, Angkas itself, Cajano’s family, and the SUV driver), lawyers have stepped in to mediate the case and settle liabilities.   On July 30, two weeks after the incident, Angkas released an official statement on their Facebook page stating that they have provided financial assistance to both the rider and Cajano.   The family has been grateful to Angkas for its cooperation, especially in terms of financial support.  According to a GMA News report, however, the management of Angkas sent a statement to the Manila Traffic Enforcement Unit saying that the motorcycle rider, Zammy Banzuela, is not their employee.  Angkas described Banzuela as someone with the “access [to] the Angkas App’s booking services [which allowed] him to be matched with passengers who use the Angkas App.” Accountability issues Under LTFRB’s Memorandum Circular No. 2004-004, Public Utility Vehicles nationwide are required to have the Passenger Personal Accident Insurance Program (PPAI). In 2015, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) extended the same requirement to Transport Network Companies (TNCs) like Uber and Grab through Department Order No.  2015-011. Things are more complicated for Angkas, however, compared to the situation of other TNCs.  For one thing, existing transport regulations do not consider motorcycles and tricycles as PUVs. By extension, motorcycles are also not included in the type of vehicles operated by TNCs according to LTFRB guidelines.  Therefore, although the LTFRB considers Angkas a TNC, the agency has not accredited it and has even ordered it to stop operations in January 2017.     The issue becomes even more of a concern given that motorcycle riders are the most vulnerable groups to road traffic crashes in the Philippines according to data from the World Health Organization.   Riders may be sanctioned Because regulations are murky in this area, it is unclear what sanctions might be imposed on Angkas when crashes arise. The Land Transportation Office (LTO), which has jurisdiction over the registration of motorcycles, said that it can only impose sanctions on Angkas riders in the meantime, according to an Inquirer report. In its Facebook page, Angkas promises to ensure coverage for both the biker and passenger. This insurance policy covers up to P 200,000 according to an Angkas employee. Riders and passengers who figure in crashes can claim the insurance after 15 days of confinement with complete hospital documents.  To ensure the safety of both passengers and bikers, Angkas spokesperson Walter Wong said they make sure their bikers are professionals by conducting background checks and by making sure that motorcycles are in good condition. Angkas also said it requires biker applicants to pass through an obstacle course examination to ensure that they are well trained. Aside from this, they also conduct seminars and service training on how to handle passengers. When asked about this issue, Wong replied, “We want to provide a safe, accountable, and professional service to passengers whose needs are currently not being met. In the absence of a clear policy, habal-habal continues to proliferate but without any professionalization or safety measures in place.” He added, “So we welcome regulation of our industry to raise the standards for this type of service. When Grab and Uber started, car-hailing was also a new and unregulated industry that faced the same challenges as us. Today, it’s acknowledged that they provide a lot of value to commuters. We believe it’ll be the same for us.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/176536-grab-new-financing-didi-chuxing-softbank/","title":"Grab to raise $2.5B in new financing","date":"Jul 24, 2017 1:10 PM PHT","snippet":"The Singapore-based firm says it will use the fresh funds to bolster its leading position in the ride-hailing industry and invest in a mobile payment platform called GrabPay","body":" SINGAPORE – Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab said Monday, July 24, it expects to raise $2.5 billion in financing, mostly from China’s Didi Chuxing and Japan’s Softbank, as it strengthens its lead over rival Uber. Didi, China’s ride-hailing leader, and mobile giant SoftBank will invest up to $2.0 billion while $500 million is expected to come from other new and existing investors. Grab said it amounts to the largest single financing in Southeast Asia. Both Didi and SoftBank are already investors in Grab. The Singapore-based firm said it would use the fresh funds to bolster its leading position in the ride-hailing industry and invest in a mobile payment platform called GrabPay. “We are delighted to deepen our strategic partnership with Didi and SoftBank,” said Anthony Tan, Grab’s group chief executive and co-founder. “With their support, Grab will achieve an unassailable market lead in ridesharing, and build on this to make GrabPay the payment solution of choice for Southeast Asia.” Grab said it has a market share of 95% in third-party taxi-hailing and 71% in private-vehicle hailing in Southeast Asia, far ahead of main rival Uber. Grab offers private car, taxi, motorbike and carpooling services in seven countries and 65 cities across Southeast Asia, a region of 650 million people. “Starting with transport, Grab is establishing a clear leadership in Southeast Asia’s internet economy based on its market position, superior technology, and truly local insight,” said Didi founder and chief executive Cheng Wei in a statement. “Both companies look forward to working together with communities and policymakers across Asia to fully embrace the extraordinary opportunities in the upcoming transportation revolution.” Masayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive of SoftBank, described Grab as “a tremendously exciting company in a dynamic and promising region.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/175938-go-beyond-save-grab-uber/","title":"Let us go beyond #WeWantUberGrab","date":"Jul 18, 2017 1:50 PM PHT","snippet":"'What I support is a more comprehensive campaign that calls for better public transportation that benefits everyone – commuters and drivers alike'","body":"Here’s an unpopular opinion: I don’t exactly rally behind the #WeWantUberGrab campaign. What I support is a more comprehensive campaign calling for better public transportation that benefits everyone – commuters and drivers alike.  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has halted the apprehension of undocumented drivers until Wednesday, July 26, 2017. Responding to this, Grab and Uber drivers united and launched an online campaign calling on the LTFRB to grant permits to additional Uber and Grab drivers.  I, however, think that saving Grab and Uber alone will not really solve our traffic woes in Metro Manila.  Let me start by sharing my experience with a taxi driver – whose name unfortunately escaped my memory – almost two years ago. Unfair boundary system  He told me that taxi drivers like him work 24 hours a day just so they could reach their boundary and earn enough to support his family for two days.  “Paano ‘nyo nakakaya (How do you do it)?” I asked.  “’Ayun Ma’am, lumalaklak ako ng Cobra at kape. Minsan sinasamahan ko pa ng Red bull. Ganoon talaga eh,” he answered with a smile. (Ma’am, I drink Cobra and coffee. Sometimes, I would also take strong energy drinks like Red Bull. That’s just how it is.) He said he would spend the following day in bed, gathering his strength for the next cycle on the road. The next day, he would start work at 5 am, weathering the traffic, unforgivable flooding and rain, and fatigue, and clock out exactly 24 hours later. He said this as a matter fact, without the slightest hint of complaint or regret. That is how he is able to put food on the table. How could he complain about it? Since then, I’ve made it my mission to ask every taxi driver I get to meet if this is how they lived. Majority of the taxi drivers – from the youngest to the 72-year-old driver I met – affirmed this.  The only ones who control their time and sleeping habit are those who are rich enough to own a cab. And that’s just a speck of the total taxi driver population in the Philippines.  The plight of bus drivers and conductors who would cram their vehicles with standing passengers during rush hour is no different. They are also limited by the boundary system that defines our public transportation system. This is the reality of many taxi and bus drivers in the country: the public transportation system is plainly inhumane to them.  False dichotomy How does this relate to the “We want Uber and Grab” campaign?  The current narrative surrounding the campaign creates a false dichotomy between the ride-sharing apps and traditional public utility vehicles. It is as if to favor one thing, you should be against the other.  But that misses the whole point.  It is true that Grab and Uber have served as an answered prayer for many commuters in Metro Manila,  However, Grab and Uber alone cannot solve traffic. In fact, they only add more franchises and cars on the road, benefitting only a certain portion of the commuter population that could afford its pricing rate on a daily basis. And how they leave more carbon footprint is a totally different matter.  What the country needs is better public transportation which essentially means fewer and more efficient modes of transportation – emphasis on train systems and buses – that have the capacity to transport more commuters.  Because of the false dichotomy, we forget that there are good and bad drivers regardless if they drive a cab or a Grab or Uber car. We’ve read it on social media, in news reports.  There are kind and honorable taxi drivers like Gener Jarito and Jhun Ochavo as there are rude drivers with the Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS).   Because of the false dichotomy, we also miss the fact the LTFRB is not only being inconsistent with its regulation of franchises. It has also failed to fix the boundary system in taxis and buses, and has fallen short in delivering its mandate to provide a decent means of livelihood for regular public utility vehicle drivers.  What is clear and sure is that it is wrong for the government to cut the lifeline of a temporary and functional solution such as Grab and Uber without providing a long-term solution to traffic for the public.  Proposal What should the government do then?  We are on the cusp of technological disruptions. Airbnb has redefined accommodation. Social media has empowered citizen journalism. Amazon has taken the retail industry on a whole new level. As early as now, we should be asking ourselves: In this age of technological disruptions, how do we make sure everybody gains from them? Right now, with the discussion on public transportation in the Philippines, the onus largely weighs on the government to make sure this gets addressed.  This is why I agree with Grab when it said that “we must level it up by improving the quality of service of other modes of public transport, and bring them at par with TNVS not by back-pedaling on the standards in place we have today.” In fact, the government might just be able to hit two birds with one stone. By learning how to adapt these advancements to benefit our taxi drivers, the government might be able to finally solve the problem surrounding the outdated taxi and bus boundary system that benefits no one but the franchise holders. While doing so, the government should definitely expedite its plan on improving, building, and expanding our train and bus systems. Let us step back and go beyond Uber and Grab. Let us pressure the government to provide an efficient public transportation that we deserve.  Because, honestly, with an efficient train system and better public transportation in general, discussions like these would be irrelevant and everyone would be happy. – Rappler.com   Raisa Serafica is a community manager and social media producer for MovePH, Rappler’s civic-engagement arm "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/175950-analysis-cracking-down-uber-grab-hurt-commuters/","title":"Cracking down on Uber and Grab will hurt commuters, not protect them","date":"Jul 18, 2017 1:23 PM PHT","snippet":"Just how valuable have Uber and Grab become for Filipino commuters?","body":"The daily commute around Metro Manila is bad as it is. But impending government regulations are about to make it downright painful. Starting July 26, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will apprehend and fine Uber and Grab drivers, and impound their cars, if found lacking the necessary permits. Before this, LTFRB fined Uber and Grab P5 million each for allowing such illegal or “colorum” vehicles to ply the streets. The LTFRB maintains that this crackdown is meant to protect commuters. One official said, “Paramount to LTFRB is the demand and the need [of the] riding public.” But will this crackdown really help commuters? In this article we argue that, given the significant value of ride-hailing services to Filipino commuters, this crackdown will invariably hurt the riding public, not protect them. Consumer value  Just how valuable have Uber and Grab become for Filipino commuters? In the US, a famous study found that UberX generated about $6.8 billion worth of “consumer surplus” in 2015 alone. That is, each dollar spent on UberX generated $1.60 worth of extra welfare for consumers—a hefty 60% return. Consumer surplus is difficult to measure, and to our knowledge no similar study in the Philippines yet exists (we are open to collaborate with Uber or Grab on this). However, one need only imagine our lives before Uber and Grab came along. Filipinos are tired of dealing with rude and crooked taxi drivers who refuse passengers based on their destinations, use rigged meters, charge arbitrary fares, and – for some reason – are always out of change. Uber and Grab allowed us to escape that horrible era. And based on commuters’ recent protests online, they’re not having more of it again. {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmario.limos%2Fposts%2F10155541327053147&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”626″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source} A crackdown will hurt commuters While Uber and Grab are a big win for commuters, they are a big loss for owners of regular taxis. With diminishing ridership and eroding profits, it comes as no surprise that regular taxi owners worldwide are intensely lobbying for government protection against ride-hailing. At the very least, regular taxi owners ask for a level playing field: that ride-hailing services be subjected to the same regulations as regular taxis. On the other extreme, some taxi owners call for a near or total prohibition of ride-hailing. Such a crackdown could indeed work in their favor: With prohibitive quotas on Uber and Grab vehicles, commuters will have no choice but to resort to regular taxis once more, thus increasing their market share and profits. Remaining Uber and Grab patrons will necessarily face higher prices and longer waiting times. By far, the biggest loss would come from the Uber and Grab rides that commuters can no longer hail. LTFRB’s crackdown next week promises to do just this. Around 80% of all ride-hailing vehicles are considered “colorum” by LTFRB, and cracking down on them could effectively cripple Uber and Grab’s operations. This move might raise the profits of a handful of taxi operators, but at what cost? The daily welfare of hundreds of thousands of Filipino commuters. “Colorum” not by choice Even more troubling is that many Uber and Grab drivers seem to have no choice but to be branded as “colorum.” For a year now, the LTFRB has stopped accepting and processing applications for Uber, Grab, and Uhop. In the process, 7,000 accredited drivers were denied renewal of their temporary permits, and as of January around 15,000 franchise applications have been denied. Hence, it appears that Uber and Grab drivers’ “colorum” status is not from a lack of effort to comply with LTFRB’s rules, but rather from LTFRB’s failure to act on these applications. To make matters worse, the LTFRB even threatened to discontinue Uber and Grab’s accreditations altogether if they “continue to defy the order.” One might ask: what is licensing good for, anyway, when “licensed” has come to mean rude and devious taxi drivers, and “colorum” is associated with courteous and honest Uber and Grab drivers? The term “colorum” should also be understood beyond its purely legalistic or regulatory sense: economically, it is a manifestation of an excess demand for rides. Quotas prevent the occurrence of mutually beneficial trades, so they will always incentivize “colorum” activities to make supply meet demand – irrespective of what the law says. Moreover, “colorum” was coined at a time when no technology was available to monitor vehicles and reward good customer service in real time. But with Uber and Grab, commuters can use their mobile apps to identify drivers, trace their routes, and rate their rides. Any errant driver can be easily made accountable, and drivers themselves can rate their passengers! Creative destruction Regulators also worry that Uber and Grab’s fast growth could worsen traffic congestion in the metro. But insofar as such vehicles are substitutes to taxis of the old, the growing fleets of Uber and Grab should pose no problem if we let old modes of transportation exit the roads. Indeed, every episode of rapid technological change brings with it some amount of unemployment, and is usually met by fierce opposition. In the same way that the horse-drawn carriage gave way to the automobile, the telegraph yielded to the telephone, and printed encyclopedias succumbed to the internet – the taxi industry is now reeling from the “creative destruction” brought forth by ride-hailing. But in the face of irreversible technological change, the best response is to embrace the new technology and assist those who lose their jobs in the process – not to shun or ban the new technology altogether.   Of course, this transition will require moving displaced people to alternative occupations. But in the case of taxi drivers, this need not be too difficult: with minimal training, for example, they can easily apply and work as drivers of ride-hailing services. Uber and Grab users, unite! What the majority of Filipinos need and deserve is an efficient, reliable, and safe mass transport system of trains and buses. But for a sizable segment of the riding public, Uber and Grab have provided a new, innovative, and viable option to move around the metro. Rather than just mere passing fads, ride-hailing services are here to stay. That is why a policy that prohibits 80% of ride-hailing vehicles will needlessly take away the level of convenience and dependability that commuters have come to love – and regular taxis routinely fail to provide. In a rare display of unity, commuters are protesting LTFRB’s impending crackdown in social media. An online petition to lift LTFRB’s suspension on new permit applications has already garnered 96,000 signatures, and counting. The LTFRB says they will “not succumb to pressure.” But this raises the question: whose interests are they really protecting? The advent of new technologies may catch regulators off guard. But this is hardly an excuse for them to add to the country’s roster of stupid and ridiculous policies – we already have enough of them to go around with. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan (@jcpunongbayan) is a PhD student at the UP School of Economics.

The TransAsia Airways flight was carrying 54 passengers and 4 crew when it smashed into trees and houses as it attempted to land in a typhoon on Taiwan’s scenic Penghu island. Just 9 people survived. Lee Chia-feng and Ching Yuan-wu – who were responsible for runway use and landing approval – were charged last year with negligence over the incident. But while acknowledging that the officers made errors, the Penghu district court said the crash was ultimately down to the pilots, who were among those killed. “The main cause of the accident was because the flight crew did not follow the standard landing procedures,” the court said in a statement. “Operating a flight is highly dependent on the front-line crew acting in accordance with their training and standards. This is even more so during a typhoon, when the climate can change quickly.” The Aviation Safety Council said in its investigation report last year the pilots were flying below the minimum altitude required in poor visibility in a procedural mistake widespread among TransAsia’s pilots at the time. Less than a year after the Penghu accident, another TransAsia flight dramatically crashed into a river shortly after take-off from Taipei, killing 43 people and raising serious concerns about the airline’s safety standards. The dramatic crash of flight GE235 in February 2015 grabbed global headlines as car dashcam footage showed it clipping a road bridge before careering into the water. An investigation blamed a catalogue of pilot errors, with one found to have mistakenly switched off the only functioning engine after the other had failed. TransAsia, Taiwan’s first private airline, said it had introduced 6 training programs following the two crashes. But the troubled airline was forced to shut down in November last year after the two deadly accidents, while also suffering massive financial losses and an insider trading probe. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/bahasa-indonesia/164576-manajemen-taksi-online-tolak-revisi-aturan-kemenhub-nomor-32/","title":"Manajemen transportasi online ramai-ramai tolak revisi aturan Kemenhub","date":"Mar 18, 2017 8:44 PM PHT","snippet":"Pemerintah akan memberlakukan revisi aturan Permenhub nomor 32 tahun 2016, pada 1 April 2017.","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Polemik mengenai keberadaan transportasi online di Indonesia belum usai. Kendati aturan sudah sempat dikeluarkan oleh Ignasius Jonan ketika masih menjadi Menteri Perhubungan tahun 2016 lalu, tetapi aksi protes tetap terjadi. Para pengemudi taksi konvensional dan sopir angkutan umum sempat menggelar aksi demonstrasi besar-besaran. Bahkan, dalam aksi demo di Bandung, sempat menghancurkan kendaraan milik warga. Keluarga Asep Kusmara dikepung oleh pengemudi sopir angkot ketika sedang terjadi aksi demo besar-besaran di depan Gedung Sate. Celakanya, mobil Toyota Avanza yang tengah dikendarai oleh puteranya, Eggy Muhammad Juniardi dirusak oleh para pendemo. (BACA: Korban perusakan mobil oleh sopir angkot masih alami trauma) Mereka mengira mobil yang dikendarai oleh Eggy adalah taksi online. Pada kenyataannya, tuduhan tersebut tidak terbukti. Aksi unjuk rasa juga terjadi di kota Malang, Makassar dan Tangerang. Kementerian Perhubungan terus berupaya mencari solusi untuk meredakan konflik. Upaya kemudian datang dari Direktorat Jenderal Perhubungan Darat Kemenhub. Mereka melakukan revisi terhadap Peraturan Menteri nomor 32 tahun 2016. Kini, mereka sedang melakukan sosialisasi terhadap revisi aturan tersebut. Sosialisasi sudah dilakukan di Jakarta pada 17 Februari lalu. Selanjutnya, uji coba kedua dilakukan di Makassar pada 10 Maret. “Pelaksanaan Peraturan Menteri Perhubungan (PM) nomor 32 tahun 2016 perlu dilakukan penyempurnaan, oleh sebab itu Kementerian Perhubungan melakukan uji publik atas revisi PM 32 tahun 2016 dengan tujuan untuk mendapatkan masukan dan tanggapan dari masyarakat serta pihak terkait sebelum payung hukum ini diberlakukan,” ujar Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Darat, Pudji Hartanto melalui keterangan tertulis. Rencananya revisi PM itu akan diberlakukan pada bulan April 2017. Berikut isi 11 poin revisi PM nomor 32 tahun 2016 mengenai penyelenggaraan angkutan orang tidak dalam trayek. Tetapi, revisi itu tidak disambut secara positif oleh para pelaku transportasi online. Pihak Grab Indonesia menolak revisi PM nomor 32 tahun 2016 tersebut. Managing Director PT Grab Indonesia, Ridzki Khramadibrata mengatakan keberatan terhadap tiga poin dalam revisi PM itu. “Keberatan kami yakni mengenai penetapan tarif atas dan bawah, kuota kendaraan dan balik nama,” ujar Ridzki ketika memberikan keterangan pers pada Jumat, 17 Maret. Dia menjelaskan alasan utama menolak revisi peraturan menteri itu karena menyangkut kesejahteraan penumpang dan pengendara Grab Indonesia. Dengan diberlakukan batas tarif atas dan bawah, artinya harga yang nantinya dibayar konsumen tidak lagi semurah biasanya. “Jika ada tarif atas dan bawah, maka akan membawa kita kembali ke era konvensional. Padahal, teknologi transportasi seperti Grab malah bertujuan memajukan bidang tersebut,” kata dia. Sementara, jika armada dibatasi, maka hal tersebut tidak sesuai dengan kebutuhan pasar. Sehingga, hal itu ujung-ujungnya malah merugikan pelanggan karena mereka menjadi sulit memperoleh akses kendaraan yang terjangkau. “STNK balik nama perusahaan juga mematikan hak kepemilikan kendaraan pada mitra pengendara kami,” tutur Ridzki. Tiga penolakan itu turut didukung oleh penyedia jasa transportasi online lainnya seperti Go-Jek dan Uber. Ketiganya kompak mengatakan bahwa peraturan tersebut tidak sejalan dengan ekonomi kerakyatan yang disebut sebagai pilar bangsa oleh Presiden Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. Sementara, untuk aturan yang lain, ketiganya mengaku tidak keberatan. Mereka mengatakan siap mendanai uji KIR bagi kendaraan mitra pengemudi. Tujuannya, agar tidak menjadi beban pemerintah. “Pada dasarnya kami tetap berkomitmen untuk mendukung pemerintah dengan memberikan informasi secara aktif, efektif dan transparan kepada mitra pengemudi,” kata dia. Namun, manajemen dari ketiga perusahaan itu meminta tenggang waktu kepada pemerintah selama sembilan bulan untuk memastikan proses transisi itu berjalan lancar.   Isi revisi sesuai keinginan pengemudi?  Sementara, Ketua Advokasi Masyarakat Transportasi Indonesia, Dharmaningtyas justru mengatakan dua dari tiga poin yang ditolak oleh manajemen transportasi malah berasal dari aspirasi mitra pengemudi. Dua poin yang didukung oleh mitra pengemudi yakni soal pemberlakuan tarif atas dan bawah serta pembatasan jumlah armada. Tetapi, perwakilan Asosiasi Mitra Pengemudi Grab Car, Puguh Winarko menolak pernyataan yang menyebut dua poin itu atas aspirasi para pengemudi. Sayangnya pernyataan Puguh berbeda dengan keluhan yang disampaikan oleh salah satu mitra pengemudi Grab Bike bernama Rikcy. Kepada Rappler, Ricky mengaku tarif yang diberlakukan oleh manajemen Grab Indonesia berada di bawah rata-rata tarif normal. Selain itu, jumlah armada saat ini sudah terlalu banyak, sehingga menambah beban bagi mitra pengemudi. “Kalau kami pada waktu siang hari tarifnya Rp 1.500,00 per kilometer, dibanding yang lain jauh (perbedaannya). Apalagi sampai sekarang Grab masih membuka lowongan buat pengendara baru. Alhasil, saingan semakin banyak,” kata Ricky. Belum lagi mereka juga harus menghadapi persaingan dari kompetitornya. Ricky juga mengatakan tidak ada transparansi dari Grab Indonesia mengenai pembayaran mereka. Asuransi yang sempat dijanjikan juga tidak memiliki kejelasan. “Saya tidak pernah tanda tangan apa-apa soal asuransi,” tuturnya. Ketika dikonfirmasi kepada Ridzki, dia menampik pernyataan tersebut. Malah, menurut dia, mitra pengemudi mendapatkan kenaikan pendapatan setelah bergabung di Grab Indonesia. “Mitra kami itu mendapatkan penambahan hasil hingga 25%-40%. Mereka juga mendapatkan asuransi dan tim Grab di sini responsif. Mereka siap turun langsung ke lapangan seandainya ditemukan insiden. Saya yakin belum ada yang seperti itu di Indonesia,” ujarnya.

Desakan itu disampaikan dalam aksi demonstrasi yang dilakukan di Alun-Alun Utara kota Yogyakarta pada Jumat, 15 Februari. Ada ratusan pengemudi yang terlibat dalam aksi unjuk rasa. Mereka mengawali aksi dengan berjalan kaki dari Jalan Malioboro. Selain berorasi, mereka juga memampang berbagai poster berisi kecaman terhadap taksi berbasis online. “Operator taksi mati, malah pengemudinya mati duluan,” kata Koordinator Aksi Komunitas Pengemudi, Sutiman di Alun-Alun Utara Kota Yogyakarta pada Jumat, 15 Februari. Dia mengatakan para peserta aksi baru separuh dari total pengemudi taksi konvensional di Yogyakarta. Sebagian pengemudi taksi lainnya tetap beroperasi agar pemberian layanan terhadap penumpang tidak terganggu. “Tapi, kalau tidak ada kemajuan, (kami) akan all out turun semua,” kata dia. Saat ini, tercatat ada 20 operator taksi di Yogyakarta. Dengan armada mencapai 1.025 unit, masing-masing operator mengoperasikan sekitar 60 unit kendaraan. Sementara, jumlah pengemudi mencapai 2.500 orang. Sutiman mengatakan sejak marak beroperasinya taksi berbasis online, pendapatan para pengemudi taksi konvensional turun drastis. Taksi Pamungkas Primkoppol, tempat Sutiman bekerja misalnya, mewajibkan setiap pengemudi menyetor Rp 270 ribu per hari. “Tetapi, sekarang paling banter sehari mendapat Rp 150 ribu,” kata dia. Perolehan per hari itu belum termasuk untuk keperluan membeli bahan bakar kendaraan, makan dan upah yang dibawa pulang ke rumah. Akibatnya, banyak pengemudi berhutang setoran pada perusahaan. Tiap perusahaan taksi menetapkan batasan berbeda untuk hutang setoran pengemudi. Jumlahnya beragam, dimulai dari Rp 300 ribu hingga Rp 500 ribu. Jika hutang setoran melebihi batas, maka pengemudi dilarang beroperasi. Sulit beradaptasi Sebenarnya sebagian besar operator taksi konvensional di Yogyakarta sudah mulai menerapkan aplikasi online untuk menggaet pelanggan. Tetapi, tak semua pengemudi menerapkan untuk mencari penumpang. “Susah (menggunakannya),” kata Sarwidi alias Kacung, pengemudi Taksi Sadewo pada Jumat, 17 Februari. Taksi Sadewo kata dia juga sudah menerapkan aplikasi bernama Taxies. Aplikasi yang dipasang di telepon genggam itu juga dimanfaatkan oleh dua operator taksi lainnya yakni Indra Kelana dan Pandawa. Tetapi, bagi lelaki 49 tahun itu, jangankan untuk mengoperasikan fiturnya, menggunakan telepon genggam layar sentuh pun dia kesulitan. 10 tahun bekerja menjadi pengemudi taksi, dia terbiasa mengandalkan radio panggil yang terpasang di kendaraan untuk mendapat penumpang. Hal itu semakin diperparah dengan menjamurnya taksi berbasis online seperti Grab Car dan Go Car. Pasalnya, sejak beroperasi di Yogyakarta membuat penghasilan mereka anjlok drastis. Penumpang memilih menumpang taksi online yang tarifnya lebih murah. Sering kali ia tidak mendapat penumpang. Padahal, Sarwidi harus mengumpulkan uang setoran senilai Rp 280 ribu setiap harinya kepada perusahaan. Selain menerapkan aplikasi berbasis telepon genggam, ada juga perusahaan taksi yang menawarkan undian berhadiah bagi penumpang. Tetapi, toh strategi itu tak cukup menarik penumpang. Faktor tarif tetap menjadi daya tarik. Ketua III Organisasi Angkutan Darat Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta yang membidangi unit taksi, Taryoto, mengatakan salah satu alasan harga taksi online bisa murah karena mereka tidak mengurus persyaratan seperti izin trayek, pajak dan uji KIR. “Sementara, kalau kami di taksi argometer pakai itu,” ujar Taryoto. Gubernur Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwono X mengatakan kendaraan berplat hitam dilarang beroperasi sebagai angkutan umum. Untuk mengatasi persoalan itu, ia berjanji akan berkomunikasi dengan Kementerian Perhubungan di Jakarta, Senin pekan depan. “Wewenangnya bukan di saya,” kata Sri Sultan. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/147787-berita-hari-ini-jumat-30-september-2016/","title":"Berita hari ini: Jumat, 30 September 2016","date":"Sep 30, 2016 9:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Pantau terus laman ini untuk memperbarui berita terbaru pilihan redaksi Rappler Indonesia pada Jumat, 30 September 2016","body":"Indonesia wRap: Jumat, 30 September 2016 Dari suami-istri jual bayi karena tak mampu bayar biaya persalinan hingga Herawati Diah wafat  Pasangan suami istri terpaksa menjual bayi mereka demi menutupi biaya persalinan di Rumah Sakit Universitas Hasanudin, Makassar.

KPK setuju jika koruptor diberi sanksi sosial seperti menyapu jalan  Ketua Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (KPK), Agus Rahardjo mengatakan setuju dengan wacana adanya sanksi sosial bagi para koruptor. Salah satu contoh sanksi sosial yang kini tengah hangat dibicarakan yaitu menyapu jalan raya. Ide itu disampaikan oleh mantan Ketua Mahkamah Konstitusi (MK), Harjono. Berdasarkan data, Indonesia baru menghukum seumur hidup dua terpidana korupsi yakni Akil Mochtar dan Adrian Waworuntu. Kendati sudah dijatuhi beragam hukuman lain mulai dari pidana pokok hingga pencabutan hak politik, pada kenyataannya para koruptor tidak jera. “Makanya, kalau punya ide apa sih sanksi sosial yang perlu kita terapkan pada koruptor ya (menurut saya) perlu ada dan bentuknya bisa macam-macam,” ujar Agus. Dan Agus mengakui kemungkinan dengan diberi sanksi sosial, para koruptor ke depannya akan kapok dan tak lagi mencuri uang dan hak rakyat. Selengkapnya baca di Detik.

Selain mengatur taksi konvensional, dalam PM ini juga mengatur soal operasi taksi online, seperti Uber, Grab, dan Go-Car. Meskipun berlaku mulai 1 Oktober, tapi masih tahap sosialisasi selama 6 bulan. Pelanggaran tidak akan diberikan hukuman. PM ini rencananya baru diberlakukan sepenuhnya pada 1 April 2017. “Untuk penertiban terhadap penyelenggaraan PM ini, petugas lebih mengutamakan kegiatan pembinaan dan pencegahan dengan melakukan sosialisasi, pemberitahuan, dan dialog, daripada penegakan hukum,” tutur Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Darat Pudji Hartanto Iskandar, Rabu, 28 September di kantor Kementerian Perhubungan, Jakarta.

Pengemudi dan perusahaan penyedia aplikasi tidak boleh berhubungan secara langsung Perusahaan/lembaga penyedia aplikasi tidak dapat menjadi penyelenggara angkutan umum.  Maka, para perusahaan/lembaga tersebut tidak boleh menetapkan tarif dan memungut bayaran, merekrut pengemudi, serta menentukan besaran penghasilan pengemudi. Siapa yang menentukan tarif? Perusahaan/lembaga/koperasi pengelola angkutan umum yang berwenang untuk menentukan tarif. Berbeda dengan taksi konvensional, hingga saat ini pemerintah belum akan menentukan tarif bawah dari taksi online. Seluruhnya diserahkan pada para lembaga pengelola angkutan umum. Selain menentukan tarif, pengelola angkutan umum juga bertugas menjadi lembaga perekrut pengemudi. Jadi, para pengemudi tidak lagi bisa mendaftarkan diri secara langsung ke perusahaan penyedia aplikasi, melainkan harus melalui lembaga pengelola angkutan umum yang berbadan hukum dan terdaftar di Indonesia. Tak semua mobil bisa jadi taksi online Jika sebelumnya seluruh mobil pribadi bisa digunakan sebagai kendaraan untuk taksi online, dalam PM 32/2016 diatur agar Surat Tanda Nomor Kendaraan (STNK) yang dari kendaraan bersangkutan harus menyertakan nama perusahaan pengelola angkutan umum. Kendaraan juga harus lolos uji kelayakan kendaraan bermotor (uji KIR) serta memiliki tanda khusus berupa stiker sebelum diperbolehkan mengangkut penumpang. Sementara, jika sebelumnya siapapun bisa mendaftar sebagai pengemudi, dengan PM 32/2016 para calon pengemudi harus memiliki SIM A Umum.

At any given time, thousands are on the move: heading to the office, going home, running from one meeting to another. All this movement is a burden to a transport system that’s woefully inadequate to deal with the demand. The trains are either bursting at the seams or suffering technical glitches; buses are full to brimming. Private cars with a passenger or two crawl along EDSA, while passengers try to hail taxis sometimes pressured to pay additional tips. In the last couple of years, the Philippines has seen the entry of app-based ride-hailing services that provide passengers with transport options at the touch of a button. Uber and Grab are the best-known names in the industry, providing passengers with their own cars simply by using their smartphones. But critics say these services are exacerbating the traffic problem. They point out that enterprising businessmen buy more vehicles and hire drivers for Uber and Grab, essentially increasing the number of vehicles crowding an already congested road network. Transport officials have underscored their focus in proposing solutions: move more people, not cars. Last year, the Metropolitan Manila Development Agency launched an app to encourage Facebook friends to start carpooling. There have also been suggestions to allot a high-occupancy lane along EDSA exclusively for cars with 3 or more passengers. (READ: Taming Manila traffic: Hits and misses of 2015) Last month, Uber followed suit with the launch of its newest ride-sharing service, uberPOOL. The company said this aims to put more people into fewer cars, coordinating the logistics of a traditional carpool setup using technology. The new service promises a fixed fare that’s estimated to be 25% cheaper than usual UberX fares. In exchange for cheaper fares, passengers have to share the ride with others, and they should expect longer travel time as the vehicle makes several detours to pick up or drop off other riders. As with Uber’s initial launch in Manila two years ago, the concept of uberPOOL carried with it a degree of uncertainty, said Uber Manila’s general manager Laurence Cua. But, he added, Filipinos’ quick adoption to uberPOOL showed that they’re becoming more open to trying out new technology solutions. “I think what we’re learning is that people in the Philippines are very tech-savvy, they’re very progressive, very open-minded about embracing new concepts. And with technology, something like carpooling becomes safer and more convenient because you don’t have to match or pre-plot…With uberPOOL, we knew that we could solve those problems efficiently with a tap of a button,” Cua said. Carpooling with tech But before uberPOOL was launched, another carpooling app had already entered the Philippine market. European carpooling app Wunder launched earlier this year, with the goal of connecting riders with others who have empty seats in their car. Unlike Uber and Grab, trips on Wunder are limited, so that passengers only chip in for the cost of gas as drivers travel to or from their destination. It is not meant to be a profit-making business. The launch of carpooling apps in the Philippines may indicate that Filipinos are not hesitant to take to the ride-sharing concept. (READ: Uberpool in Manila: Adjusting to the metro’s unpredictable traffic) “Carpooling in general is not a very new concept, especially for the Philippines. We’re a very communal people, we’re very friendly. And we don’t mind sharing things, mabait tayo eh…People are just more socially dynamic,” Cua said, noting the positive feedback two weeks since the launch of uberPOOL. But the traditional carpooling setup, where groups of people discuss what time to leave and where to meet up, is a process that’s been made easier by technology. Instead of having to pre-determine carpool trips beforehand, these technology-based apps allow on-demand ride-sharing services. Cutting cars on the road Uber touts its carpool service as a cheaper and more environmentally-friendly option: riders cut their transportation costs, while helping cut down on greenhouse gases with fewer cars on the road. “If you keep doing that again and again, with thousands and hundreds of thousands of people, then you’re now able to make scalable and high-impact changes on how people move around,” he said. But despite this new thrust in the company’s goals, Cua said drivers who want to partner with Uber should not be concerned that the company will also cut down on driver applications. He pointed out that demand for decent transportation in Metro Manila remains high. “As long as there are people who are looking for a ride to get around, then there’s gonna be demand for something like Uber. And so that should not be a concern…We do want to see more drivers use Uber, and the main reason for that is there are people looking for their services,” he said. The carpooling service also aims to discourage people from buying more cars, which end up being underutilized in parking lots anyway, Cua added. But what about criticism that Uber is actually encouraging people to buy more cars? Cua pointed out that car ownership has been steadily growing over the last 10 years, buoyed by more purchasing power for consumers and riding on a growing economy. This, Cua said, happened even before Uber entered the Philippine market. When Uber entered the scene, it became an avenue for drivers to make extra income to help pay for the vehicle that they would have bought anyway, Cua said. He also said that the company is hoping to discuss with government the current limitations on the cars allowed on Uber. Currently, only cars that are 3 years old or newer are allowed on Uber, but Cua said they’re eyeing to relax this as long as the vehicle is still in good shape. By doing this, drivers won’t feel compelled to get a new vehicle, he added. “Rather than having it sit in a parking lot or forcing people to buy new cars, let’s just use what’s out there and put them on UberPOOL, or even just UberX, or both. Now the concept of car-sharing can tap into more underutilized assets,” he said. Complementary government solutions With a new set of officials handling the Metro Manila traffic situation, Cua hopes that ride-sharing can be more widely adopted by Filipinos and readily supported by the new administration. He also said that Internet connectivity should be improved and made more reliable, so that transport solutions that rely on technology would be more efficient. Improving public transportation systems should remain a top priority, he added. In developed countries with efficient public transport, Uber plays a role in addressing the last-mile problem, or ferrying riders from the bus or train station to their final destination. “Here in Manila we know it’s already happening on some level, and as infrastructure gets better, Uber can also play a complementary role to help out those people who use those modes of transport,” he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/135018-tiga-putusan-final-kendaraan-berbasis-aplikasi/","title":"Tiga putusan akhir pemerintah soal angkutan online","date":"Jun 1, 2016 10:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Tiga persyaratan dari pemerintah untuk perusahaan angkutan berbasis aplikasi. Ketiganya wajib untuk dipenuhi.","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Hari ini, pemerintah menyampaikan sikap final atas polemik taksi dalam jaringan (daring) yang sempat mencuat beberapa bulan lalu. Perusahaan angkutan berbasis aplikasi yang beroperasi di Indonesia harus memenuhi sejumlah persyaratan. “Kami telah memfinalisasi bersama Menteri Perhubungan, Menteri Komunikasi dan Informatika, dan Kapolda, Korlantas, serta semua pihak terkait.

Sebelumnya, pemerintah sudah memberi kesempatan bagi perusahaan seperti Uber dan Grab untuk membenahi persyaratan ini pada April lalu. Tenggat waktu itu sudah habis pada 31 Mei kemarin, Tiga syarat yang mereka tetapkan adalah sebagai berikut: 1. Surat Izin Mengemudi (SIM) Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan, yang juga menghadiri rapat, mengatakan pengemudi harus memiliki SIM sesuai jenis kendaraan. “Kalau sedan, ya harus pakai SIM A umum. Tak bisa pakai SIM C,” kata dia. Untuk mobil jenis micro bus, yang memiliki 7 kursi, pengemudi harus memiliki SIM B1. Menurut dia, hal ini tak dapat ditawar lagi. 2. Lulus uji kelayakan (KIR) Syarat kedua adalah kendaraan harus lulus uji KIR. Jonan mengatakan izin tak usah dilakukan di DKI Jakarta, tapi bisa di berbagai tempat perusahaan mobil. Dalam jangka waktu sebulan, Jonan mengatakan baru ada 300 unit Uber dan Grab Car yang sudah mengurus. Padahal, total keseluruhan ada 3.300 unit. 3. STNK Jonan mengharuskan mobil berbasis aplikasi harus memiliki STNK atas nama perusahaan atau koperasi. “Bagaimanapun juga, karena angkutan umum harus berbadan hukum. Kalau bentuknya PT, ya harus atas nama PT. Kalau koperasi, harus atas nama dan sesuai peraturan kperasi,” kata dia. Bila belum memenuhi persyaratan ini, maka mobil tak boleh jalan.

Businessmen turn to air travel to beat traffic jams","date":"Apr 3, 2016 8:30 AM PHT","snippet":"As ground traffic in Manila continues to worsen, traveling by helicopter has become an option for businessmen who don't mind the price tag to buy extra time for their business trips","body":"MANILA, Philippines – It took me a little over two hours to travel from Pasig City to Pasay City, crawling through heavy traffic around the airport area, including a particularly bad 2-kilometer stretch that had me stuck in a car for more than half an hour. But up in the air, onboard one of Asian Aerospace’s helicopters, we managed to fly across 4 cities in Metro Manila in a little over 10 minutes. With the Philippine capital region continuing to suffer from worsening traffic, making road travel between cities an hours-long trip, the rich and the powerful are turning to air travel as their preferred mode of transport. It’s fast, efficient, and hassle-free, but the price tag certainly doesn’t come cheap: For P50,000 a month, businessmen and multinational CEOs can access Asian Aerospace’s fleet of private jets and helicopters through its recently-launched service AirTaxi.PH. The cost may be too much for the ordinary commuter, but Asian Aerospace’s executive vice president, Peter Angelo Rodriguez, considers it an affordable deal for company executives who don’t want to waste entire business days stuck in Manila’s notorious traffic jams. AirTaxi.PH, launched in January 2016, promises stress-free travel to members of its Emerald Class. To book a ride, members only need to call up Asian Aerospace and specify the time and location where they want to be picked up. Rodriguez said the company currently has helicopters and planes stationed in Manila, Clark, Cebu, and Boracay. The P50,000 monthly fee is consumable, and depends on the type of aircraft requested by clients. For instance, an inter-Metro Manila trip using a 6-seater twin-engine helicopter will cost P42,000. Meanwhile, clients who book one other helicopter used in Boracay trips, which costs P13,500 a ride, can have 3 flights per month. Since launching in January, Rodriguez said there has been an increase in demand and positive feedback from their existing base of clients who are turning to air travel to avoid hours-long traffic jams and get to to their business appointments faster. The service is practical for use in Manila, he said, because of the availability of helipads in business areas such as Ortigas, Makati, and Bonifacio Global City. “Everything inter-Metro Manila is 5 minutes. If you need to go to Greenhills, or Makati, it’s just 5 minutes. It’s like you cut your driving time [by half] already,” he said.  Aside from providing faster travel for their clients, Rodriguez pointed one offshoot of more businessmen going the route of air travel. Since VIPs often travel in packs or with convoys of bodyguards, providing air transport will mean that these VIPs’ vehicles will be off the road, and won’t be adding to ground traffic congestion. “That’s going to remove them [from the road] and already bring them to the location where they need to be,” he said. Aside from its practical use, Rodriguez said the service can also be used for leisure, medical needs, and disaster relief and response. In the popular island destination Boracay, for instance, the company offers a service called Green Heli that offers helicopter rides for tourists. Asian Aerospace also has air ambulances, equipped with medical teams, that can respond to their clients’ emergency. In last year’s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, the company was tapped as support medical assistance for dignitaries and state leaders visiting for the regional meet. It was also involved in relief efforts in the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), bringing in relief goods and evacuating people from the disaster site.   Future plans Asian Aerospace’s offering of a helicopter service for Manila came about two months since two popular app-based ride-sharing services, Uber and Grab, announced that they would be offering their own helicopter services as an addition to their lineup of car-hailing services.  Grab’s pre-booking chopper service, GrabHeli, offers passengers an aerial tour of Makati City, Bonifacio Global City, and Pasay City for P3,888 per person. Passengers will be given GrabCar promo codes to take them to or from PhilJets’ helipad at the Manila Domestic Airport. The service, however, was a promotional one. The Grab mobile app no longer displays an option to select the GrabHeli service. For Rodriguez, Grab’s rate was “very very cheap” for a helicopter ride. But he also pointed out that it only offered an aerial tour instead of a point-to-point service.  Asked if AirTaxi.PH would introduce a similar scheme for its clients, Rodriguez said that they are eyeing a ride-sharing setup once they have built up their customer base. For now, they are focusing on expanding the areas where their air fleet are stationed around the country. “What we want to do is we want to station helicopters and planes around the country. Right now we’ve got Luzon and Visayas covered, next target is Mindanao,” he said. “As soon as this becomes  a regular thing, and we have enough customers, one of our programs here is that you can split your flight due with other members. For example, there’s 4 of you flying at 9 am. You can just go together, and we’re just going to put you on one flight,” he said. “In the end, you’re not going to pay P42,000, you’re just going to pay P10,500 each. So it’s a nice way of contributing a little bit to what we can do to ease the traffic,” he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/126903-kemenhub-operasi-grabcar-uber-taksi-ilegal/","title":"Kemenhub: Operasi Grab Car dan Uber Taksi ilegal","date":"Mar 23, 2016 6:31 PM PHT","snippet":"Kedua perusahan diminta memilih: Menjadi operator transportasi atau tetap sebagai aplikasi","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Kementerian Perhubungan memastikan pengoperasian Grab Car dan Uber Taksi ilegal karena tidak memenuhi ketentuan dalam Undang-Undang Nomor 22 Tahun 2009 Tentang Lalu Lintas Angkutan Jalan. “Dengan memperhatikan seluruh pasal-pasal Undang-Undang Nomor 22 Tahun 2009 Tentang Lalu Lintas Angkutan Jalan, sampai dengan hari ini operasi dari sisi aturan LLAJ adalah ilegal,” kata Pelaksana Tugas Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Darat Kementerian Perhubungan Sugihardjo dalam konferensi pers di Jakarta, Rabu, 23 Maret.  Sugihardjo mengatakan dalam undang-undang tersebut pengoperasian kedua aplikasi bertentangan karena termasuk kompetitor taksi. Untuk itu, Sugihardjo mengatakan pihaknya memberikan pilihan kepada kedua aplikasi tersebut untuk menjadi operator transportasi atau tetap sebagai aplikasi. Apabila menjadi operator transportasi, dia menuturkan, kedua aplikasi tersebut harus memiliki izin penyelenggaraan angkutan umum dari Dinas Perhubungan DKI Jakarta. “Misalnya menjadi perusahaan taksi, berarti harus ada argometer dan tanda khusus yang diberikan oleh kepolisian,” katanya. Selain itu, lanjut dia, pengemudi harus memiliki sim A atau sim B umum sesuai dengan jenis kendaraan yang dikemudikan. Sementara itu, Sugihardjo mengatakan, apabila Grab Car dan Uber Taksi ingin tetap menjadi perusahaan aplikasi, maka harus bekerja sama dengan perusahaan angkutan resmi yang sudah terdaftar atau koperasi. “Rental di DKI juga banyak dan mereka resmi, silakan kerja sama dengan yang punya izin dan kalau membentuk koperasi silakan juga,” katanya. Legal Manager Uber Indonesia Teddy Trianto mengatakan akan segera menenuhi ketentuan perizinan yang berlaku. “Kami mendorong mitra kami untuk mendapatkan seluruh perizinan sesuai dengan ketentuan pemerintah,” katanya. Sementara itu, Komisaris Uber Technology Indonesia Denny Sutadi juga akan melakukan hal yang sama. “Kami juga meminta pemerintah untuk memberi tahu, berkomunikasi apa-apa yang harus kami lakukan,” katanya.Ketua DPO Organisasi Pengusaha Angkutan Nasional Bermotor di Jalan (Organda) Adrianto Djokosoetono mengapresiasi upaya tersebut dan berjanji akan mencari solusi terbaik untuk semua. –dengan laporan Antara    BACA JUGA:              "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/126843-dpr-dorong-revisi-undang-undang/","title":"Menhub: Tak perlu aturan baru untuk payung hukum transportasi berbasis online","date":"Mar 23, 2016 4:55 PM PHT","snippet":"Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan menganggap aturan yang ada sudah cukup.","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Ketua Komisi V Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (DPR) Fary Djemi Francis mengatakan siap menerima usulan pemerintah untuk payung hukum angkutan transportasi berbasis aplikasi online.

Menurut dia, UU nomor 22 tahun 2009 tentang Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan (LLAJ) sudah cukup. “Tak perlu disiapkan, aturannya sudah ada,” kata dia. Dalam UU ini sudah tercantum persyaratan badan hukum, hingga uji kir. Jonan menilai, persyaratan tersebut penting agar kendaraan tercatat dalam data pemerintah untuk menjamin keselamatan dan keamanan transportasi. Namun, ia tak mengomentari apapun terkait pengaturan tarif transportasi ini. Organda meminta keadilan tarif  Secara terpisah, Ketua Umum DPP Organda Adrianto Djokosoetono mengatakan akan mendiskusikan soal perubahan tarif dengan pemerintah. Keberadaan transportasi berbasis online dengan tarif yang tak diatur menuntut perlunya perubahan dalam sektor ini. “Nanti akan kami bicarakan,” kata salah satu pemegang pucuk pimpinan penyedia jasa layanan taksi Blue Bird ini. Direktur PT Blue Bird, Noni Purnomo, juga menyuarakan hal serupa. Mereka tak mempermasalahkan persaingan dengan teknologi aplikasi, namun akan menuntut keadilan pengaturan tarif.  Grab: kami tak perlu ikut ketentuan tarif BACA JUGA:  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/126732-demonstrasi-tolak-transportasi-online/","title":"Sopir transportasi umum kembali unjuk rasa","date":"Mar 22, 2016 2:21 PM PHT","snippet":"Sementara Go-Jek tetap beroperasi namun tak memakai atribut.","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Para pengemudi angkutan umum yang tergabung dalam Persatuan Pengemudi Angkutan Darat (PPAD) kembali menggelar unjuk rasa hari ini. Mereka masih memprotes keberadaan transportasi berbasis online seperti Grab Car dan Uber. Konsentrasi massa terpecah ke dua titik, yakni gedung Balai Kota DKI Jakarta dan gedung Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat. Sopir angkutan kota, KWK, dan Bajaj berkumpul di titik pertama; sementara sopir taksi dari pelbagai perusahaan beraksi di titik kedua. Menurut Laode Djeni Hasmar selaku koordinator lapangan dan ketua umum Koperasi Wahana Kalpika (KWK) Jakarta, keberadaan transportasi online melanggar undang-undang (UU). “Sudah ilegal, mereka juga menggerus pendapatan dan kesejahteraan kami,” kata dia saat menyampaikan pendapat di depan gedung Balai Kota. Sejak kemunculan jasa transportasi baru ini, 80 persen dari 120 ribu sopir angkutan umum terancam kesejahteraannya. Pendapatan mereka bisa berkurang hingga setengah karena penumpang direbut oleh moda transportasi baru ini. “Bagaimanapun juga kami-kami ini punya istri, anak, dan keluarga yang harus diberi makan. Ini urusan perut,” kata dia. Sulit mendapat 20 ribu Budiman, sopir KWK yang biasa beroperasi di daerah Jakarta Barat, mengakui pendapatannya memang menurun drastis. Pria berusia sekitar 30 tahun ini sehari-hari menempuh trayek dari Cengkareng-Citraland dengan KWK B14. “Dulu saya bisa bawa pulang Rp 150-200 ribu sehari,” kata Budimana yang mengenakan seragam kaus berkerah warna biru langit dan celana jeans. Sekarang angka tersebut berkurang drastis. Ia mengatakan, untuk memperoleh Rp 20.000 saja ia harus bersusah payah. Pendapatan tertingginya sekarang hanya di kisaran Rp 75.000 sampai Rp 90.000.  “Mentok-mentok Rp 120,000,” ujarnya. Masalah ini tak hanya menimpa Budiman, juga puluhan ribu sopir lainnya. Kekhawatiran akan terus berkurangnya pendapatan ini membuat Budiman dan kawan-kawannya memutuskan untuk turun ke jalan. “Kami ikhlas sehari gak kerja untuk demo,” kata dia. Hal yang membuat para sopir semakin berang adalah fakta kalau transportasi ini ternyata melanggar UU nomor Undang-undang (UU) Lalu Lintas Nomor 2 Tahun 2009 tentang Angkutan Umum dan Jalan Raya. Di situ tertulis, kendaraan yang berfungsi sebagai angkutan umum harus berpelat kuning. Sementara kendaraan yang digunakan oleh Uber dan Grab Car berpelat hitam, atau kendaraan untuk penggunaan pribadi. “Mereka ilegal tetapi mengeruk untung banyak. Sedangkan kami yang sudah sesuai aturan malah kesulitan,” kata Laode. Ia menuntut pemerintah untuk cepat menuntaskan masalah ini. Berjanji permudah izin dan kesejahteraan  Massa yang berdemo di Balai Kota diterima oleh Kepala Dinas Perhubungan DKI Jakarta Andri Yansyah. Ia mengatakan aspirasi dan tuntutan mereka akan disampaikan kepada Gubernur DKI Jakarta Basuki Tjahaja Purnama. “Pak Gubernur menjanjikan akan menyediakan sarana transportasi umum yang aman dan tertib, juga menjamin kesejahteraan sopir-sopirnya,” kata Andri, yang disambut sorakan pendemo. Salah satu janji yang ia berikan adalah pemudahan perpanjangan izin trayek angkutan; dan membuat standar acuan kendaraan layak pakai. Namun, terkait dengan tuntutan penghapusan jasa transportasi online, ia mengatakan tak bisa berbuat apa-apa. “Itu urusan Kementerian Perhubungan. Mereka akan mencari solusi untuk mengatasi masalah ini,” kata dia. Laode mengaku puas mendengar tanggapan ini, dan langsung membubarkan demonstrasi. Ia mengatakan tak akan mengadakan unjuk rasa terkait masalah ini lagi. “Selanjutnya kami akan berdialog langsung dengan pemerintah. Tak ada lagi demonstras,” kata dia. Pantauan Rappler, aksi unjuk rasa ini berlangsung damai dan tertib, mulai dari awal hingga akhir. Peserta mengikuti arahan dari polisi penjaga, dan tak ada yang mencoba memicu perkelahian. Bahkan, beberapa kali mereka mengajak polisi untuk ikut bergoyang mengikuti alunan musik dangdut dari pengeras suara. Go-Jek beroperasi sembunyi-sembunyi Sementara itu, para sopir jasa transportasi online hari ini beroperasi sembunyi-sembunyi. Banyak di antara mereka yang sengaja meninggalkan atribut perusahaan untuk menyaru dengan ojek biasa. Heru (bukan nama sebenarnya) termasuk salah satu sopir Go-Jek yang mengikuti cara ini. Sepanjang perjalanan dari Medan Merdeka Selatan ke Sarinah, ia menceritakan peringatan dan taktik kawan-kawannya. “Kemarin sama perusahaan sudah diberitahu jalur-jalur demo yang harus dihindari,” kata dia. Hari itu, ia tak mengenakan jaket Go-Jek, tapi sengaja memakai jaket kulit hitam dan membawa helm berwarna pink polos. Rekannya, menurut dia, juga melakukan hal serupa. Ponsel pun sengaja ia taruh di saku celana, tak dipasang di motor seperti biasa. Kebiasaan itu dapat menjadikan dirinya sasaran amuk demonstran. “Saya juga cuma berani ambil order yang dekat-dekat saja,” kata dia. Setibanya di Sarinah, Heru menemui kawan-kawannya yang juga tak berpakaian seragam. “Pada gak berani ngambil penumpang,” kata dia sembari tersenyum miris. Ia mengaku tak mengerti mengapa demonstrasi ini harus menggunakan kekerasan dan merepotkan banyak pihak. Menurut dia, sebaiknya para pengemudi taksi dan lainnya mulai menyesuaikan diri dengan perkembangan zaman dan teknologi. –Rappler.com BACA JUGA:                "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/126699-foto-demo-sopir-taksi-jakarta/","title":"FOTO: Demo sopir taksi di Jakarta","date":"Mar 22, 2016 9:32 AM PHT","snippet":"Demo sopir taksi akan berpusat di dua titik, depan Gedung DPR RI dan kantor Kemenkominfo","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia — Pengemudi taksi kembali mengadakan unjuk rasa di jalanan Jakarta, Selasa pagi, 22 Maret.

Kali ini, diharapkan pemerintah dapat memberikan solusi yang memuaskan.","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Kisruh antara pengemudi angkutan umum dengan penyedia jasa transportasi online masih belum mencapai titik temu. Setelah berunjuk rasa sepekan lalu, para operator yang tergabung dalam Persatuan Pengemudi Angkutan Darat (PPAD) akan mengulang aksi mereka pada Selasa, 22 Maret. “Masih sama dengan yang kemarin. Kawan-kawan PPAD merasa tak puas dengan hasil kemarin,” kata Ketua Organda DKI Jakarta Shafruhan Sinungan saat dihubungi Rappler pada Senin, 21 Maret 2016. Sesuai dengan surat bernomor 02/PPAD-II/2016 yang dilayangkan ke Polda Metro Jaya, PPAD masih menuntut pemerintah untuk membekukan penyedia jasa transportasi online seperti Grab Car dan Uber. Menurut mereka, keberadaan angkutan ini menyalahi Undang-undang (UU) Lalu Lintas Nomor 2 Tahun 2009 tentang Angkutan Umum dan Jalan Raya. Di situ tertulis, kendaraan yang berfungsi sebagai angkutan umum harus berpelat kuning. Sementara kendaraan yang digunakan oleh Uber dan Grab Car berpelat hitam, atau kendaraan untuk penggunaan pribadi. Keadilan bagi seluruh penyedia jasa transportasi Shafruhan memuji keputusan pemerintah yang akhirnya memberikan badan hukum bagi Grab Car dan Uber, yakni koperasi. Namun, hal tersebut masih belum cukup. Masih ada sejumlah masalah lain yang harus diselesaikan. Selain masalah pelat, ada pula standar penetapan tarif dan izin pengelolaan. Shafruhan menilai Uber dan Grab telah menginjak-injak pemerintah dan UU dengan cara menetapkan tarif yang semena-mena. “Dia harus memperoleh izin pengelolaan angkutan umum dari pemerintah, seperti perusahaan taksi ataupun mobil rental. Kan semuanya sudah diatur, termasuk tariff juga dari pemerintah,” kata dia. Selain itu, mobil-mobil yang beroperasi di bawah naungan Uber dan Grab juga harus sudah melalui uji kir. “Kalau mereka (Uber dan Grab) seenaknya sendiri seperti ini, kan artinya sama dengan telah menampar pemerintah. UU kan yang buat pemerintah juga, kok dilanggar,” kata Shafruhan. Ia berharap unjuk rasa besok merupakan yang terakhir, dan pemerintah bisa segera mengambil keputusan yang adil bagi kedua belah pihak.  Menurut dia, para supir sudah mengikhlaskan waktu kerja dan penghasilan mereka dalam sehari untuk menuntut keadilan. “Kalau belum tuntas juga, kami belum tahu akan mengambil langkah apa lagi,” kata dia. Pastikan unjuk rasa damai dan bebas penyusup Shafruhan mengimbau agar unjuk rasa kali ini tetap berjalan dengan damai tanpa ada tindak kekerasan. Besok, ia memperkirakan ada 20 ribu orang yang akan mengikuti unjuk rasa dari seluruh pelosok Jakarta. “Sudah saya ingatkan agar menggunakan atribut penanda. Tujuannya menghindari provokasi dari penyusup,” kata dia. Atribut dapat berupa seragam, atau penanda kain hitam di lengan kiri seperti sebelumnya. Unjuk rasa pada pekan lalu memang menelan korban satu unit kendaraan Grab Car, yang dihancurkan salah satu kelompok demonstran. Namun, Shafruhan mengatakan belum tentu pelakunya anggota PPAD. “Bisa saja ada penyusup yang mau provokasi. Pokoknya sudah saya imbau supaya jangan terbawa emosi,” kata dia. Aksi besok masih akan memakai rute yang sama dengan sebelumnya. Dari pelbagai titik di Jakarta, massa akan bergerak menuju dua titik, yakni gedung Dewan Perwakilan Rayat dan Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika. Demonstrasi sendiri akan berlangsung mulai pukul 9 pagi hingga pukul 17.30. Untuk itu, armada Go-Jek, Grab Bike, Car, Taxi, dan Uber diimbau untuk tak melewati area tersebut. -Rappler.com BACA JUGA:                            "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/125731-sopir-taksi-tolak-uber-grabtaxi/","title":"Pro dan kontra penggunaan transportasi aplikasi online","date":"Mar 15, 2016 6:24 PM PHT","snippet":"Pengemudi taksi tolak keberadaan UBER dan GrabTaxi yang dinilai 'menghancurkan sopir kecil'","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia — (UPDATED) Ribuan pengendara angkutan darat yang terdiri dari sopir taksi, metromini, bajaj, dan angkot berunjuk rasa pada Senin, 14 Maret di dekat Istana Negara. Mereka menuntut agar transportasi berbasis aplikasi online segera ditutup. Salah satu perwakilan dari Paguyuban Pengendara Angkutan Darat (PPAD), Suwardi mengatakan ada sekitar 15 ribu demonstran yang ikut turun ke jalan. “Kami menuntut agar aplikasi online tersebut segera ditutup, karena sudah menyengsarakan pengemudi angkutan umum resmi,” ujar Suwardi yang merupakan sopir taksi Blue Bird. Dari armada taksi tempatnya bekerja, masing-masing pull mengirimkan 40 orang untuk berdemonstrasi. Belum lagi dari armada taksi lainnya. Semula mereka berkumpul dan berorasi di depan Balai Kota serta menuntut untuk bertemu Gubernur DKI Jakarta, Basuki “Ahok” Tjahja Purnama. Namun, perwakilan hanya bisa bertemu dengan Kepala Dinas Perhubungan. Dari sana, mereka berjalan kaki menuju ke area Monas di dekat Istana Negara. Suwardi menjelaskan sejak transportasi umum berbasis aplikasi online beroperasi, penghasilan mereka menurun drastis. Salah satu rekannya yang bekerja di armada taksi Express hanya bisa menyetor sekitar Rp150 ribu hingga Rp200 ribu. Padahal, sebelumnya, rekannya itu bisa menyetor hingga Rp300 ribu. “Saya sendiri hanya bisa setor ke perusahaan. Komisi untuk dibawa pulang tidak ada,” keluh Suwardi.  Akibat berkurangnya pemasukan tiap bulan, banyak rekannya yang tidak sanggup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan sehari-hari seperti membayar kontrakan. Bahkan, ada istri yang meminta cerai. Dia mengatakan kantor pusat Blue Bird merestui niat mereka berdemonstrasi. Baginya lebih baik dia dan sopir taksi lainnya berdemonstrasi hari ini, ketimbang tidak ada kejelasan di masa depan mengenai persaingan yang tidak sehat tersebut. “Kami bukannya mempermasalahkan kalah saing dengan transportasi berbasis online. Selama mereka menaati aturan-aturan yang sudah ada, membayar pajak, jika mereka taksi maka mereka memasang plat kuning, ada argo dan tera, kami tidak mempermasalahkan,” papar Suwardi. Sementara, setiap kali mereka mengaku rugi karena harus mengeluarkan biaya untuk mengurus  semua persyaratan agar menjadi transportasi umum yang legal. “Sementara, pengendara grab dan Uber kan menggunakan mobil pribadi. Bahkan, ketika kami perhatikan dari platnya tidak hanya berasal dari Jakarta, tetapi juga Tangerang, Tegal, Semarang dan Cirebon,” kata dia. Mewakili rekan-rekannya, Suwardi mengaku kecewa terhadap sikap pemerintah yang malah melanggar aturan yang mereka buat sendiri. Demonstrasi anarkis Dalam demonstrasi tersebut, Rappler menemukan satu kendaraan dengan jenis Toyota Avanza berwarna hitam yang dirusak oleh para demonstran. Menurut petugas polisi yang Rappler temui, mobil tersebut dirusak oleh para demonstran merupakan salah satu armada Grab yang tertangkap basah tengah beroperasi di depan Kementerian Koordinator Politik, Hukum dan Keamanan. Lalu, bagaimana respons dari perwakilan PPAD soal sikap anarkis ini? Suwardi mengatakan tidak bisa mencegah hal itu. “Karena di sini kan ada beberapa pihak yang ikut berdemonstrasi, sehingga tidak bisa menjamin 100 persen. Kalau kami dari sopir taksi pasti tertib. Walau ada suara sumbang dari kami, tetapi itu kan hanya sebatas suara,” papar Suwardi. Buka lapangan pekerjaan Sementara, salah satu pengemudi transportasi berbasis online, Go-Jek, Dadang Trisnandi mengatakan tidak mempermasalahkan jika para sopir kendaraan umum konvensional ingin berdemonstrasi. Dia hanya berharap demonstrasi tidak berlangsung anarkis.  “Saya memang menduga mereka berdemonstrasi karena mengeluh mengenai pendapatannya yang banyak berkurang setelah ada kehadiran Go-Jek dan Grab. Tapi, itu semua kini ada di tangan pemerintah,” ujar Dadang. Sebab, dia melanjutkan yang membuat aturan dan hukum adalah pemerintah. Dia turut menyebut justru dengan kehadiran Go-jek dan perusahaan startup sejenis membantu pemerintah menciptakan lapangan pekerjaan. “Saya kembalikan kepada masyarakat selaku pengguna, apakah mereka ingin Go-Jek ditutup atau tidak. Pemerintah atau pejabat yang berwenang terhadap masalah ini juga perlu membuat kajian apakah transportasi berbasis online memberikan banyak manfaat atau malah merugikan,” kata dia. Tak bayar pajak? Guberur DKI Jakarta, Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama yang ditemui pada Selasa, 15 Maret meminta pemilik atau pengelola layanan transportasi berbasis online untuk memenuhi kewajiban membayar pajak. Berdasarkan aturan, setiap pengusaha angkutan di Jakarta wajib membayar pajak yang nilainya sekitar 25 hingga 28 persen dari total pendapatannya setiap tahun. Pengusaha transportasi berbasis online juga tak luput dari pajak itu. “Transportasi online itu pasti lebih murah, karena kan tidak harus membayar pajak, bayar asuransi dan lain-lain. Sedangkan, angkutan umum konvensional dan taksi harus memenuhi kewajiban untuk membayar pajak tersebut,” ujar mantan Bupati Bangka Belitung itu. Sementara, salah satu pengemudi Grab Car bernama Bashari menepis jika pihaknya abai membayar pajak. “Bahkan nominal yang dipungut perusahaan itu berkisar Rp170 ribu-Rp180 ribu setiap minggunya. Itu dari satu pengemudi,” ujar Bashari ketika ditemui Rappler pada Senin, 14 Maret. Dia pun berkisah saat ini menjadi pengemudi Grab Car semakin kompetitif, karena jumlahnya yang semakin banyak “Sekarang, saya harus bekerja selama 15 jam sehari untuk bisa mencapai target penghasilan Rp3 juta per minggu. Jadi, kami turut merasakan kesulitan,” kata dia. Harus lebih kompetitif Pengamat transportasi dari Masyarakat Transportasi Indonesia (MTI), Dharmaningtyas, berpendapat senada dengan Ahok. Menurutnya, walaupun mengaku sebagai perusahaan teknologi, tetapi baik Grab dan Uber memberikan jasa layanan transportasi bagi publik. Di saat taksi-taksi reguler dikenai pajak, kir (pengujian kendaraan bermotor), dan dituntut memiliki pull. “Sementara, angkutan seperti Grab dan Uber kan tidak. Masalahnya kan di situ. Menguntungkan konsumen, tetapi bagi operator taksi pada umumnya merugikan. Apalagi bagi taksi reguler,” ujar Dharmaningtyas yang dihubungi Rappler melalui telepon pada Senin malam, 14 Maret. Lalu, apa yang sebaiknya dilakukan pemerintah? Dharmaningtyas menyarankan agar Presiden Joko Widodo mengingatkan kedua perusahaan itu agar tetap tunduk kepada UU No 22 tahun 2009 mengenai Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan. “Tetapi, jika Presiden ingin merevisi UU tersebut harus hati-hati. Sebab, penggunaan angkutan berbasis aplikasi online ini hanya ada di kota-kota besar. Sementara, UU kan berlaku secara nasional,” kata dia. Dia menyarankan sebaiknya aplikasi itu digunakan oleh operator taksi yang legal. “Tetapi, taksi konvensional juga harus berbenah diri, menurunkan tarif agar lebih bisa kompetitif. Alasan publik menggunakan taksi Uber dan Grab kan karena tarifnya lebih murah. Pengelola taksi reguler harus mencari jawaban bagaimana bisa menerapkan tarif yang kompetitif,” papar dia. – Rappler.com BACA JUGA:  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/125786-kemenhub-minta-kemkominfo-blokir-grab-uber/","title":"Kemenhub minta Kemkominfo blokir aplikasi transportasi online","date":"Mar 14, 2016 7:26 PM PHT","snippet":"Kementerian Perhubungan menilai perusahaan GRAB dan Uber telah melanggar aturan dan angkutan ilegal.","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – (UPDATED) Kementerian Perhubungan meminta Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika memblokir aplikasi transportasi berbasis internet, khususnya GRABTAXI dan Uber. Menurut Kemenhub, baik GRABTAXI maupun Uber telah melanggar delapan ketentuan beroperasi di Jakarta. Menurut dokumen yang diperoleh Rappler pada Senin, 14 Maret, GRABTAXI dan Uber dianggap melanggar tiga aturan yaitu UU Nomor 22 tahun 2009 tentang Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan, UU Nomor 25 tahun 2007 mengenai penanaman modal yang menyatakan penanaman modal asing wajib dalam bentuk perseroan terbatas berdasarkan hukum Indonesia serta Surat Keputusan Kepala BKPM Nomor 22 tahun 2001 yang menyebut UBER sebagai kantor perwakilan Indonesia tidak diperkenankan melakukan kegiatan komersial.    Dalam dokumen tersebut, Kemenhub menyebut keberadaan kedua perusahaan itu telah menimbulkan keresahan dan konflik di kalangan pengusaha angkutan resmi dan pengemudi taksi resmi serta meyuburkan praktek angkutan liar (ilegal). Hal lain, keberadaan dua perusahaan itu turut membuat angkutan umum semakin tidak diminati. Dengan mempertimbangkan semua aturan itu, maka dalam surat tersebut Kemenhub mendorong dua hal: 1. Kemkominfo segera memblokir situs aplikasi milik GRABTAXI dan UBER serta melarang seluruh aplikasi sejenis. 2. Tidak bekerjasama dengan perusahaan angkutan umum lain yang tidak mempunyai izin resmi Lalu, apa komentar Kemenhub mengenai surat tersebut? Kepala Pusat Komunikasi Kemenhub, JA Barata membenarkan surat yang beredar di dunia maya tersebut. “Surat itu memang sudah ada dan baru dikirim ke Kemkominfo pagi tadi. Yang melaksanakan pemblokiran nanti juga Kemkominfo,” ujar JA Barata ketika dihubungi Rappler melalui telepon pada Senin, 14 Maret. Lalu, apa bedanya kebijakan Kemenhub saat ini dengan yang dikeluarkan Menhub Ignasius Jonan pada 17 Desember 2015? “Kalau kebijakan saat ini hanya tertuju kepada Taksi Uber dan Grab Car karena perusahaan angkutan ini dianggap melakukan pelanggaran terhadap UU yang berlaku, karena di dalam UU itu diatur syarat untuk mendirikan perusahaan taksi,” kata Barata. Sementara, yang dituntut oleh Kemenhub dalam kebijakan 17 Desember tahun lalu, menyasar angkutan aplikasi online gojek dan grab bike. Barata menegaskan tidak ada aturan khusus mengenai angkutan transportasi umum sepeda motor. Pada 17 Desember 2015, Kementerian Perhubungan juga melarang Gojek dan Grabike beroperasi tetapi larangan itu dicabut sehari sesudah diumumkan. Pencabutan kebijakan dilakukan usai Presiden Joko Widodo memanggil Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan ke Istana Negara.  Kemenhub, kata Barata, menyerahkan sepenuhnya keputusan akhir pemblokiran aplikasi online kepada Kemkominfo. Regulasi tak dipegang Kemkominfo Sementara, Menteri Komunikasi dan Informatika, Rudiantara mengatakan tak akan menutup transportasi berbasis online. Rudiantara bahkan berpikir, jika memang aplikasi tersebut dinikmati oleh masyarakat maka sepatutnya dicarikan solusi alternatif. “Dari sisi Kemkominfo, kami tidak relevan mengatur mengenai regulasi. Hal itu seharusnya ditangani oleh Kemenhub, dishub daerah dan pemda,” ujar Rudi ketika ditemui di kompleks DPR Senayan pada Senin, 14 Maret. Justru dia mengatakan tidak semua aplikasi harus mengajukan perizinan. Kecuali jika startup di bidang e-commerce itu memberikan pelayanan kepada publik, mereka membutuhkan akreditasi, tapi itu semua diserahkan ke industri. Kemkominfo justru ingin menerapkan light touch regulation, sehingga jika membutuhkan izin, hanya keluar dari satu pintu. “Kalau izin cukup dari dirjen ya maka dari dirjen saja. Nanti, dirjennya melapor ke saya,” kata Rudi. Dia bahkan mengkritik jika segala sesuatu membutuhkan perizinan dan diurus oleh pemerintah, maka sektor tersebut tidak akan kompetitif. “Itu kan idenya anak muda. Untuk apa start up minta izin? Ketika memulai kan belum tentu jadi bisnis, jadi tinggal lapor saja ke Kemkominfo,” tuturnya.  Kendati begitu, Rudi menyebut akan terus berkoordinasi dengan Ignasius terkait dengan kebijakan ini. Beri waktu 15 hari Sementara itu, Ketua Paguyuban Pengemudi Angkutan Darat (PPAD), Cecep Handoko yang ditemui di kantor Sekretaris Negara mengatakan mereka dan pemerintah sudah mencapai kesepakatan. PPAD memberikan waktu 15 hari kepada pemerintah untuk mengeluarkan kebijakan agar GRABTAXI dan Uber mematuhi aturan yang ada. “Iya, permasalahannya ini kan di regulasi. Kami merupakan pengendara mobil pelat kuning itu dibebani berbagai macam aturan hingga ke penetapan ongkos. Maka, jika mau setara, mari dibuat Peraturan Presiden atau Instruksi Presiden yang tidak perlu legislasi hingga nanti ada revisi terhadap UU Lalu Lintas tahun 2009,” kata Cecep. PPAD menegaskan mereka akan terus mendesak Kemkominfo untuk segera mengambil tindakan tegas agar segera menerapkan rekomendasi dari Kemenhub. “Maaf, bukan bermaksud sombong, tetapi kami beri waktu 15 hari. Kalau enggak ada tindak lanjut, maka kami akan demo lagi. Sebab, ini sudah menjadi kegelisahan kawan-kawan pengemudi,” tutur Cecep. – Rappler.com BACA JUGA:"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/116306-pemerintah-resmi-melarang-ojek-taksi-online/","title":"Pemerintah resmi melarang ojek dan taksi online","date":"Dec 17, 2015 11:53 PM PHT","snippet":"\"Ketentuan angkutan umum adalah harus minimal beroda tiga, berbadan hukum dan memiliki izin penyelenggaraan angkutan umum.\"","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia—Kementerian Perhubungan melarang ojek dan taksi online beroperasi karena dinilai tidak memenuhi ketentuan sebagai angkutan umum.

We urge passengers to rate our drivers and give proper feedback in our app so that we may be able to take corrective actions, if any,' says Grab in a statement","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Amid passengers’ complaints of “abusive and choosy” drivers, GrabPH on Thursday, September 10, issued an apology saying the company is already looking at ways to improve its services. “GrabTaxi has always been committed to providing a better option for public transportation. We would like to apologize to commuters as not everyone was able to get a ride home via our service during the downpour last Tuesday, 8 September 2015,” Grab said in its Facebook page.  Passengers’ complaints on Grab were amplified Tuesday when thousands of passengers were forced to walk home due to traffic bottlenecks caused by torrential rains.  Former Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) “traffic czar” Yves Gonzalez called Grab’s attention saying that while GrabTaxi markets itself as an alternative from abusive taxi drivers, the app instead is being used by drivers to exploit commuters. (READ: Are Grab drivers abusing commuters’ rights?) “Many of our drivers were affected and got stranded, like the rest of Metro Manila, and were not able to accept bookings as they were caught in the gridlock. The flooded road conditions also meant that they would have risked passenger safety and their cars breaking down,” Grab explained.  Acknowledging that there’s still room to “improve our passengers’ experience,” Grab said it will take the following steps to increase the number of bookings accepted. GrabTaxi is a mobile application, founded in Malaysia in 2011, that allows users to book taxis. GrabCar is the app’s alternative form of service which uses cars through licensed partners, in case there are no available taxis during rush hour. ‘Institutionalizing bribery’ One of the causes of passengers’ frustration with the app is its optional “tip” feature, where drivers, according to netizens, wait for big tips before accepting passengers.  “The system has made a mockery of the traditional definition of a tip, which is something given after a job or service is well rendered. A tip in the current system is plainly a bribe to the driver for him to accept a trip,” Gonzalez earlier told Rappler. Grab said the purpose of fixed pricing model is to make sure passengers won’t be given unreasonable fares due to unforeseen circumstances on the road.  “In the event that these happen, the tip function allows us to balance out high demand during low supply situations without forcing passengers to pay a surge. There have been varying viewpoints on the value of this feature, and we commit to reviewing it to better suit the market,” Grab said. On complaints about abusive drivers, Grab said: “We will not hesitate to investigate and deregister errant drivers. We urge passengers to rate our drivers and give proper feedback in our app so that we may be able to take corrective actions, if any.” The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has already asked Grab to explain complaints against its choosy drivers.

Myles Delfin, a designer and entrepreneur, wrote: Every single day, the problem of the commuting public is that taxis, jeepneys, and buses are so badly regulated that commuters are left at the mercy of whoever is behind the wheel, and now the LTFRB is going after the only reliable form of transportation available to the Filipino? I think, the people who lead this agency should try standing in line at any of the taxi stands in a shopping mall on a payday Friday – and every day thereafter, just to let them feel what it’s like to be on the receiving end of nonsense. They’re forgetting that it’s not only about the law, their job, if they decide to take it seriously, is to make sure that the Filipino gets the service they deserve. The reality of the situation is that it is time for public transportation to evolve because it doesn’t work and the government agency tasked to make it work has consistently failed. Independent innovators like Uber and GrabTaxi wouldn’t have any business if public transport actually worked, and the LTFRB has had decades to find a solution and make it work, and now they want us to entrust our safety, peace of mind, and time to an idea that is basically a knock-off of the service they’re trying to pin down. For what reason? The law? Regular taxi drivers mock the law every minute of the day whenever they disregard the regulations that are in place to make sure the riding public aren’t abused or taken advantage of, everybody knows this from experience, and where is the official concern there? Taxi drivers at the airport virtually try to rob people blind whenever they step out of the arrival terminal, isn’t that about the law too? Jeepneys cause traffic whenever they pick up and unload passengers at all the wrong places, why isn’t that a priority? Others shared some of their experiences on the road. Judy Marie Santiago, a communications officer, said: One time, I can’t find a cab on Grabtaxi and got desperate. Buses are jampacked, MRT queues are hopeless. I had to give a tip of 100 just to get one.  Hep Benitez, an author and teacher, commented: I always have to pay an additional 50 pesos or 100 pesos on top of the metered bill just to get a taxi. Edna Ledesma-Javier complained about the flagdown rate: Isn’t it that the flag down was already reduced to Php30? The first week it was announced all the taxis had this placard in front that says flag down is less than 10 pesos. Now, they do not have it. And when you ask for it they feigned innocence. Jordan Zamoranos shared his picture of a taxi driver who allegedly refused to take him from Ortigas to Glorietta.  Kaizel Sarabia said: Everytime we went to the Malate area and ride a cab from there to my house, we always encounter cab drivers like that. Mostly, they demand 100 percent increase in fare. James Habitan shared his experience:  The taxi driver asked for a deposit for 100 pesos so he could get me to ATC faster. Immediately, I know I was going to get ripped off so I threatened to leave the taxi to find myself a new one unless he charges me by the meter. Sure enough, as soon as I opened the door, the driver gave in to my conditions and turned his meter on. We got to ATC right away and I was only charged just under Php70.00. Dheejhae Flores urged LTFRB to be responsive on social media: Sana may Facebook Page din ang LTFRB na sumasagot gaya ng MMDA. May Twitter nga sila, never naman sumasagot.” Redi Briones reported many times to the LTO hotline after a UV express driver shouted at him for not having the exact fare. He wonders what happened to those cases with special codes. Briones also suggested that public utility vehicle drivers should undergo customer relations training, and that holding a professional driver’s license should not be the sole requirement for the job. “We always prefer alternatives over real solutions” A few netizens offered their own recommendations. {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>I think the priority should be on the BRTs &amp; not on premium taxis.

I’d say it’s a win-win. Taxis get the bookings, plus they get to pick the passengers they want (since they do this anyway).  Albert Paul Navarro made this proposal: There should be an incentive in place to encourage carpools coming from LTO because it only does not lessen the cars on the road but it lessens carbon emissions as well. Taxis are threatened by Grab and Uber because of the quality of service those brands provide so it’s high time taxis should also reinvent the wheel. Why would the commuting public go for Uber and Grab if their services are as good as these brands? Quality of the vehicle is also in question. Uber and Grab utilize private cars that are well maintained and taken care of by the owners while Taxis are the exact opposite,” observed  Raymond Lam Ko, on the other hand, suggested: Fix the transportation system so people wouldn’t rely on taxis and uber like app services. Fix and expand the train system, fix or update the bus system, fix the taxi drivers and units, update jeepneys to non smoke belching if not to phase them out, tricycles can be maintained for small streets only or in subdivisions. But IMHO, if trains are fixed, traffic will lessen because more people will take the train rather than taxi. This was echoed by Gene Angelo Ferrer, National Coordinator of Aksyon Klima.

The joy I find in driving is not one many here can relate to. After all, who wants to drive in the clogged, polluted, chaotic and sometimes anarchic, streets of Metro Manila? Well after 3 weeks of driving again, I still do. Of course, when I’m in a hurry – I find myself shouting at the top of my lungs, to the thousands of drivers who can’t hear me, to “get the f… out of my way!” In hopes that if there is a God of the road, that He would part the way for me. (Unfortunately, I know I’m not Moses, and I can’t part the Red Sea. Bummer.) But despite the chaos, I still feel the most clear, alert, and alive behind the wheel. It might be the American side of me. I was born and raised in a country where you can drive for hours and hours and the road seems to never end. When I get behind the wheel, I feel like I am in charge of my own destiny – and not at the mercy of a cab, bus, FX or any other driver. When I am driving, I am in charge. And in life, that’s where I want to remain: in charge. In times of trouble, uncertainty and confusion, I always know what to do: grab my car keys, rev up the engine, and just drive. It doesn’t matter where, it doesn’t matter for how long. When troubled, I didn’t really want to go anywhere, but at the same time, I wanted to go somewhere. It is behind the wheel that hazy thoughts become clearer, that paralyzing decisions I’ve been putting off are made, and directions found. And after two years of living in Manila, a good drive is just what I needed to make sense of life. About a week ago, I felt lost, confused and was ready to surrender. Thankfully, I have a car to drive now – so what did I do? You guessed it, I got behind the wheel, rolled the windows down, breathed in the fresh countryside air, and just drove. I went from Rizal to Batangas, and while I was driving, the past two years went flashing through my mind. The sacrifices I’ve made to be here, to work for (what was then) a small start-up company to now one of the top 3 news sites in the Philippines. Has working here for much less than I’m used to been worth it? The friends, family and love I sacrificed – was it worth it? Have the things I’ve done in the past two years meant anything to anyone? The answers came clear as day: Yes, yes and yes. First, my life’s meaning is not attached to my bank account. The sacrifices have been rewarded with even greater experiences that most people can only dream of or watch in movies. To the overseas Pinoys we’ve been able to give voice to, especially the migrant worker communities – our work does mean something. There have been many mornings where I’ve found it tough to believe in myself, and worry that I’ve bitten off more than I can chew. But it is the people I have a chance to work with every day who keep me going and believing that we are on to something big. And that I need to stop whining, suck it up and keep moving forward. What is that something? I don’t know yet. But just like driving, the point isn’t always about being certain about where you are going. It is about not being stuck because you don’t know where you are going. Just keep moving even if you are uncertain, be patient, and pay attention to the signs around you, because you will get to your destination, eventually. In the meantime, just enjoy the ride. – Rappler.com  Ryan Macasero is Rappler’s #BalikBayan Editor."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/91987-pacquiao-mayweather-metro-manila-crime/","title":"No major crime in Metro Manila during Pacquiao fight","date":"May 3, 2015 5:36 PM PHT","snippet":"But 2 men are shot dead in separate incidents in Batangas and Cagayan de Oro, a person is stabbed in Samar, and another person is hit by a stray bullet in Laguna","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The “tradition” continues. The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Sunday, May 3, reported “no major untoward incidents” in the National Capital Region during the highly-anticipated match between Filipino boxing champion Manny Pacquiao and American Floyd Mayweather Jr. “Police units in Metro Manila reported no major untoward incident between 9am and 3pm today during the Pacquiao-Mayweather fight,” the PNP said in a statement released around 4:30 pm, hours after the fight, held in Las Vegas, USA, ended. Pacquiao lost to Mayweather in a unanimous decision. Major streets in Metro Manila were devoid of traffic in the hours leading up to the fight – a rare sight in the congested Philippine capital. But other parts of the Philippines weren’t as peaceful.  In Tanauan city, Batangas, an unidentified gunman killed a certain Ronnel Villarosa of barangay (village) Pantay Bata at around 10:45 am. In Sta Cruz, Laguna, Julia Isagon Dela Peña was hit by a stray bullet by an unidentified man. Dela Peña has since been brought to the hospital. At around 11:50 am, two unidentified suspects tried to grab the car keys of Nestor Corrales in Cagayan de Oro City but he resisted. The armed men then shot Corrales dead. In Catbalogan city, Samar, Alejandro Catienza, a fish vendor was stabbed and later brought to the hospital. Zero crime rate tradition Pacquiao matches typically result in a low to zero crime rate in most parts of the country, with many Filipinos crowding houses, theaters, restaurants, barangay halls, and other public areas to watch the fight. At the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame, it was no different. Some 1,400 police personnel and their families watched the fight live inside the Multipurpose Center, through screening sponsored by ABS-CBN, LG Electronics, and the Public Safety Savings and Loan Association, Inc. PNP spokesman Senior Superintendent Bartolome Tobias said the 150,000-strong police force “congratulates [Pacquiao] for bringing pride to the country by putting up a great fight against the undefeated [Mayweather].” The Multipurpose center, police personnel – senior officers, young officers, enlisted personnel, and non-uniformed personnel, and their families – gathered to cheer for the “People Champ,” gasping with every punch Pacquiao made and received. The crowd only turned a little more sober towards the end of the fight, as it became clear that Mayweather was edging out Pacquiao. “He fought a good fight. We all wish him well. He is still our People’s Champ despite the loss. At any rate, we respect the outcome of the fight. And look forward to another showdown between the two great boxing legends,” added Tobias. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/78978-dec-25-2014-renewable-energy-pope-francis-message-china-wenzhou-christmas-ban/","title":"Renewable energy, Pope message, China Christmas ban | The wRap","date":"Dec 25, 2014 7:02 PM PHT","snippet":"A petition to the Supreme Court: stop charging for renewable energy.

The four-year-old male, who survived with nothing more than a torn nail, was struck by the vehicle near Maryborough in Queensland state on Friday, July 24. The Australia Zoo wildlife hospital said it latched onto the bottom of the car as it sped away, with the family inside not knowing they had a marsupial on board. It was only when they stopped in Gympie after a high-speed freeway drive that they noticed it, and called the hospital for help. The maximum speed on the freeway is 110 kilometers per hour. Australia Zoo vet Claude Lacasse said it was amazing the koala, named Timberwolf by the rescuers who brought him in, was in such great health. “It is absolutely amazing that he has such minor injuries and he survived,” Lacasse said. “It is a truly remarkable story, he is a very lucky koala.” Timberwolf was given pain killers for the torn nail and is recovering in a tree at the zoo north of Brisbane as vets work out exactly where he grabbed hold of the car so they can return him to the wild. Australia Zoo, set up by television personality and conservationist Steve “Crocodile Hunter” Irwin, treats an average of 70 koalas every month. Approximately 70% of its patients are victims of car accidents or domestic pet attacks. Thought to number in excess of 10 million before British settlers arrived in 1788, there are now believed to be as few as 43,000 koalas left in the wild, though their existence high in the treetops makes them difficult to count. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/59367-grabcar-uber-apple-beats-music-lg-g3/","title":"GrabCar vs Uber (TechRap)","date":"Jun 1, 2014 10:30 AM PHT","snippet":"Apple buys Beats Music for $3B, LG launches the G3, and a battle between personal chauffeur services - GrabCar vs Uber","body":"MANILA, Philippines – This week on TechRap, Apple buys Beats Music for 3 billion dollars.
