Bobby Coronel, founder of drivers’ group TopSpeed, said it was high time that Mr. Duterte stepped in to address the issues faced by their sector, saying thousands of drivers affected by the moratorium just want “to work and earn a decent living for their families.”  “Tatay Digong, we are calling on you to help us. We fully support your programs. We only want to have a good and proper job,” Coronel said in a press briefing in Quezon City. Coronel and several allied groups went to the Department of Transportation to submit a written appeal, which they said bore the signaturesof 122,000 passengers and drivers, mostly from transport network company (TNC) Grab.  Tim Orbos, the undersecretary for road transport, assured the groups they would “find ways to solve this impasse,” but said they should also “understand [the government’s] point of view.” “We do not want them to stop their operations. We have to do our task as government. We understand that there’s a problem [in our mass transport systems]. Definitely, we would not do something that would further inconvenience the public,” he said.  In July last year, the LTFRB issued the moratorium as it cited the need to look into various concerns arising from the rapid acceptance of app-based transport services, such as surge pricing, passenger security and accountability of the drivers. Earlier this month, the LTFRB announced it would start apprehending Grab and Uber drivers whom the TNCs allowed to operate without a provisional authority (PA) or certificates of public convenience (CPCs). The crackdown, which could affect more than 40,000 drivers, was supposed to take effect on July 26 but was put on hold on Thursday after Grab and Uber filed motions for reconsideration. At present, just about 3,700 drivers have been issued PAs and CPCs. The LTFRB earlier said it would fast-track the approval of around 11,000 applications. Meanwhile, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada yesterday disclosed that the original accreditation documents of Uber and Grab could not be found when she and other appointees of the Duterte administration took over the board last year.  “We tried to locate the accreditation folders of both Uber and Grab. However, after searching the office of the executive director and the chair, they were nowhere to be found,” Lizada said. But the matter was a nonissue for former board member Ariel Inton.“It is very easy to get a copy, assuming it was lost,” Inton said. “If it was lost in the executive director’s office, there are other copies [in other offices].” Inton added that all LTFRB documents were “properly turned over” by former chair Winston Ginez to his successor, Martin Delgra III. Grab’s accreditation as a TNC expired earlier this month while that of Uber will expire next month. Lizada explained that the loss of the accreditation papers would have no effect on the renewal of their accreditation. Both TNCs have already submitted their petitions for renewal."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919650/number-of-uber-grab-vehicles-shocks-ltfrb","title":"Number of Uber, Grab vehicles shocks LTFRB","date":"01:11 PM August 02, 2017","snippet":"Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Martin Delgra III on Wednesday said he is “shocked” to learn of the number of Uber and Grab vehicles plying the roads of Metro Manila which the transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) companies earlier did not reveal.","body":"Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Martin Delgra III on Wednesday said he is “shocked” to learn of the number of Uber and Grab vehicles plying the roads of Metro Manila which the transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) companies earlier did not reveal. During a transportation committee hearing at the House of Representatives, Delgra expressed shock at the numbers provided by Uber and Grab on the number of ride-hailing and -sharing vehicles operating in Manila.  Asked by lawmakers on the number of vehicles operating under Uber, Uber Philippines government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said there are 66,000 Uber cars which had travelled at least one trip for one year. Of the 66,000 Uber vehicles, 2,500 have provisional authority from the LTFRB, while there are 1,000 with pending extension of this authority.  READ: ‘Defiant’ Uber probed; execs air lament Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu for his part said of the 52,398 Grab cars, only 3,000 to 4000 have provisional authority from the LTFRB.  Delgra lamented that Uber and Grab during a previous hearing with the LTFRB said each of these companies only have 28,000 vehicles plying Metro Manila streets. “During the July hearing, they have about 28,000 more or less each. And today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked,” Delgra said. “The number we heard today… These are the data we’ve been trying to get since last year, because we need to understand precisely the issue of accountability,” he added. READ: DOTr: Grab, Uber must follow rules Uber’s public policy director Damian Kassabgi for his part said as much as 60 percent of Uber drivers do not go full time, and that only less than 10,000 vehicles drive for the ride-sharing services at any point.  He said the sheer number of registered Uber vehicles in Manila does not mean it is equivalent to one ride-sharing car per one taxi, belying criticisms that the deluge of transportation network service vehicles worsened the traffic in the metropolis. “We seem to be getting stuck to the numbers, this and that. I want to make it clear, that one taxi is not equivalent to one ride sharing car… What’s relevant is how many cars are at any one point,” Kassabgi said. He added that Uber only deploys enough number of vehicles to meet the riders’ demand. “60 percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full time drivers. Many drive for less than 10 hours a week. One taxi car is equivalent to one ride sharing car is simply not true.. It’s important not to get stuck on the numbers here,” he added. Cu added that Grab only deploys enough vehicles to meet the demand numbering around five percent. “As of now the numbers we accredited, they don’t ply the roads on an hourly basis…. If we don’t grow supply by three percent a week, then there would be passengers who would not get a ride,” Cu said.

The LTFRB ordered Uber to pay the huge fine instead after lifting its one-month suspension, imposed on Aug. 14, that sparked public outrage and forced 36,367 vehicles off the streets.  “We’re working hard to meet the conditions for the lifting of the suspension and hope to resume operations as soon as possible,” said Cat Avelino, Uber’s head of communications, in a statement. On its Twitter account, Uber said it hoped to resume service  “this coming week.”  The transport agency said late on Friday that it would grant Uber’s petition to resume operations in exchange for the P190-million fine — much stiffer than Uber’s P10-million offer. It also required the company to pay about P20 million a day in financial assistance to its drivers for lost earnings.  Sen. Grace Poe welcomed the lifting of Uber’s suspension but nevertheless expressed disappointment at the timing of the decision. Poe, who chairs the Senate committee on public services, pointed out that Uber would be unable to comply with the LTFRB order at once because the banks are closed on weekends. The LTFRB handed down its ruling right before the start of a three-day weekend, thus depriving Uber the chance to immediately resume service. “I am quite disappointed that the LTFRB decision was issued late Friday afternoon, effectively taking out any opportunity for Uber to pay the penalties,” Poe said in a statement. “It is frustrating to think that we have a long weekend ahead of us and people will have to suffer the inconvenience of having limited transportation choices in going around Metro [Manila] with their families,” she added.  Because the country is commemorating National Heroes Day tomorrow, the earliest that Uber can only comply with the board’s order is on Tuesday. In its eight-page order, the LTFRB said that Uber’s fine was “commensurate to the penalty of suspension.” It added that based on the data submitted by Uber, the company earned between P7 million and P10 million daily from about 150,000 trips. “[The P190-million fine] is arrived at by taking into consideration the number of days that respondent should be suspended in relation to the daily average income,” the order read. Uber was suspended for defying an LTFRB moratorium on the acceptance of new drivers as the agency studied how to regulate the growing ride-sharing industry. Uber’s rival Grab followed the directive. After filing a motion for reconsideration on Aug. 15, Uber resumed operations, only to stop on the same day when the LTFRB board denied its petition. “The online ride-sharing services of the respondent (Uber) will be restored when it has paid the amount of fine and the said financial assistance [to Uber drivers] remitted,” the board resolution said. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that Uber should continue to provide assistance to its drivers until it had settled the fine. She added that for Uber to resume operations, it should provide proof of compliance from its bank, indicating that the drivers had indeed received the amount due them. The board explained that Uber’s P190-million fine is only about a third of what it would have spent if it fully served its suspension. Uber would have also shelled out about P597 million in financial aid to its drivers for a month. But Poe said the LTFRB could have offered relief to a lot more people had it given Uber the chance to comply with the ruling at once. “If the LTFRB had allowed Uber to operate right away, then this could have served as a great relief to our people, most of whom rely on TNVS (transport network vehicle service) due to the comfort, reliability and safety they provide,” she said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The P190-million penalty, she also said, “should be enough to make Uber rethink its actions and reevaluate its strategy in testing the extent of government regulations.” Commuters had voiced out their disappointment in the suspension of Uber, saying services like these offered a convenient alternative, especially with problems with irascible and choosy taxi drivers who overcharged fares. Uber said this month it was accepting new applications for vehicles but was not processing them pending its discussions with the LTFRB. It also urged the government to simplify the accreditation process, with a representative telling Poe’s committee: “We cannot impose 1900s regulations on today’s technological innovations.” —With a report from AFP"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/186170/uber-technologies-expanding-in-ph","title":"Uber Technologies expanding in PH","date":"05:41 AM February 06, 2015","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines–San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, operator of a wildly popular smartphone application that connects drivers and passengers,  is keen on expanding its presence in the Philippines with the upcoming release of landmark rules in the region.","body":"MANILA, Philippines–San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, operator of a wildly popular smartphone application that connects drivers and passengers,  is keen on expanding its presence in the Philippines with the upcoming release of landmark rules in the region. But certain kinks, like the proposed  regulation of Uber’s pricing scheme, needs further “reconsideration,” Michael Brown, Uber regional general manager, said in a rare interview in Manila this week.  Brown said Uber welcomed the release of the new guidelines, which has yet to receive the final approval of Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya, as a way to move forward following a brief run-in with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board in late 2014. He noted that Uber, whose growth has skyrocketed globally since it started in 2009 and is now valued at more than $40 billion, agreed with most of the new guidelines, which would require drivers here to get government permits apart from more stringent safety measures like criminal background checks.  “The Philippines would be the first jurisdiction in Asia to have this kind of regulation,” Brown said. The new rules  will likewise lend added legitimacy to Uber’s domestic business. Uber, which owns no cars and provides only the platform, has been recording fast growth since it officially began in Metro Manila in February 2014, Brown said.  It makes money by taking a cut out of the fare, usually 20 percent. Brown declined to give figures specific to the Philippines but said the Uber X product, for more compact vehicles, offers cheaper fares compared to standard taxis. The company expects to lure “tens of thousands” of  Filipino drivers over the next few years. He said plans to expand outside Metro Manila were also in the cards.  As noted, a thorny issue here is related to the regulation of Uber’s pricing scheme, which can fluctuate depending on the volume of vehicles on the road. For example, prices can fall below regular  taxi rates during lean hours but they also climb significantly higher during “rush hours.” “We have made transportation less expensive for people and drivers are making more money than they have ever made. What we are advocating is that the government here should allow us to do what we do well,” Brown said. “We have expressed a desire for them [LTFRB] to rethink that aspect of the regulation,” said Brown, adding that their pricing model is regulated nowhere else in the world. Right now, the LTFRB is keen on regulating fares—its mandate under the law, LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez said in a separate interview. He said the draft had been submitted to Abaya and further meetings were likely required. “We know the economics of this [ business] and we will not be unreasonable. But we want to have the final say. We don’t want prices to be abused,” Ginez said.  He said he was hoping to release the final rules within the month."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/801057/uber-summoned-driver-accused-of-rape","title":"Uber summoned; driver accused of rape","date":"05:03 AM July 30, 2016","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has called officials of Uber System Inc. to a hearing in connection with a rape complaint filed by a passenger against an Uber car driver in Quezon City.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has called officials of Uber System Inc. to a hearing in connection with a rape complaint filed by a passenger against an Uber car driver in Quezon City. LTFRB issued a show cause order to the transport network company (TNC) on Friday,  asking the firm to disclose details about the driver to help the complainant. Board member Ariel Inton said the agency had received a report that a 22-year-old woman was sexually abused on Wednesday afternoon by an Uber driver who picked her up at Camp Aguinaldo.  According to a report filed in the Quezon City Police District, the driver of a red Toyota Vios (ARA 3101), identified as Xstian Karlou John Marie, suddenly embraced the victim and told her to hold his genitals while they were passing through Katipunan Avenue, near UP Town Center,  around 2:30 p.m. As the victim tried to break free from the suspect, he allegedly pulled her hair to force her to perform oral sex, but she managed to escape.  The LTFRB asked Uber officials to appear in a hearing on Aug. 10. Citing the board’s “frustrations,” Inton noted that Uber “doesn’t give the real identity of their ‘peers’ or driver/operator” as it invokes its privacy policy. “It has come to our attention that Uber does not disclose the name of the driver or any of its details to their passenger. When a crime is committed, it would be very hard for the victim to file a case because no detail with regard to the perpetrator is provided,” Inton said in a statement. LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra also ordered Uber to disclose the driver’s identity and other personal details, stressing that “it is a franchise requirement.” In a statement issued Friday afternoon, Uber said it had already removed the driver—  whom it did not name—from its platform and gotten in touch with authorities involved in the investigation. “First and foremost our thoughts are with the rider and her family. We immediately removed the driver from the Uber platform when we learned of the reported incident and are cooperating fully with law enforcement in their ongoing investigation and stand ready to assist them in every way we can,” the company said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919875/think-tank-scrap-limit-on-uber-grab","title":"Think tank: Scrap limit on Uber, Grab","date":"05:25 AM August 03, 2017","snippet":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab.","body":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab. FEF — an advocacy group for good economic governance and market-friendly reforms — said Uber, Grab, Easy Taxi, Wunder carpool, Angkas and similar ride-sharing services were doing the riding public a service that regular public utility vehicles had been unable to provide.  The benefits come from on-demand service, ability to provide feedback and choice despite the lack of visible markings, as well as safety and peace of mind due to thorough screening and training provided by the ride-sharing services and feedback from the riding public, the group said in a statement on Wednesday. FEF said it was therefore “untimely and inappropriate” for the LTRFB to curtail the service by capping the number of permits issued to the drivers of these ride-sharing services.  It stressed: “Limiting the number of vehicles allowed to do ride-sharing is not only anticompetitive, but it also forces the riding public to use their own cars on the road to add to the traffic congestion and also compels them to bear with the abuses perpetuated by regulated private utility vehicles, such as taxis.” FEF is chaired by former Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, with Romy Bernardo as vice chair and Calixto Chikiamco as president. Its senior advisers are former Prime Minister and Finance Minister Cesar Virata and UP Economics Professor Emeritus and former Economic Planning Minister Gerardo Sicat.  Market forces, public good Board members include Anthony Abad, Art Corpuz, Eduardo Gana, Felipe Medalla, Vaugh Montes, Simon Paterno, Perry Pe and Gloria Tan-Climaco. The group added that recent discussions on minimum working hours for drivers and other comments demonizing surge pricing should be reconsidered by looking at this from the perspective of how market forces could serve the public good. Surge pricing during peak hours, it said, encourages drivers to make themselves available when they are needed most. From the point of view of riders, it encourages them to plan their trips to avoid the busy, more expensive periods. “Surge pricing, therefore, creates behavior that self-corrects fares to lower levels.  In contrast, minimum working hours only fill the street with additional cars when less needed, adding to traffic congestion, wasting fuel and oversupply,” FEF said.  The group said there’s a clear need to update and modernize the Public Service Act to account for this wave of technology-enabled transport services with the objective of serving and protecting the public. The regulators must incorporate the principles of technology and the market to improve public transport services in cities around the country, FEF said. In addition, FEF said Congress should review Executive Order 202, which created the LTFRB, to clarify the mandate and regulatory powers of the agency “in light of new technology and the need of the public for safe, affordable, and convenient public transport services.” ‘Shocked’ at House hearing The group issued the statement three weeks after the LTFRB imposed a P5-million fine each on Uber and Grab for violating its year-old moratorium on the acceptance of new partner drivers. When it ordered the ban in July 2016, the board said it had to review guidelines concerning surge pricing, passenger security and drivers’ accountability, among others. In a House committee hearing on Wednesday, the two TNCs disclosed the current size of their driver memberships and vehicle accreditations—figures that “shocked” LTFRB chair Martin Delgra. Uber government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said the company had 66,000 partners “who have taken at least one trip in the past year.” Of this number, only 2,500 drivers have provisional authority to operate while another 1,000 have pending motions for extension, he said. Meanwhile, Grab country head Brian Cu said the company had 52,398 accredited vehicles, of which 3,000 to 4,000 had provisional authority to operate. Delgra said the huge figures came as a shock to him and the agency. “During the July hearing (at the LTFRB),” he recalled, “they said they have 28,000 more or less each. Today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked.” “It is good you were able to solicit the numbers directly from them,” Delgra told the House transportation committee. “These are the data we have been trying to get since last year to exact accountability as well as address the issue of price surging.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But Uber’s public policy director Damian Kassabgi said policymakers should not put too much weight on the number of drivers, as only a small proportion of them actually plied the road at any given time. “Sixty percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full-time drivers. Many drive for less than 10 hours a week. [To say that] one taxi car is equivalent to one ride-sharing car is simply not true,” he said. “It’s important not to get stuck on the numbers here.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/905332/embattled-uber-ceo-kalanick-to-take-leave-of-absence","title":"Embattled Uber CEO Kalanick to take leave of absence","date":"09:43 AM June 14, 2017","snippet":"Uber said Tuesday its chief executive Travis Kalanick would take an indefinite leave of absence as it unveiled steps aimed at restoring confidence in the scandal-plagued ridesharing giant.","body":"Uber said Tuesday its chief executive Travis Kalanick would take an indefinite leave of absence as it unveiled steps aimed at restoring confidence in the scandal-plagued ridesharing giant. The pioneering company has been facing pressure to rein in a no-holds-barred management style led by Kalanick and to reform its workplace culture, which has sparked charges of harassment and discrimination.  “If we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve,” the 40-year-old Kalanick said in an email to Uber employees. Kalanick said one of the reasons for his stepping aside was the recent death of his mother, explaining he needs time off “to reflect, to work on myself and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team.”  Kalanick said he would remain available as needed during his absence for “the most strategic decisions.” Uber simultaneously released a 13-page document calling for major reforms at the company based on a probe led by former US attorney general Eric Holder, who investigated allegations of misconduct and ethical lapses.  Implementing the recommendations “will improve our culture, promote fairness and accountability, and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated,” said Liane Hornsey, Uber’s chief human resources officer. “While change does not happen overnight, we’re committed to rebuilding trust with our employees, riders and drivers.” The report, recommendations of which were adopted by the board, said Uber “should reformulate its written cultural values” to “reflect more inclusive and positive behaviors.” The Holder investigation was aimed at cleaning up a corporate culture marred by accusations of harassment, discrimination and cutthroat practices to thwart rivals and evade regulators. The company is facing questions about its covert use of law enforcement-evading software and tactics apparently aimed at disrupting rivals in the ridesharing business.  Tone at the top The report said the reforms should focus on “tone at the top, trust, transformation and accountability.” It said the company should “review and reallocate responsibilities of Kalanick,” and that creating the job of chief operating officer, which was discussed in recent months, “should address this concern to some extent.” Uber should also consider installing an independent board chair, “to serve as an independent check on Uber’s management” and to show it is taking reforms seriously. The Holder report called for “an ethics and culture committee” to oversee Uber’s efforts to maintain ethical business practices. Uber should implement mandatory training for managers and key leaders, create a “robust” complaint process and take steps to ensure more minorities are hired, it added. An audio recording of Tuesday’s meeting released by Yahoo Finance indicated some tense moments. Board member Arianna Huffington referred to Kalanick as “the elephant in the room,” but she also called the change “a seminal moment” for Uber. When Huffington spoke of bringing another woman to the board, fellow board member David Bonderman commented that this would lead to “more talking.” Bonderman later apologized, according to a statement released to HuffPost. A statement released by early Uber investors Mitch and Freada Kapor said they were encouraged by the “thoughtful and extensive” recommendations. Vivek Wadhwa, a Carnegie Mellon University fellow who follows the technology industry, welcomed the “solid recommendations” unveiled by the company.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Also commend (Kalanick) for stepping aside and doing what is right for company and employees. Expect he and company will be stronger and better,” Wadhwa tweeted. Uber, which is the world’s richest venture-backed startup valued at some $68 billion, operates in dozens of countries despite problems with regulators in many jurisdictions and protests from established taxi operators. The San Francisco group parted ways this week with its number two executive, Emil Michael, who had been reportedly linked to a number of questionable practices at Uber, including a visit to a South Korean escort-karaoke bar and an attempt to dig up embarrassing information on journalists. Last week, Uber said it had fired 20 people following preliminary results of the investigation, after examining 215 claims of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional behavior, bullying, retaliation and “physical security.” It remains to be seen what impact will be felt by the absence of Kalanick, who has been the driving force behind Uber despite a series of embarrassing missteps.

Poe, chairman of the Senate committee on public services, recently met with the heads of the LTFRB and Uber in a bid to iron out issues that had caused inconvenience to Uber drivers and the riding public.  After the meeting, Uber committed to pay “millions of pesos” worth of fine to the LTFRB so it would overturn its earlier decision to suspend the ride-sharing firm’s operations for a month. The LTFRB has yet to decide on Uber’s offer which will be heard in a board meeting on Wednesday next week. READ: Uber willing to pay hefty fine as ‘rectification’ for mess with LTFRB  But in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel on Friday, Poe said aside from the P10 million Uber offered to pay to the LTFRB for violating certain policies, Uber will also give monetary assistance to its around 66,000 drivers daily. READ: Uber offers to pay P10-M fine instead of serving suspension  “You try to multiple that. They (Uber) said they have about 66,000 drivers, then they will have to do the algorithm and formula for this based on how active you are. Something like P100 per day for lost wages but other drivers can receive as much as P1,200 a day depending on how active they are so that will equate, when we were computing how much they will actually write in the pleading, to more than a P100 million,” Poe said. The P10 million that will go the LTFRB will not go to the agency, but to the national treasury according to LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III, said Poe. “It’s P10 million being offered to the LTFRB for the damages for the violations, which will not really stay with the LTFRB, chairman Delgra clarified that will go the national treasury,” she said. But the remaining amount of over P100 million, Poe said, would only be 5 percent of what Uber is earning in a year. “Uber makes money of at least P5 million a day from their drivers; so how much is that, P5 million times 30 days, let’s say so that’s P150 million in a month, something like that,” Poe explained.  “That’s more than how many percent of what they’re earning in a year that’s about maybe 5 percent or more of what they earn in a year so it’s more than a slap on the wrist but since this is very new, it should also send a signal to others,” she said.

Bobby Coronel, founder of drivers’ group TopSpeed, said it was high time that Mr. Duterte stepped in to address the issues faced by their sector, saying thousands of drivers affected by the moratorium just want “to work and earn a decent living for their families.”  “Tatay Digong, we are calling on you to help us. We fully support your programs. We only want to have a good and proper job,” Coronel said in a press briefing in Quezon City. Coronel and several allied groups went to the Department of Transportation to submit a written appeal, which they said bore the signaturesof 122,000 passengers and drivers, mostly from transport network company (TNC) Grab.  Tim Orbos, the undersecretary for road transport, assured the groups they would “find ways to solve this impasse,” but said they should also “understand [the government’s] point of view.” “We do not want them to stop their operations. We have to do our task as government. We understand that there’s a problem [in our mass transport systems]. Definitely, we would not do something that would further inconvenience the public,” he said.  In July last year, the LTFRB issued the moratorium as it cited the need to look into various concerns arising from the rapid acceptance of app-based transport services, such as surge pricing, passenger security and accountability of the drivers. Earlier this month, the LTFRB announced it would start apprehending Grab and Uber drivers whom the TNCs allowed to operate without a provisional authority (PA) or certificates of public convenience (CPCs). The crackdown, which could affect more than 40,000 drivers, was supposed to take effect on July 26 but was put on hold on Thursday after Grab and Uber filed motions for reconsideration. At present, just about 3,700 drivers have been issued PAs and CPCs. The LTFRB earlier said it would fast-track the approval of around 11,000 applications. Meanwhile, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada yesterday disclosed that the original accreditation documents of Uber and Grab could not be found when she and other appointees of the Duterte administration took over the board last year.  “We tried to locate the accreditation folders of both Uber and Grab. However, after searching the office of the executive director and the chair, they were nowhere to be found,” Lizada said. But the matter was a nonissue for former board member Ariel Inton.“It is very easy to get a copy, assuming it was lost,” Inton said. “If it was lost in the executive director’s office, there are other copies [in other offices].” Inton added that all LTFRB documents were “properly turned over” by former chair Winston Ginez to his successor, Martin Delgra III. Grab’s accreditation as a TNC expired earlier this month while that of Uber will expire next month. Lizada explained that the loss of the accreditation papers would have no effect on the renewal of their accreditation. Both TNCs have already submitted their petitions for renewal."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919650/number-of-uber-grab-vehicles-shocks-ltfrb","title":"Number of Uber, Grab vehicles shocks LTFRB","date":"01:11 PM August 02, 2017","snippet":"Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Martin Delgra III on Wednesday said he is “shocked” to learn of the number of Uber and Grab vehicles plying the roads of Metro Manila which the transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) companies earlier did not reveal.","body":"Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Martin Delgra III on Wednesday said he is “shocked” to learn of the number of Uber and Grab vehicles plying the roads of Metro Manila which the transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) companies earlier did not reveal. During a transportation committee hearing at the House of Representatives, Delgra expressed shock at the numbers provided by Uber and Grab on the number of ride-hailing and -sharing vehicles operating in Manila.  Asked by lawmakers on the number of vehicles operating under Uber, Uber Philippines government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said there are 66,000 Uber cars which had travelled at least one trip for one year. Of the 66,000 Uber vehicles, 2,500 have provisional authority from the LTFRB, while there are 1,000 with pending extension of this authority.  READ: ‘Defiant’ Uber probed; execs air lament Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu for his part said of the 52,398 Grab cars, only 3,000 to 4000 have provisional authority from the LTFRB.  Delgra lamented that Uber and Grab during a previous hearing with the LTFRB said each of these companies only have 28,000 vehicles plying Metro Manila streets. “During the July hearing, they have about 28,000 more or less each. And today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked,” Delgra said. “The number we heard today… These are the data we’ve been trying to get since last year, because we need to understand precisely the issue of accountability,” he added. READ: DOTr: Grab, Uber must follow rules Uber’s public policy director Damian Kassabgi for his part said as much as 60 percent of Uber drivers do not go full time, and that only less than 10,000 vehicles drive for the ride-sharing services at any point.  He said the sheer number of registered Uber vehicles in Manila does not mean it is equivalent to one ride-sharing car per one taxi, belying criticisms that the deluge of transportation network service vehicles worsened the traffic in the metropolis. “We seem to be getting stuck to the numbers, this and that. I want to make it clear, that one taxi is not equivalent to one ride sharing car… What’s relevant is how many cars are at any one point,” Kassabgi said. He added that Uber only deploys enough number of vehicles to meet the riders’ demand. “60 percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full time drivers. Many drive for less than 10 hours a week. One taxi car is equivalent to one ride sharing car is simply not true.. It’s important not to get stuck on the numbers here,” he added. Cu added that Grab only deploys enough vehicles to meet the demand numbering around five percent. “As of now the numbers we accredited, they don’t ply the roads on an hourly basis…. If we don’t grow supply by three percent a week, then there would be passengers who would not get a ride,” Cu said.

The LTFRB ordered Uber to pay the huge fine instead after lifting its one-month suspension, imposed on Aug. 14, that sparked public outrage and forced 36,367 vehicles off the streets.  “We’re working hard to meet the conditions for the lifting of the suspension and hope to resume operations as soon as possible,” said Cat Avelino, Uber’s head of communications, in a statement. On its Twitter account, Uber said it hoped to resume service  “this coming week.”  The transport agency said late on Friday that it would grant Uber’s petition to resume operations in exchange for the P190-million fine — much stiffer than Uber’s P10-million offer. It also required the company to pay about P20 million a day in financial assistance to its drivers for lost earnings.  Sen. Grace Poe welcomed the lifting of Uber’s suspension but nevertheless expressed disappointment at the timing of the decision. Poe, who chairs the Senate committee on public services, pointed out that Uber would be unable to comply with the LTFRB order at once because the banks are closed on weekends. The LTFRB handed down its ruling right before the start of a three-day weekend, thus depriving Uber the chance to immediately resume service. “I am quite disappointed that the LTFRB decision was issued late Friday afternoon, effectively taking out any opportunity for Uber to pay the penalties,” Poe said in a statement. “It is frustrating to think that we have a long weekend ahead of us and people will have to suffer the inconvenience of having limited transportation choices in going around Metro [Manila] with their families,” she added.  Because the country is commemorating National Heroes Day tomorrow, the earliest that Uber can only comply with the board’s order is on Tuesday. In its eight-page order, the LTFRB said that Uber’s fine was “commensurate to the penalty of suspension.” It added that based on the data submitted by Uber, the company earned between P7 million and P10 million daily from about 150,000 trips. “[The P190-million fine] is arrived at by taking into consideration the number of days that respondent should be suspended in relation to the daily average income,” the order read. Uber was suspended for defying an LTFRB moratorium on the acceptance of new drivers as the agency studied how to regulate the growing ride-sharing industry. Uber’s rival Grab followed the directive. After filing a motion for reconsideration on Aug. 15, Uber resumed operations, only to stop on the same day when the LTFRB board denied its petition. “The online ride-sharing services of the respondent (Uber) will be restored when it has paid the amount of fine and the said financial assistance [to Uber drivers] remitted,” the board resolution said. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that Uber should continue to provide assistance to its drivers until it had settled the fine. She added that for Uber to resume operations, it should provide proof of compliance from its bank, indicating that the drivers had indeed received the amount due them. The board explained that Uber’s P190-million fine is only about a third of what it would have spent if it fully served its suspension. Uber would have also shelled out about P597 million in financial aid to its drivers for a month. But Poe said the LTFRB could have offered relief to a lot more people had it given Uber the chance to comply with the ruling at once. “If the LTFRB had allowed Uber to operate right away, then this could have served as a great relief to our people, most of whom rely on TNVS (transport network vehicle service) due to the comfort, reliability and safety they provide,” she said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The P190-million penalty, she also said, “should be enough to make Uber rethink its actions and reevaluate its strategy in testing the extent of government regulations.” Commuters had voiced out their disappointment in the suspension of Uber, saying services like these offered a convenient alternative, especially with problems with irascible and choosy taxi drivers who overcharged fares. Uber said this month it was accepting new applications for vehicles but was not processing them pending its discussions with the LTFRB. It also urged the government to simplify the accreditation process, with a representative telling Poe’s committee: “We cannot impose 1900s regulations on today’s technological innovations.” —With a report from AFP"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/186170/uber-technologies-expanding-in-ph","title":"Uber Technologies expanding in PH","date":"05:41 AM February 06, 2015","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines–San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, operator of a wildly popular smartphone application that connects drivers and passengers,  is keen on expanding its presence in the Philippines with the upcoming release of landmark rules in the region.","body":"MANILA, Philippines–San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, operator of a wildly popular smartphone application that connects drivers and passengers,  is keen on expanding its presence in the Philippines with the upcoming release of landmark rules in the region. But certain kinks, like the proposed  regulation of Uber’s pricing scheme, needs further “reconsideration,” Michael Brown, Uber regional general manager, said in a rare interview in Manila this week.  Brown said Uber welcomed the release of the new guidelines, which has yet to receive the final approval of Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya, as a way to move forward following a brief run-in with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board in late 2014. He noted that Uber, whose growth has skyrocketed globally since it started in 2009 and is now valued at more than $40 billion, agreed with most of the new guidelines, which would require drivers here to get government permits apart from more stringent safety measures like criminal background checks.  “The Philippines would be the first jurisdiction in Asia to have this kind of regulation,” Brown said. The new rules  will likewise lend added legitimacy to Uber’s domestic business. Uber, which owns no cars and provides only the platform, has been recording fast growth since it officially began in Metro Manila in February 2014, Brown said.  It makes money by taking a cut out of the fare, usually 20 percent. Brown declined to give figures specific to the Philippines but said the Uber X product, for more compact vehicles, offers cheaper fares compared to standard taxis. The company expects to lure “tens of thousands” of  Filipino drivers over the next few years. He said plans to expand outside Metro Manila were also in the cards.  As noted, a thorny issue here is related to the regulation of Uber’s pricing scheme, which can fluctuate depending on the volume of vehicles on the road. For example, prices can fall below regular  taxi rates during lean hours but they also climb significantly higher during “rush hours.” “We have made transportation less expensive for people and drivers are making more money than they have ever made. What we are advocating is that the government here should allow us to do what we do well,” Brown said. “We have expressed a desire for them [LTFRB] to rethink that aspect of the regulation,” said Brown, adding that their pricing model is regulated nowhere else in the world. Right now, the LTFRB is keen on regulating fares—its mandate under the law, LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez said in a separate interview. He said the draft had been submitted to Abaya and further meetings were likely required. “We know the economics of this [ business] and we will not be unreasonable. But we want to have the final say. We don’t want prices to be abused,” Ginez said.  He said he was hoping to release the final rules within the month."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/801057/uber-summoned-driver-accused-of-rape","title":"Uber summoned; driver accused of rape","date":"05:03 AM July 30, 2016","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has called officials of Uber System Inc. to a hearing in connection with a rape complaint filed by a passenger against an Uber car driver in Quezon City.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has called officials of Uber System Inc. to a hearing in connection with a rape complaint filed by a passenger against an Uber car driver in Quezon City. LTFRB issued a show cause order to the transport network company (TNC) on Friday,  asking the firm to disclose details about the driver to help the complainant. Board member Ariel Inton said the agency had received a report that a 22-year-old woman was sexually abused on Wednesday afternoon by an Uber driver who picked her up at Camp Aguinaldo.  According to a report filed in the Quezon City Police District, the driver of a red Toyota Vios (ARA 3101), identified as Xstian Karlou John Marie, suddenly embraced the victim and told her to hold his genitals while they were passing through Katipunan Avenue, near UP Town Center,  around 2:30 p.m. As the victim tried to break free from the suspect, he allegedly pulled her hair to force her to perform oral sex, but she managed to escape.  The LTFRB asked Uber officials to appear in a hearing on Aug. 10. Citing the board’s “frustrations,” Inton noted that Uber “doesn’t give the real identity of their ‘peers’ or driver/operator” as it invokes its privacy policy. “It has come to our attention that Uber does not disclose the name of the driver or any of its details to their passenger. When a crime is committed, it would be very hard for the victim to file a case because no detail with regard to the perpetrator is provided,” Inton said in a statement. LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra also ordered Uber to disclose the driver’s identity and other personal details, stressing that “it is a franchise requirement.” In a statement issued Friday afternoon, Uber said it had already removed the driver—  whom it did not name—from its platform and gotten in touch with authorities involved in the investigation. “First and foremost our thoughts are with the rider and her family. We immediately removed the driver from the Uber platform when we learned of the reported incident and are cooperating fully with law enforcement in their ongoing investigation and stand ready to assist them in every way we can,” the company said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919875/think-tank-scrap-limit-on-uber-grab","title":"Think tank: Scrap limit on Uber, Grab","date":"05:25 AM August 03, 2017","snippet":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab.","body":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab. FEF — an advocacy group for good economic governance and market-friendly reforms — said Uber, Grab, Easy Taxi, Wunder carpool, Angkas and similar ride-sharing services were doing the riding public a service that regular public utility vehicles had been unable to provide.  The benefits come from on-demand service, ability to provide feedback and choice despite the lack of visible markings, as well as safety and peace of mind due to thorough screening and training provided by the ride-sharing services and feedback from the riding public, the group said in a statement on Wednesday. FEF said it was therefore “untimely and inappropriate” for the LTRFB to curtail the service by capping the number of permits issued to the drivers of these ride-sharing services.  It stressed: “Limiting the number of vehicles allowed to do ride-sharing is not only anticompetitive, but it also forces the riding public to use their own cars on the road to add to the traffic congestion and also compels them to bear with the abuses perpetuated by regulated private utility vehicles, such as taxis.” FEF is chaired by former Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, with Romy Bernardo as vice chair and Calixto Chikiamco as president. Its senior advisers are former Prime Minister and Finance Minister Cesar Virata and UP Economics Professor Emeritus and former Economic Planning Minister Gerardo Sicat.  Market forces, public good Board members include Anthony Abad, Art Corpuz, Eduardo Gana, Felipe Medalla, Vaugh Montes, Simon Paterno, Perry Pe and Gloria Tan-Climaco. The group added that recent discussions on minimum working hours for drivers and other comments demonizing surge pricing should be reconsidered by looking at this from the perspective of how market forces could serve the public good. Surge pricing during peak hours, it said, encourages drivers to make themselves available when they are needed most. From the point of view of riders, it encourages them to plan their trips to avoid the busy, more expensive periods. “Surge pricing, therefore, creates behavior that self-corrects fares to lower levels.  In contrast, minimum working hours only fill the street with additional cars when less needed, adding to traffic congestion, wasting fuel and oversupply,” FEF said.  The group said there’s a clear need to update and modernize the Public Service Act to account for this wave of technology-enabled transport services with the objective of serving and protecting the public. The regulators must incorporate the principles of technology and the market to improve public transport services in cities around the country, FEF said. In addition, FEF said Congress should review Executive Order 202, which created the LTFRB, to clarify the mandate and regulatory powers of the agency “in light of new technology and the need of the public for safe, affordable, and convenient public transport services.” ‘Shocked’ at House hearing The group issued the statement three weeks after the LTFRB imposed a P5-million fine each on Uber and Grab for violating its year-old moratorium on the acceptance of new partner drivers. When it ordered the ban in July 2016, the board said it had to review guidelines concerning surge pricing, passenger security and drivers’ accountability, among others. In a House committee hearing on Wednesday, the two TNCs disclosed the current size of their driver memberships and vehicle accreditations—figures that “shocked” LTFRB chair Martin Delgra. Uber government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said the company had 66,000 partners “who have taken at least one trip in the past year.” Of this number, only 2,500 drivers have provisional authority to operate while another 1,000 have pending motions for extension, he said. Meanwhile, Grab country head Brian Cu said the company had 52,398 accredited vehicles, of which 3,000 to 4,000 had provisional authority to operate. Delgra said the huge figures came as a shock to him and the agency. “During the July hearing (at the LTFRB),” he recalled, “they said they have 28,000 more or less each. Today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked.” “It is good you were able to solicit the numbers directly from them,” Delgra told the House transportation committee. “These are the data we have been trying to get since last year to exact accountability as well as address the issue of price surging.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But Uber’s public policy director Damian Kassabgi said policymakers should not put too much weight on the number of drivers, as only a small proportion of them actually plied the road at any given time. “Sixty percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full-time drivers.

The pioneering company has been facing pressure to rein in a no-holds-barred management style led by Kalanick and to reform its workplace culture, which has sparked charges of harassment and discrimination.  “If we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve,” the 40-year-old Kalanick said in an email to Uber employees. Kalanick said one of the reasons for his stepping aside was the recent death of his mother, explaining he needs time off “to reflect, to work on myself and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team.”  Kalanick said he would remain available as needed during his absence for “the most strategic decisions.” Uber simultaneously released a 13-page document calling for major reforms at the company based on a probe led by former US attorney general Eric Holder, who investigated allegations of misconduct and ethical lapses.  Implementing the recommendations “will improve our culture, promote fairness and accountability, and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated,” said Liane Hornsey, Uber’s chief human resources officer. “While change does not happen overnight, we’re committed to rebuilding trust with our employees, riders and drivers.” The report, recommendations of which were adopted by the board, said Uber “should reformulate its written cultural values” to “reflect more inclusive and positive behaviors.” The Holder investigation was aimed at cleaning up a corporate culture marred by accusations of harassment, discrimination and cutthroat practices to thwart rivals and evade regulators. The company is facing questions about its covert use of law enforcement-evading software and tactics apparently aimed at disrupting rivals in the ridesharing business.  Tone at the top The report said the reforms should focus on “tone at the top, trust, transformation and accountability.” It said the company should “review and reallocate responsibilities of Kalanick,” and that creating the job of chief operating officer, which was discussed in recent months, “should address this concern to some extent.” Uber should also consider installing an independent board chair, “to serve as an independent check on Uber’s management” and to show it is taking reforms seriously. The Holder report called for “an ethics and culture committee” to oversee Uber’s efforts to maintain ethical business practices. Uber should implement mandatory training for managers and key leaders, create a “robust” complaint process and take steps to ensure more minorities are hired, it added. An audio recording of Tuesday’s meeting released by Yahoo Finance indicated some tense moments. Board member Arianna Huffington referred to Kalanick as “the elephant in the room,” but she also called the change “a seminal moment” for Uber. When Huffington spoke of bringing another woman to the board, fellow board member David Bonderman commented that this would lead to “more talking.” Bonderman later apologized, according to a statement released to HuffPost. A statement released by early Uber investors Mitch and Freada Kapor said they were encouraged by the “thoughtful and extensive” recommendations. Vivek Wadhwa, a Carnegie Mellon University fellow who follows the technology industry, welcomed the “solid recommendations” unveiled by the company.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Also commend (Kalanick) for stepping aside and doing what is right for company and employees. Expect he and company will be stronger and better,” Wadhwa tweeted. Uber, which is the world’s richest venture-backed startup valued at some $68 billion, operates in dozens of countries despite problems with regulators in many jurisdictions and protests from established taxi operators. The San Francisco group parted ways this week with its number two executive, Emil Michael, who had been reportedly linked to a number of questionable practices at Uber, including a visit to a South Korean escort-karaoke bar and an attempt to dig up embarrassing information on journalists. Last week, Uber said it had fired 20 people following preliminary results of the investigation, after examining 215 claims of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional behavior, bullying, retaliation and “physical security.” It remains to be seen what impact will be felt by the absence of Kalanick, who has been the driving force behind Uber despite a series of embarrassing missteps.

But the remaining amount of over P100 million, Poe said, would only be 5 percent of what Uber is earning in a year. “Uber makes money of at least P5 million a day from their drivers; so how much is that, P5 million times 30 days, let’s say so that’s P150 million in a month, something like that,” Poe explained.  “That’s more than how many percent of what they’re earning in a year that’s about maybe 5 percent or more of what they earn in a year so it’s more than a slap on the wrist but since this is very new, it should also send a signal to others,” she said.

Grab announced Monday it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation.  In exchange, California-based Uber will get a 27.5-percent stake in the combined business—a move seen to cut Uber’s massive losses as it prepares to go public next year. Grab said the figure reflected Uber’s market share in the region. In the Philippines, Grab has taken out a key rival in an environment where growth has been constrained by a ride-sharing vehicle cap implemented by regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).Moreover, the companies might need the approval of the Philippine Competition Commission before completing the deal in the country.PCC commissioner Johannes Bernabe said if the deal met the agency’s transaction thresholds, then the parties must file a transaction notice.“Parties have 30 days from execution of their definitive agreement within which to notify the PCC,” he said in a text message on Monday. He said parties “are not supposed to consummate their transaction” while PCC reviews the deal.According to Grab, Uber’s service in Southeast Asia would be available until April 8 this year as drivers transition to Grab’s platform. Moreover, Uber’s business services would no longer be supported in Southeast Asia after the transaction.“With a larger fleet of drivers on our platform, passenger transportation needs will be met faster. Passengers will get to enjoy shorter waiting times, more convenient and affordable rides through one platform,” Grab said.It said the fare structure for passengers alongside incentives and benefits for drivers would remain the same.  A Grab spokesperson declined to share domestic figures although the company, which launched in 2012 as a taxi-booking service, claimed that around five million people use its platform every day. The ride-sharing demand-and-supply gap is pronounced in the Philippines, where a more than 10-minute wait for a ride is not unusual. LTFRB recently capped the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) at 65,000 for Metro Manila, 1,500 units for Cebu and 250 for Pampanga. This followed an almost two-year moratorium.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Feb. 23 that the cap would be enough to serve around 75 percent of existing demand. It will be reviewed every three months. Lizada said passengers should ideally wait just two to three minutes for their ride. The transition worried the likes of Marcial, who declined to have his surname published. He cited key differences in how Grab and Uber drivers accept passengers. Grab drivers are allowed to view the destination of riders before accepting a trip— a feature not allowed in Uber. As noted, Grab and Uber would be “working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders” over the next two weeks. “We are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family. They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement on Monday."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1407501/maskless-uber-passenger-arrested-for-pepper-spraying-coughing-on-driver","title":"Maskless Uber passengers arrested for pepper spraying, coughing on driver","date":"12:32 PM March 16, 2021","snippet":"Two women were arrested for pepper spraying and coughing on an Uber driver who refused to give them a ride for not wearing face masks.","body":"Two women were arrested for pepper spraying and coughing on an Uber driver who refused to give them a ride for not wearing face masks. Uber driver Subhakar Khadka, 32, picked up three female passengers from the neighborhood of Bayview in San Francisco on March 7. Khadka claimed that one of his passengers was not wearing a face mask, so he politely told her that he cannot continue with the ride unless she wears one, CBS Los Angeles reported on March 9.  Despite the gentle reminder from the driver about the health protocol, the woman still refused to wear a mask. Instead, she started yelling and attacking him. The scuffle was captured on video and shared by the news outlet’s reporter Betty Yu via Twitter on March 9. It can be seen in the video that one of the women who shouted profanities at Khadka also coughed on him and grabbed his cellphone. She also ripped the face mask he was wearing.   “If I was another complexion, I would have not gotten that treatment from them,” Khadka said in the report, adding that he thinks the hostility was related to race. He also claimed that when the women eventually got out of his car, they pepper sprayed him from a gap in his passenger window. This forced him to vacate his vehicle because it became difficult to breathe. The suspects in the case were identified by the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) in a March 11 release. One of them was Malaysia King, 24, who was arrested on charges of assault with a caustic chemical, assault and battery, conspiracy and violation of health and safety code. Arna Kimiai, 24, was also identified as another suspect but she did not immediately surrender to authorities. She is the woman in the video seen grabbing Khadka’s cellphone. Through her counsel, expressed intent to turn herself in, as stated in the release. She kept her word and was taken into custody on March 14.  Kimiai was arrested at the San Francisco County Jail for charges of robbery, assault and battery, conspiracy, and violation of health and safety code, a follow-up statement from the SFPD said. Lieutenant Tracy McCray, head of the department’s Robbery Detail, assured the public that the SFPD is committed to the case and that they are taking COVID-19 protocols seriously.

Danyal Cheema, 24, an Uber driver, is facing the charge of second-degree manslaughter after Ryan Mullen, 15, died due to a traumatic brain injury from the fall, reported WABC yesterday, Nov. 5.  Cheema was driving a 2010 Toyota Highlander SUV when he picked up three teenage boys in Long Island past midnight on Sept. 23. The boys had been drinking and partying. The driver said he was offered $70 to let them climb on the roof of the car and “surf.” The boys took back their offer but later offered $40, which Cheema accepted.  Two boys, one of whom was Mullen, were atop the roop while Cheema drove. The third companion recorded them on a Snapchat video. When Mullen fell off the vehicle, his head struck the pavement and suffered from blunt force trauma, which fractured his skull. The driver took the boys to their destination, the house of Mullen’s friend. Mullen died in his sleep later in the day.  Cheema was arrested on Sunday and pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter during his arraignment on Monday, reported NBC News earlier today, Nov. 6. His bail is set at $200,000 cash or $400,000 bond. His license has been suspended and Uber has permanently removed him from the app. If convicted, he faces five to 15 years in prison. He is set to return to court on Friday.  Niña V.

Raymund Liboro, head of the National Privacy Commission (NPC), said only the users’ registered name, e-mail address, and phone number were compromised. In a statement, Liboro said Uber Philippines, the local arm of the ridesharing company, had confirmed on Thursday that the extent of the impact was limited to these bits of information.  However, the NPC chief also noted receiving a report of “irregular processing” that suggests other data may have also been compromised, an allegation that the commission would still have to confirm in order to establish its link to the 2016 data breach incident. “We were informed that around 171,000 Filipino citizens consisting of drivers and passengers were affected by the breach. We understand this to be based on the mobile phone numbers included in the registry,” he said. “We were also informed that the exposure of the affected data subjects was limited to their registered name, e-mail address and phone number.”  It remains unclear if specific Uber users would be informed that they were hacked. The company’s US office last month made an admission of the breach, noting that the personal information of tens of millions of users worldwide had been compromised by a hack that Uber kept secret for more than a year. Prior to Thursday’s disclosure, Uber Philippines could only confirm that Filipino users were also affected by the hack, without giving exact numbers. 1.3M active riders According to Liboro, Uber Philippines reported having 1.3 million active riders in the country. The number of Uber drivers, meanwhile, is still up for validation but Liboro gave an estimate of below 100,000.  Uber’s explanation of the hack could be read on its official website. There is also an option for users to alert Uber if they think they’ve been hacked. Reached for comment on Friday, Uber Philippines neither confirmed nor denied if the company would actively inform users if they were among 171,000 Filipinos whose personal information had been compromised. Instead, Catherine Avelino, head of communications of Uber Philippines, referred the Inquirer to Uber’s blog post about the hack, stressing it has “everything we’re doing and have done.” Liboro said the NPC is now looking into the processes and procedures that Uber said it had taken “to ensure that this matter never happens again.” “We are paying particular attention to the steps taken to ensure that in the future, data breaches of this magnitude will not be concealed from regulators and from affected data subjects,” he said, noting that concealment of data breaches is a criminal offense. Liboro also said further assistance to affected users could be included in NPC’s compliance order for Uber. Uber Philippines previously claimed having no knowledge of the incident prior to the recent public admission made by its US office. Under the Data Privacy Act of 2012, concealing security breaches that involve sensitive personal information faces a penalty that could reach up to five years of imprisonment and a fine of less than P500,000. The necessary penalties, according to the law, would be imposed on people who, after learning about the breach, decided to conceal the fact, regardless of whether it was done intentionally or by omission."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/690850/dotc-now-regulates-app-based-transport-services-like-uber-grabtaxi","title":"DOTC now regulates app-based transport services like Uber, GrabTaxi","date":"04:40 PM May 12, 2015","snippet":"The Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) has created a new category to allow app-based public utility vehicles and services to operate in the Philippines.","body":"The Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) has created a new category to allow app-based public utility vehicles and services to operate in the Philippines. According to Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya, the new classification of public transport is in line with the agency’s “effort to modernize transportation services and usher in the conveniences offered by technological innovation.”  “We view technological innovation as a driver for progress, especially in transportation where it can provide safer and more convenient commuting options to the public. App-based transport services help address the increasing demand for mobility spurred by rapid urbanization,” Abaya said in a press statement. He said a Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) classification has been created to allow app-based services offered by Transportation Network Companies (TNC) to exist within DOTC’s regulatory framework.  READ: LTFRB proposes bill to regulate Uber, online transpo services The transport official said that under a new classification, “a TNC is defined as an organization that provides pre-arranged transportation services for compensation using an internet-based technology application or a digital platform technology to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles.”  “TNCs will provide the public with online-enabled transportation services known as a TNVS, which will connect drivers with ride-seekers through an app,” he said. Under the TNVS, certain standards for vehicle eligibility such as a global positioning system (GPS) tracking and navigation devices for convenient and safer services are required. He said only sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV), Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), vans, or other similar vehicles would be allowed. A maximum age limit of seven (7) years will be enforced on the vehicles, he added. According to him, operators will be required to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) for every vehicle to ensure accountability.  READ: Draft LTFRB order: Uber cars, etc., must apply for franchise To promote passenger safety, he said, drivers must be screened and accredited by the TNCs and registered with the land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB.) “Many people appreciate the safe and convenient services offered by the TNVS category. We want this to motivate other public utility vehicle operators to modernize, upgrade, and innovate their services for the benefit of the public,” he said.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said on Tuesday that it would review the Grab-Uber deal, hoping to buy more time by convincing the popular ride-hailing firms to delay their transaction.  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian Internet company. Uber is already scheduled to stop operations on April 8. PCC would be reviewing the deal even after the parties involved said that the transaction was not notifiable under current PCC rules. Technically, Uber and Grab are already allowed to push through with their deal.  However, the law also allows PCC to review a non-notifiable deal if the antitrust body finds a “reasonable basis” to do so, according to PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan in an interview with reporters. Notifiable transactions are mergers and acquisitions (M&As) that meet certain requirements deemed to be potentially anti-competitive in the market. Such deal is not allowed to be acted on until PCC finishes its review of the notifiable M&A.  Depending on how the companies would cooperate, the review, which would see if the acquisition is anti-competition, could take months. The first phase of the review takes at most 75 days, Balisacan said. However, if there would be “serious gaps in our analysis because of a lack of information,” the review could extend for another 120 days at most, he added. What would happen in the meantime is yet to be seen. PCC officials would meet with Grab and Uber to discuss interim measures which both PCC and the companies would have to agree on.  “The interim measure is intended so that the review would not be compromised. [Essentially, it means] that the situation that was prevailing before the consummation of the transaction would continue to prevail,” he said. It is still unclear if the upcoming monopoly would agree on PCC’s terms. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919535/defiant-uber-probed-execs-air-lament","title":"‘Defiant’ Uber probed; execs air lament","date":"05:43 AM August 02, 2017","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has ordered officials of the transport network company Uber to appear in a hearing today, citing its alleged defiance of an order for TNCs to stop accepting new drivers.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has ordered officials of the transport network company Uber to appear in a hearing today, citing its alleged defiance of an order for TNCs to stop accepting new drivers. The LTFRB said that despite its July 26 order for TNCs Grab and Uber to stop, Uber “willfully and contumaciously violate[d]” the directive. Uber was also given five days to submit a explanation why its accreditation should not be canceled.  The LTFRB is currently reviewing the accreditation of the TNCs. Grab’s accreditation expired last month and while that of Uber is set to expire this month. But in a text message to the Inquirer, Uber communications head Cat Avelino maintained the company had suspended new driver and vehicle activations since July 19, or eight days after the LTFRB issued an initial order for TNCs to stop accepting new applications.  “[W]e have not resumed since then. As a result, 14,000 riders are unable to book a ride every day,” Avelino said. Last month, the LTFRB ordered the TNCs to stop the operation of drivers who do not have a certificate of public convenience or a provisional authority to operate. But the crackdown on colorum vehicles was deferred after the TNCs filed a motion for reconsideration.  PH lagging behind Of the estimated 42,000 Uber and Grab drivers, only about 3,700 have permits to operate. In a press conference on Tuesday, the eve of the hearing, Uber regional and local officials noted how the country had fallen behind its Southeast Asian neighbors in appreciating the benefits of the ride-sharing industry. They also raised concerns over a recent proposal to impose a supply cap on Uber and Grab vehicles, while reiterating calls for the government to lift the year-old suspension on the acceptance of new member drivers. “One of the shames about the Philippines is that back in 2015, there was a real sense that there was a clear momentum in this country to have the first national ride-sharing regulations,” said Damian Kassabgi, Uber Asia Pacific head of public policy.  “But frankly, since then, you’ve seen countries around the region overtake (the Philippines) in relation to their understanding of the service, and the way they are putting a framework around it,” he said. Kassabgi noted that Malaysia recently passed legislation in support of ride-sharing without price controls or supply caps. Against core principles These are areas the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said it wanted to regulate. In terms of caps, there was a proposal last week to put a limit on the number of ride-sharing vehicles on the road. The LTFRB also saw a need for their drivers to put in a minimum number of hours. Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said these proposals would go against the core principles of ride-sharing, which was flexibility for both passengers and drivers. “What I can tell you is that 60 percent of drivers use [Uber] on a part time basis,” Cua said, referring to drivers who work six hours or less. Citing fluctuations in supply and demand, Cua also warned that limiting the number of eligible ride-sharing applications that can be approved would be “damaging” to the industry. Uber Philippines alone has some 30,000 drivers and one million active users, Cua said. ‘Taxi way of thinking’ “Having these supply caps is very much a taxi way of thinking about the world,” Kassabgi, citing countries like Malaysia and Singapore which have tight controls on private car ownership. “We do not see this concept of supply caps because regulators [elsewhere] understand that this is a demand responsive service.” The LTFRB last month fined Uber and Grab P5 million each for continuing to add new drivers to their networks despite the moratorium imposed by the board in July 2016. The LTFRB at the time said it wanted to review existing policies covering such transport services. According to Cua, some 200,000 rider requests “go unfulfilled”  weekly because of the suspension."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978890/drivers-start-massive-migration-to-grab-as-uber-exits","title":"Drivers start massive migration to Grab as Uber exits","date":"09:59 PM March 28, 2018","snippet":"Hundreds of Uber drivers flocked to the Megatent Events Venue in Quezon City on Wednesday – part of a massive migration effort that could involve as many as 24,000 people.","body":"Hundreds of Uber drivers flocked to the Megatent Events Venue in Quezon City on Wednesday – part of a massive migration effort that could involve as many as 24,000 people. It was the second day of an “onboarding” session for Uber drivers in Manila after Singapore-based ridesharing giant Grab acquired the Southeast Asian operations of its main rival.  Should Grab Philippines succeed in luring all of Uber’s drivers, it would corner about 90 percent of Metro Manila’s ridesharing sector, capped at 65,000 units by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). That prospect has consumers worrying about higher costs and poorer services, following the notion that fewer competitors provide fewer incentives for private enterprises to do better.  Standing beside a row of Japanese compact sedans and AUVs, ridesharing’s most popular car models here, Uber driver Patricia was indifferent to a business deal that had only served to disrupt her main source of income. “I have no choice but to move. I borrowed money to buy my car and I need to pay it off,” she told the Inquirer.  In ridesharing, Patricia found a way to make money on her own terms by transporting passengers using Uber’s technology platform whenever she had the free time. In exchange, Uber takes a 25 percent cut. Patricia was among dozens of drivers, some with their young children in tow, gathered outside the Megatent on Wednesday. Near the entrance, a Grab staffer was reading out names from a so-called master list provided by the LTFRB. Only those people in the list would be allowed to move to Grab. Uber will cease to operate in Southeast Asia by April 8 this year. But Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu told reporters they would continue to process and accept Uber drivers even after that date.  “We will continue this until all Uber drivers on the master list of the LTFRB are activated on our platform,” Cu said. The mood was lighter inside the air-conditioned Megatent, which could accommodate at least 1,000 people. Migrating Uber drivers, welcomed inside as “Uberkads,” were seated while waiting to be called again to submit their requirements. It was noontime and pastries from a local bakeshop chain were being distributed to the waiting drivers. In another part of the hall, Grab staffers were holding mini orientation sessions for their former rivals. Inside, the Uberkads mused about the driver-friendly features of Grab, such as the ability to see a passenger’s destination before accepting a trip. This is not allowed by Uber. Grab also offers better incentives, they said. They noted that one drawback with Grab was that drivers would need to keep a minimum amount of money in its system to continue booking passengers. It is from this fund that Grab takes it commission. According to Cu, services are also expected to improve. He noted that when there were two big operators, drivers simply switched networks when penalized for bad behavior, such as frequently canceling rides. “Now, there is a bit more weight to following the rules,” Cu said. He added that the enlarged network of Grab would help control prices, given the supply-demand algorithms utilized by the ridesharing sector, and improved waiting times.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said in a press conference Wednesday that fare hikes would also be strictly regulated. Moreover, new competition is on the way with local companies Lag Go, Owto and Hype each seeking to operate as a transport network company, the formal category for businesses like Uber and Grab. “So if you say there is no competition, soon there will be,” Lizada said. Later addressing the drivers on queue, Lizada urged them to follow regulations, ridesharing being a public service. “Let us start on the proper footing,” she said. Getting started is the most important issue for Rex Restauro, who has been an Uber driver for eight months. Restauro, who owns a computer shop, uses ridesharing to make extra income in the evening. He said he has no qualms about switching to Grab. “I’m in this industry anyway so it’s a waste to stop it now.

The Duterte administration welcomes all well-meaning businessmen,” Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade told investors during a gathering in Davao City last Friday.  He made the statement as Uber and Grab drivers appealed to Mr. Duterte to intervene and order the lifting of a yearlong moratorium on the issuance of franchises for app-based transport services. Tugade said the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has asked transport network companies (TNCs) to submit the necessary papers so their accredited transport network vehicle service (TNVS) drivers could operate legally.  At the same time, he wondered why it was taking the drivers such a long time to submit the requirements such as their financial statements and income tax returns. Tugade assured TNCs that the Department of Transportation (DOTr) would process their drivers’ documents as quickly as possible.  “If things can be worked out, if things can be logical, if things can be done on a win-win basis, then let’s shake hands and do business,” he said. The LTFRB earlier announced it would start apprehending TNC drivers without a valid franchise starting on July 26. Last week, however, it agreed to put off the crackdown after Grab and Uber filed separate motions for reconsideration. The LTFRB also said it would fast-track the processing and release of around 11,000 pending franchise applications. According to the transport board, both TNCs have a combined total of 42,000 accredited drivers. Of the figure, however, only 3,700 have been authorized by the LTFRB to operate, making the rest “colorum” vehicles.  Tugade said that the transport department, through the LTFRB, was holding consultations with both Grab and Uber “to clarify some issues on the mess they have created.” “What we are doing right now is putting some sense of reason and sanity [in] the business model Grab and Uber are trying to introduce,” he added, saying the TNCs should “do business on a platform of compliance to level the playing field.” Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez agreed with Tugade that all modes of public transport should operate on equal footing by securing all requirements set by the government. “But we should not prevent them from coming in. As long as the market, the consumer and riding public need these extra services, we should not prevent an entrepreneur from offering something that there’s a demand for in the market,” he said. “It’s really about services and availability. Let’s have a level playing field in the market and let the competitive, the innovative survive,” Lopez added."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/651819/dotc-taxis-must-upgrade-vs-uber","title":"DoTC: Taxis must upgrade vs Uber","date":"04:00 AM November 20, 2014","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines—Taxi operators should modernize and improve their services instead of opposing technology solutions like ride-sharing app Uber.","body":"MANILA, Philippines—Taxi operators should modernize and improve their services instead of opposing technology solutions like ride-sharing app Uber. “People prefer to use these tech-based transport services because they are more convenient. It’s that simple. So my advice to taxi operators: Modernize, innovate and improve your systems and services,” Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said in a statement on Wednesday.  “Commuters say they feel safer taking these private vehicles-for-hire, that the fleet are newer, that app services are faster and more efficient. So why put a stop to what is clearly for their benefit? Poorer services should be upgraded to match their competition—not the other way around,” he added. Abaya’s statement was the latest effort by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) to show that it was open to new technology solutions after the arrest last month of a private vehicle owner who had partnered with Uber. The incident drew intense criticism, mainly from Netizens.  The DOTC’s stance, however, also comes at a time when Uber is facing negative publicity worldwide. It is currently under fire overseas for comments reportedly made by one of its executives on how the firm can finance smear campaigns against journalists critical of it and how Uber personnel can access customers’ private travel information.  “We have not, do not and will not investigate journalists. Those remarks have no basis in the reality of our approach,” an Uber spokesperson said in an e-mail to Inquirer, referring to statements reportedly made by Emil Michael, Uber’s senior vice president of business, at a private event. The incident was first reported by Buzzfeed. Uber further clarified its privacy policy in a Nov. 18 blog post. “Uber has a strict policy prohibiting all employees at every level from accessing a rider or driver’s data. The only exception to this policy is for a limited set of legitimate business purposes. Our policy has been communicated to all employees and contractors,” it said. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is set to hold a hearing on Nov. 24 in line with a plan to update its rules to accommodate technology solutions like Uber, a ride-sharing service available in several countries. The LTFRB has identified the existing “vehicles-for-hire” category as the likely classification for Uber vehicles, it said. While considered “colorum” since these vehicles are operating without a transport franchise, the LTFRB has not taken any further action since the DOTC signaled its intention to work with the service. Ginez earlier said that the arrest in Manila stemmed from complaints filed by various groups, including the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association.  Uber has been facing challenges and even protests in other parts of the world, mainly by taxi operators, who say it and other similar apps allow the operation of illegal public transportation services which are regulated and require a government franchise or permit.

Karen, who studies law at Polytechnic University of the Philippines, told the Inquirer on Monday that while she understands that transport network companies should follow the rules on franchises, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) should be more considerate since thousands of commuters rely on this “convenient” and “efficient” mode of transport.  She said that should the LTFRB push through on July 26 with its decision to apprehend app-based drivers who do not have franchises to operate, she would be forced to ride in taxis whose drivers are sometimes rude and refuse to bring passengers to their destination. Karen added that without the transport network companies (TNCs), her studies might be affected as commuting to school using other mass transport systems like jeepneys and trains would be too tiring.  Regular Uber user Jef Manalac shares Karen’s predicament, adding that some taxi drivers tamper with their meters or do not give the exact change. He noted that instead of focusing on a system that works, the LTFRB should crack down on “colorum” vans and taxis. However, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada stood firm on Monday on their decision against the TNCs, pointing out that they “were simply cleaning up the mess that the TNCs created.”  “The board gave both TNCs the opportunity to comply [with our order] to show good faith. In the event that they refuse or fail to comply, then enforcement is in order. The board will not be influenced nor will it succumb to pressure,” she told reporters. Last week, the LTFRB fined Grab and Uber P5 million each for violating the terms and conditions of their accreditation, such as the inclusion in their platforms of drivers who do not have franchises to operate. Lizada said the TNCs were not given the harshest penalty which was cancelation of their accreditation out of consideration for the riding public. By July 26 though, Grab and Uber drivers without franchises will be fined P120,000 and their vehicles impounded for three months should they continue to operate. Lizada warned that if TNCs defy the LTFRB’s order, “the board might be constrained to apply the full force of the law considering that both [their] accreditations are under review.”  Of the estimated 56,000 drivers of the two TNCs, only more than 3,000 were given franchises by the LTFRB until it imposed a moratorium last year. Bobby Coronel, founder of drivers’ group TopSpeed and a Grab driver, said that they have been trying to comply with the LTFRB’s requirements for the issuance of a franchise. He added though that should the agency push through with its order, they would have no choice but to comply with it. Despite the LTFRB order, Grab said in a statement yesterday that “at this time, we will not deactivate any of our partners.” “Grab will continue reaching out to the government to seek clarity on its order. We urge the LTFRB to convene the technical working group as soon as possible so we can discuss important matters affecting the TNC-TNVS (transport network vehicle service) industry, more so the riding public,” it added."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/714285/ltfrb-approves-uber-accreditation","title":"LTFRB approves Uber accreditation","date":"11:08 AM August 19, 2015","snippet":"","body":" The Land Transport Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has approved on Wednesday the application of online-based transportation service provider Uber as an accredited Transport Network Company (TNC).

In a statement, Uber said it sanctioned Anie Agbayani after Lesaca posted on Facebook the “bad experience” of his former wife and daughter who are both cancer patients.  At the same time, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it would hold a hearing on the incident on July 18. In a post on July 2, Lesaca said that normally, he would accompany both women to The Medical City but on June 30, he could not so his daughter booked a ride to the Pasig hospital from their house on Katipunan Avenue in Quezon City.  The trip, however, ended up badly for both women. At the corner of Greenmeadows and Ortigas Avenues, Agbayani told them to get out of the car, saying her house was nearby and she did not want to be stuck in heavy traffic for another 20 minutes. His ex-wife and daughter ended up having to walk to the hospital in the rain, Lesaca said. In a joint affidavit, both women said that at the start of their trip, they were already “stressed” out by Agbayani’s driving. They added that she drove “recklessly, kept on changing lanes” and even did a counterflow.  On top of this, Agbayani ate chips as she drove and sent voice messages on her cell phone, putting their lives “in danger,” they said. Lesaca said that his daughter and ex-wife were “stunned” by the behavior shown by Agbayani, who reasoned out that her knees were shaking since she had been driving since 4 a.m. In its statement, Uber apologized to the two women for their “unfavorable” experience as it assured its customers that it would continue “to deliver a safe, convenient and affordable ride.” Lesaca, however, said that they were bent on pressing their complaint against Agbayani, especially since his ex-wife and daughter “went home feeling very tired, weak, and mentally and physically drained” because of their experience. The LTFRB earlier issued a show cause order against Uber, asking it to explain why its accreditation should not be suspended on the grounds of Agbayani’s refusal to render service to the public or convey passengers to their destination. Other grounds were undercharging of fare (she charged the two women P300 instead of P389 as a compromise) and breaching franchise conditions by failing to provide safe and comfortable transportation."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/724660/transpo-group-claims-uber-grabcar-worsen-traffic-in-metro","title":"Transpo group claims Uber, GrabCar worsen traffic in Metro","date":"03:59 PM September 23, 2015","snippet":"A transport group composed of jeepney, taxi, and UV Express drivers is pushing for the suspension of the accreditation of mobile application-based ridesharing services Uber and GrabCar, as they claim these companies are contributing to the worsening traffic situation in Metro Manila.","body":"A transport group composed of jeepney, taxi, and UV Express drivers is pushing for the suspension of the accreditation of mobile application-based ridesharing services Uber and GrabCar, as they claim these companies are contributing to the worsening traffic situation in Metro Manila. Staging a rally outside the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) main office in Quezon City on Wednesday, members of Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations (ACTO) said that thousands of GrabCar and Uber are on the road due to the relatively easy procedures for their accreditation.  ACTO President Efren De Luna said that the relative ease of the accreditation process of said transportation network companies (TNCs) violates their rights as “legitimate” owners and operators of public utility vehicles who have franchises. “[Uber and GrabCar] contribute to worsening traffic and minimize our profit. Their accreditation is a violation of out rights as legitimate public utility vehicle owners and operators who hold franchise and are following the prescribed procedures. However, our rights have been disregarded by the LTFRB,” De Luna said in an interview with INQUIRER.net.  “Our problem is that there are too many cars on the road. But why is the LTFRB still accepting the application of thousands of GrabCar and Uber drivers?” he added. Meanwhile, De Luna claimed that the accreditation of the TNCs has sparked a more aggressive stance of the regulatory agency regarding the “phase-out” of PUVs.  He said that while drivers of PUVs are willing to “modernize” so that their service will be at par with the ones being provided by Uber and GrabCar drivers,  the “phase-out” of cars which are 10 years-old or older will pose as a threat to their livelihood. Citing data collated as of Sept. 23, the LTFRB said that it has received 3,903 units from TNCs and has received applications from 2,982 drivers for accreditation. There were more drivers wanting to be accredited under Uber than GrabCar: with 1,808 applications for Uber compared to 1,174 for GrabCar. JE"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/246339/uber-settles-p41b-unpaid-vat","title":"Uber settles P41.15M in unpaid VAT","date":"04:55 PM February 22, 2018","snippet":"Update","body":"Update Global peer-to-peer ridesharing and transportation network Uber Systems Inc. has settled P41.15 million in unpaid value-added taxes during the second half of 2016, preventing the closure of its Philippine operations, the Bureau of Internal Revenue said Thursday.  In a statement, the country’s biggest tax-collection agency said that it was supposed to suspend Uber’s local business operations under its “Oplan Kandado” program following an audit of the company’s VAT compliance for the period July 1 to Dec. 31, 2016. The investigation was made under a letter of authority issued by revenue officers of Revenue District Office No. 47, East Makati, Revenue Region No. 8, Makati City, the BIR said.  A letter of authority is an official document that empowers revenue officers to examine and scrutinize taxpayers’ books in order to determine their correct tax liabilities. “Records of investigation showed that Uber is registered with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) as a transportation network company (TNC) with a pool of transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) operators and drivers who use its transport system to get clients/passengers for transport from one place to another. It provides pre-arranged transportation services for a fee using an internet-based application or digital platform to connect passengers with drivers using personal vehicles. It likewise ensures the compliance of its TNVS operators and drivers with the LTFRB,” the BIR noted.  “As such TNC, all of Uber’s earnings are derived from the transportation services made by its TNVS operators and drivers within the Philippines. Hence, its gross receipts from such sale of services is subject to the 12-percent VAT and not to the 3-percent common carrier’s tax,” the BIR explained. “Although Uber religiously filed its VAT returns on time, it declared its sale of services rendered within the Philippines amounting to P413.85 million as zero-rated sales, contrary to the ‘cross border doctrine,’” the BIR said. According to the BIR, the cross border doctrine meant that “no VAT shall be imposed to form part of the cost of goods destined for consumption outside of the territorial border of the taxing authority.” “Conversely, those destined for use or consumption within the Philippines shall be imposed with the 12-percent VAT,” the BIR added. “The act of Uber of declaring its sale of services as zero-rated and not paying the VAT due thereon is a clear violation of the Tax Code which is one of the grounds for its suspension or temporary closure. Section 115 of the Tax Code, as implemented through Revenue Memorandum Order No. 03-2009, authorizes the BIR to suspend or close the business operations of a taxpayer for a period of not less than five days for failure to: register; issue VAT official receipts or sales invoices; file correct VAT returns; or pay the correct VAT,” according to the BIR. To avoid closure, Uber settled its unpaid VAT dues last Feb. 13."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248707/grab-uber-told-keep-apps","title":"Grab, Uber told to keep apps","date":"05:34 AM April 06, 2018","snippet":"The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has directed Grab and Uber to continue operating their apps independently despite the scheduled termination of the Uber app next week.","body":"The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has directed Grab and Uber to continue operating their apps independently despite the scheduled termination of the Uber app next week.

Kalanick disclosed Tuesday that he has sold off all his Uber stock — estimated at more than $2.5 billion — and is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties to the company he co-founded a decade ago.  “Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,” the 43-year-old entrepreneur said in a statement. Uber, based in San Francisco, transformed the way people get around and how they make a living, too, turbocharging the gig economy and undermining the taxi industry. Its nearly 4 million drivers around the globe have logged 15 billion trips since 2010, when Kalanick and Garrett Camp came up with the idea of hailing a ride from a smartphone after a trip to Paris when they couldn’t find a taxi.  But Kalanick was fired as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in lawsuits. Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, it ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be spinning out of control. Before his ouster as chief executive, Kalanick acknowledged he needed to “fundamentally change and grow up.”  His career at Uber seemed to fit a certain pattern seen in Silicon Valley: The brash and disruptive personalities who are great at creating startups can be ill-suited for the corner office when the company reaches maturity. Sometimes “adult supervision” in the form of experienced executives has to be brought in. In one of the Uber’s biggest scandals, Kalanick was accused of presiding over a workplace environment that allowed rampant sexual harassment. A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, leveled sexual harassment and sexism allegations in a 2017 blog post, saying a boss — not Kalanick — had propositioned her and higher-ups had ignored her complaints. Kalanick called the accusations “abhorrent” and hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate. Holder recommended reducing Kalanick’s responsibilities. After multiple investigations, Uber fired 20 employees accused of sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation against those who complained. This month, the company paid $4.4 million to settle a federal investigation over workplace misconduct. The problems went beyond employee relations.  Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, sued Uber in 2017, alleging a top manager at Google stole pivotal technology from the company before leaving to run Uber’s self-driving car division. Uber also gained a reputation under Kalanick for running roughshod over regulators, launching in markets before officials were able to draft rules and regulations to keep the ride-hailing business in check. During Kalanick’s tenure, The New York Times revealed that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber’s software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating. “Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror,” Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors. Kalanick, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed Tuesday. Kalanick is not alone among visionary tech entrepreneurs who have stumbled after building startups from nothing. Tesla founder Elon Musk has had too loose a grip on his Twitter habit and has been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors with a tweet. He was also sued for defamation, but ultimately cleared, for going on Twitter and calling a British cave explorer “pedo guy” — short for “pedophile.” Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, recently stepped aside after the workplace-sharing company canceled its initial public offering amid concerns about his judgment, including his use of WeWork stock to secure a $500 million personal loan. After Kalanick’s ouster, former Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought on as Uber’s chief executive to clean up its image and steer the company to its stock market debut in May. But Uber’s stock floundered and fell almost 11% in its first day of trading as a public company. It has tumbled more than 30% since. “Let’s call it like it is: Uber stock has been a nightmare since the IPO coming out of the gates,” Ives said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Kalanick had been one of Uber’s biggest shareholders, owning 9% of the company at the time of the IPO. Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research, said it was not surprising Kalanick sold his stake. “He, like everyone else, probably realizes now that Uber and its competitors are unlikely to reach sustainable profitability in the foreseeable future,” Abuelsamid said. “Automated vehicles are not the savior for ride hailing and won’t be mainstream for many years. With that in mind, his Uber stake is probably as valuable as it will get for a long time, if not forever.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/925785/uber-ltfrb-senator-grace-poe-fine-transportation-tnc-p190-million-fine-uber-philippines","title":"Poe questions LTFRB for late issuance of fine vs Uber","date":"01:42 PM August 26, 2017","snippet":"Imposing fine was a good move, but why issue it on a Friday afternoon before a long weekend?","body":"Imposing fine was a good move, but why issue it on a Friday afternoon before a long weekend?

The senator said the hefty fine “should be enough to make Uber rethink its actions and reevaluate its strategy in testing the extent of government regulations.” However, Poe expressed disappointment that the LTFRB decision came out late Friday afternoon ahead of a long weekend, “effectively taking out any opportunity for Uber to pay the penalties.”  “It is frustrating to think that we have a long weekend ahead of us and people will have to suffer the inconvenience of having limited transportation choices in going around the Metro with their families,” the senator said. “How will Uber be able to immediately comply with the LTFRB decision given that banks are closed during the weekend?” she added.

Uber Philippines said on Thursday that it sought the government’s approval to increase the fare per kilometer (km) of uberX rides by about 58 percent to 110 percent, depending on the time of the day.  Under its proposal, the fare per km would rise to P9 to P12 from the current rate of P5.70 per km. Unchanged were the uberX base fare and time charge of P40 and P2, respectively, the company said. The proposed increase, filed with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board today, would help Uber drivers recover part of their expenses, it noted.  “The costs that driver-partners have to bear to maintain their vehicles is projected to increase due to several factors, including requirements under the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines to further improve safety and quality of service, increasing fuel prices, and new excise taxes on petroleum,” Uber Philippines said. Under the newly enacted Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion law, gasoline will be subject to a higher excise tax of P7 per liter.  Grab, which is Uber’s main rival in the Philippines, earlier this month sought the LTFRB’s approval to increase its fare per km to P11 to P15. This is higher than the previous range of P10 per P14. It also sought the increase of its per-minute running charge from P2 to P2.10. Last October 2017, the LTFRB approved a fare increase for the taxi industry. The new structure involved a flag down rate of P40 for taxis in Metro Manila and a per kilometer rate of P13.50. Taxis also charge P2 per minute of running time."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/982843/as-uber-exits-grab-hit-by-complaints-about-high-rates","title":"As Uber exits, Grab hit by complaints about high rates","date":"05:05 AM April 17, 2018","snippet":"On the day Grab became the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry with Uber’s exit from the country, commuters complained about its exorbitant fares.","body":"On the day Grab became the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry with Uber’s exit from the country, commuters complained about its exorbitant fares. The transport network company (TNC), however, stressed that it was not taking advantage of the situation, explaining that its rates were still within the bounds approved by the government.  Still, Grab’s surge pricing during Monday’s morning rush hour shocked a lot of commuters who were forced to look for other forms of transport. One of them was Joyce Yu who chose to take a bus from North Avenue to Ortigas since Grab was charging her P450 for the trip which would normally cost just P250.  Disappointed passengers Several netizens also took to Twitter to express their disappointment over Grab’s high fares which ranged from P300 to P600.  A 6.5-kilometer trip from Makati to Manila at 8 a.m., for example, set riders back by almost P300 when hours earlier, the same trip cost only around P150. Last week, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Grab to “immediately” bring down its surge pricing cap from twice the regular rate to just 1.5 times while it was processing the accreditation of new TNCs that would take the place of Uber. According to Grab Philippines government communications manager Fiona Nicolas, while they have already implemented the new surge rate imposed by the LTFRB, fares may remain high in the meantime due to the limited number of drivers. “The onboarding of TNVS (transport network vehicle services) is not yet at 100 percent while most, if not all, Uber passengers have already downloaded the Grab app. The onboarding [of drivers] from Uber to Grab is still ongoing,” Nicolas said. Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu earlier explained that while there had been an increase of up to 70 percent in their passenger bookings, the number of drivers in their system rose only by around 30 percent.  Uber goes offline On Monday, the Uber app went offline in the country following Grab’s acquisition of its Southeast Asian operations under a March 25 deal. Uber’s move was also in compliance with the LTFRB’s directive for it to cease operating as a TNC starting April 16 despite an order from the Philippine Competition Commission that it continue serving the public pending a review of its deal with Grab. To protect the public from a hike in Grab fares, the National Center for Commuter Safety and Protection (NCCSP) called on the LTFRB to speed up its accreditation of new TNCs Lag Go, Hype and Owto. “It is incumbent on the LTFRB to approve these applications. We think that [the] LTFRB should hurry up so that there will be competition,” NCCSP head Maricor Akol said. At the same time, the LTFRB called on the public to report to it picky Grab drivers, including those who force passengers to cancel their bookings. It said that show cause orders would be issued against these drivers who would have to explain why their franchise to operate should not be revoked."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/856560/after-ltfrb-warning-grab-uber-put-cap-on-price-surges","title":"After LTFRB warning, Grab, Uber put cap on price surges","date":"12:40 AM December 26, 2016","snippet":"After being warned that they may lose their accreditation, ride-sharing services Uber and Grab complied with a government directive to address complaints over “price surges” this holiday season.","body":"After being warned that they may lose their accreditation, ride-sharing services Uber and Grab complied with a government directive to address complaints over “price surges” this holiday season. In response to a 48-hour ultimatum issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Uber implemented on Sunday a limit to its surge pricing.  In a statement, Uber said the limit would remain in effect up to Jan. 15, 2017, to allow passengers to avail themselves of “more affordable” rides. It called on the public to use the Uber app’s “Help” feature should they have any concerns regarding their trip.  Grab, meanwhile, committed to place a cap on its rates from Dec. 24 to Jan. 30 next year “to ensure that the riding public will get the best service and rates during this season.” It gave no further details,  however, as to how much the limit would be. The company reminded its passengers to “double check” their destination and pickup points before confirming their booking so they will not be charged incorrectly.  The LTFRB on Sunday thanked Grab for its “immediate action” on the matter. But in the case of Uber, the board earlier that day issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the transport network company (TNC) for it come up with measures that would prevent “unreasonable” price surges. The LTFRB then noted that the company “did not heed” the board’s earlier directive for the TNCs not to take advantage of the increased demand from commuters. The board earlier reminded them that it can suspend or cancel their accreditation should the complaints persist. This was after it received reports that riders had paid as much as P28,000 just for a single trip. Before Uber announced the price cap, a note published on the company website said the LTFRB should also make a move.  Discussions since July Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua pointed out that since the LTFRB suspended the application of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) in July, there have been discussions with the agency concerning ways to address the growing demand and avoid price surges caused by the lack of vehicles. “We have seen increasing demand for Uber rides this holiday season, yet vehicle availability remained stagnant. We are optimistic that the LTFRB will soon lift the suspension on new TNVS applications, allowing more people to enjoy safe, reliable and affordable rides in the Philippines,” Cua said. Mounting complaints over price surges first became a concern for the LTFRB in September last year, particularly after a stormy night in Metro Manila when flash floods paralyzed traffic and rides became scarce in many parts of the capital. The LTFRB on Sunday renewed its call to the public to report any violation committed not only by TNCs but also by taxi drivers to the board’s 24/7 hotline 1342 or mobile numbers 09175501342 and 09985501342.

After imposing a P5-million fine on ride-sharing companies Grab and Uber, the LTFRB said that by July 26, drivers face P120,000 in fine and their vehicles would be impounded for at least three months if found to be operating without a certificate of public conveyance or provisional license from the agency.  The LTFRB action came after agency officials met with representatives of the ride-hailing companies Uber, Grab and U-Hop on Tuesday. During the meeting, Grab and Uber representatives admitted they listed thousands of accredited drivers in their databases despite these drivers not having franchises to operate from the LTFRB.  In its new order on Tuesday, the LTFRB told the ride-hailing company representatives to “cease with dispatch” the operations of these drivers by July 26. Drivers claiming to be affiliated with Grab and Uber but without LTFRB franchises would be apprehended.  Aileen Lizada, LTFRB board member, said drivers with expired franchises but had applied for renewal would be allowed to continue using their cars as public conveyances. Lizada said they ordered the ride-hailing companies to submit before the end of the month their updated list of accredited drivers. Based on the LTFRB records, only more than 3,700 app-based drivers had been authorized to operate. But representatives said Grab and Uber had accredited at least 56,000 drivers. The LTFRB had wanted to revoke the accreditation of Grab and Uber because of several violations. Among these was the failure of the ride-hailing firms to screen drivers before endorsement to the LTFRB and the accreditation of drivers who don’t have franchises to use their cars as public conveyances. But because Grab and Uber serve a significant segment of the commuter population, the two were just fined P5 million, according to Lizada.  Also because more and more vehicles are packing Metro Manila’s already congested roads, the LTFRB asked the ride-hailing firms to help set a limit on the number of privately owned cars that should be allowed to be used as public conveyances. Of the 9.25 million registered cars in the entire country, 2.4 million are in the metropolis. —Jovic Yee"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/744754/qcrtc-stops-operations-of-uber-grabcar-for-20-days","title":"QCRTC stops DOTC, LTFRB from issuing permits to operate Uber, GrabCar","date":"12:09 PM December 04, 2015","snippet":"The Quezon City Regional Trial Court 217 has stopped for 20 days the accepting, processing and approval of permits to operate Uber and GrabCar operations under Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) without a certificate of public convenience (CPC).","body":"The Quezon City Regional Trial Court 217 has stopped for 20 days the accepting, processing and approval of permits to operate Uber and GrabCar operations under Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) without a certificate of public convenience (CPC). In a nine-page order, QCRTC Judge Santiago Arenas issued the 20-day restraining order against the implementation of Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) Department Order No. 2015-11, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Memorandum Circulars Memorandum Circulars 2015-15, 16, 17 and 18 and other issuances related to TNVS.  The said issuances pertain to accreditation, conditions and implementing guidelines to operate TNVS. DOTC, under DO 2015-11, was amended to promote mobility and encourage innovations in public transport.  The restraining order was granted in favor of Angat Tsuper Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator ng Pilipinas Genuine Organizatio  TransportCoalition (Stop & Go). In their petition, they assailed TNVS for being able to operate even without a CPC unlike other modes of transport like taxi.  CPC is an authorization issued for the operation of public services for which no franchise, either municipal or legislative, is required by law, such as a common carrier. Petitioner said what the car owners have to do is simply secure a membership from Transportation Network Companies (TNC), equip themselves with the necessary technology and can already operate once given a provisional authority. The petitioners blamed such an easy procedure for the increase in car sales, heavy traffic and decline in income of taxi operators and drivers. “This resulted in the increase in sales of cars and other motor vehicles… This could be one of the reasons of the present heavy traffic in the metropolis,” petitioner said. They also added that TNC and TNVS could be the reason for LTFRB’s continued denial of their application for CPCs.  The court said initial findings showed that Stop & Go met the requisites for a temporary restraining order including establishing a material invasion of their rights to operate public utility vehicles and grave and irreparable injury and damage specifically to their income “due to sudden uncontrolled increase in TNVS utility running the streets of Metro Manila.” With the restraining order, the court stopped DOTC and LTFRB from accepting, processing and approving applications from TNVS. The court set a hearing on Dec. 8 to determine if the restraining order will be made permanent or not.

In an order issued to the two TNCs, the LTFRB limited the maximum allowable fare price surge to “twice the rates for time covered and distance traveled, excluding the base fare.”  Under this computation, the surge price for a 10-kilometer ride lasting for an hour should cost an Uber passenger only P348. A Grab passenger taking the same route will spend a minimum of P200 (Grab Sedan) to at most P280 (Grab Premium). This is on top of the base fare of TNCs, which will not be affected by surge pricing. Grab’s base fare is P30 while its premium service is at P70. UberX charges a base fare of P40 while UberBlack is at P90.  The LTFRB also directed Grab to lower its fare per km rate from between P12 and P16 to P10-P14, depending on the type of vehicle used. Earlier, several commuters complained to the LTFRB about the unreasonable surge prices being charged by the TNCs—as much as P28,000 for one ride.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that their order would be in effect until they come out with a memorandum circular. The TNCs have been given 10 days to submit their position paper on issues such as their liability, accountability and reasonable determination of fares."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/691221/regular-cab-operators-eye-lawsuit-over-uber","title":"‘Regular’ cab operators eye lawsuit over Uber","date":"05:32 AM May 14, 2015","snippet":"“Traditional” taxi cab owners are up in arms over the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) order allowing smartphone ridesharing applications like Uber, Grabcab, East Taxi and Tripda to legally operate in the Philippines.","body":"“Traditional” taxi cab owners are up in arms over the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) order allowing smartphone ridesharing applications like Uber, Grabcab, East Taxi and Tripda to legally operate in the Philippines. According to Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, they may file a case against the DOTC and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for not taking into consideration the impact of letting Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) operate in the country.  “We are now relegated to second choice,” Suntay said on Wednesday as the DOTC released the order legitimizing the operations of smartphone ridesharing applications. The move also marked the first time a country created a framework to accommodate technology transit services, according to an Uber official. The DOTC order outlined the new classifications, including those covering the so-called Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) like Uber, Grabcar, Easy Taxi and Tripda.  In an earlier interview, Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya had said the move would allow TNC “to exist within our regulatory framework” while the LTFRB would be able to start finalizing a memorandum circular outlining specific regulations and requirements for the TNVS and their drivers. “This is to merely offer better services to compel them (traditional taxi cabs) to modernize and compete,” Abaya had said, adding: “People will get to choose whether they want to use the older taxis or TNVS.”  “We shouldn’t look at this as added competition or to destroy the [traditional] taxi industry,” he told reporters. Suntay disagreed, saying the move would ultimately hurt their business. He said the transit application platforms have an unfair advantage over “regular” cabs since the former do not operate their own cars. He said that services like Uber, which provides a platform for a passenger to link up with a private car driver, also benefit because their fares are not regulated unlike regular cabs. “We are a business entity, we have a big investment in our companies,” Suntay said, adding that they have asked the government to mitigate the impact on their business like limiting the types of cars TNCs can register to larger and more premium vehicle models. The DOTC is also imposing certain standards for vehicle eligibility, such as the requirement of global positioning system tracking and navigation devices for convenient and safer services. In addition, only sedans, Asian utility vehicles, SUVs, vans or other similar vehicles will be accredited. Operators will also be required to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience for every vehicle to ensure accountability, the DOTC said. To promote passenger safety, drivers must be screened and accredited by the TNC and registered with the  LTFRB, it added. Representatives of ridesharing applications welcomed the news even as some acknowledged that several details needed to be ironed out with LTFRB, including the regulation of fares which some ridesharing applications currently dictate. Still, they underscored the current collaborative environment in the Philippines. “Today, the Philippines has officially become the first country to create a national dedicated framework for ridesharing,” David Plouffe, senior vice president of policy and strategy at Uber, said in an e-mailed statement."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/951794/uber-charges-passenger-over-18k-for-five-mile-ride-later-apologizes-for-error","title":"Uber charges passenger over C$18K for 5-mile ride, later apologizes for error","date":"07:05 PM December 12, 2017","snippet":"One Uber passenger will surely remember this ride after paying a hefty price for it.","body":"One Uber passenger will surely remember this ride after paying a hefty price for it.

The usual cost of the trip would have been around $12-$16.

When asked about the authenticity of the post, Kennard replied that the transport service was not backing down and refused to refund her friend. Upon the circulation of the tweet, many netizens vented their shock and frustration towards the surge of the trip’s cost, with some accusing Uber of ripping off the passenger. After the incident, a spokesperson for Uber issued a statement saying that there was an error found and it had been resolved. “We have provided a full refund to this rider and apologized to him for this experience. We have safeguards in place to help prevent something like this from happening, and we are working to understand how this occurred,” the statement read.

During a hearing on Wednesday on Uber’s alleged violation of the agency’s July 26 order, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada told the company’s representatives that the board’s personnel were able to register and include three cars on the Uber platform within an hour using a mobile phone.  On July 26, the LTFRB told TNCs Grab and Uber that “no further acceptance of additional accreditation of TNVS (transport network vehicles services) and/or activation of their accounts into (your) respective systems shall be allowed, effective immediately.” On Tuesday, the board ordered Uber officials to appear in the hearing on the alleged violation. Later that day, the company issued a statement explaining that “applications for vehicles are beingaccepted but not processed.”  At Wednesday’s proceedings, Uber legal counsel Joseph Castillo maintained that the company had made it “clear in the communication packages” given to new drivers that “activations will not happen even if we accepted” their applications. But Lizada showed Castillo how the LTFRB itself was able to obtain an account through the web portal used by Uber drivers. She said the agency over the weekend was able to add a car into the newly created account at 2:20 p.m. and have it activated at 2:58 p.m.  “What I find difficult to comprehend is that your partners can add vehicles into their accounts inside the confines of their room,” Lizada said. “I wonder how many operators are now putting vehicles in their respective accounts because this can be another way [to] circumvent [our orders].” Castillo said he would have to go back to Uber to determine if the “active” status of a car in the account meant that the drivers could already use the vehicle. LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III acknowledged that while TNCs are “ahead in terms of technology,” they still need to comply with government regulations. “[The] acceptance for accreditation [has] to stop precisely because we’re trying to address false expectations of prospective TNVS to get themselves accredited, or worse activated or get a booking,” he said. Lizada stressed that the board’s two meetings with Uber and Grab last month were done “in good faith to find an equilibrium” in addressing concerns of the ride-sharing industry. “We hope Uber will be patient enough to wait and be compliant. That’s all that we’re asking,” she said. The board has given Uber five days to submit a written explanation why its accreditation, set to expire this month, should not be cancelled in view of the alleged violation."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/270509/uber-hits-fresh-headwinds-as-shares-extend-losses","title":"Uber hits fresh headwinds as shares extend losses","date":"04:00 PM May 14, 2019","snippet":"NEW YORK — Uber shares went into a fresh skid Monday — more bad news for the global ride-hailing giant, which endured steep declines in its hotly anticipated market debut last week.","body":"NEW YORK — Uber shares went into a fresh skid Monday — more bad news for the global ride-hailing giant, which endured steep declines in its hotly anticipated market debut last week. Shares in Uber tumbled 10.75 percent to close at $37.10 on the second day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  Valued at some $82 billion in one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) in the technology sector, Uber’s debut Friday was a major disappointment, losing 7.6 percent. The two-day meltdown left the Silicon Valley star with a cumulative loss of more 17.5 percent while ride-hailing rival Lyft has plunged 33 percent since its March debut.  Jay Ritter, a University of Florida professor of finance specializing in IPOs, said it was highly unusual for a high-profile company like Uber to fall so quickly.   “But it’s a very difficult company to value, and I expect that there will be big upswings and downswings in the future,” Ritter said. Still, Ritter said the rocky opening is not necessarily an indication of the long-term value of Uber. “If a year from now its value goes up to $100 billion people will be no longer talking about the first two days of trading,” he said. ‘Remember Facebook’ Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi urged employees to look past the rough patch on Wall Street and stay focused on better days ahead, according to an internal email obtained by AFP.  “Remember that the Facebook and Amazon post-IPO trading was incredibly difficult for those companies,” Khosrowshahi said in the message. “And look at how they have delivered since. Our road will be the same.” He noted that Monday was a tough day for the stock market overall, not just for the San Francisco-based ride-share company with visions of becoming the “Amazon of transportation.” Khosrowshahi acknowledged that there were versions of Uber’s future in which the company does not prosper as hoped, but warned against being distracted by pessimistic voices in the market. “Sentiment does not change overnight, and I expect some tough public market times over the coming months,” he said in the email. “We will be judged long-term on our performance, and I welcome that.” Troubled road ahead Richard Windsor, an analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog on technology, said Uber and Lyft have been pressured by their high valuations and intense competition. Uber and Lyft “are currently engaged in a life or death struggle to become the dominant ridesharing platform in the USA,” Windsor said. “Until this fight is settled, there is very little reason to invest in either company as while they slug it out rock bottom prices and incentives for drivers will continue to plague profitability.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Lyft shares Monday fell nearly six percent to $48.15, extending the steady decline for Uber’s smaller US rival. Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said he expected the “valuation digestion process” to take some time and that he remained upbeat on Uber despite competition with Lyft and the long path to profitability. “We believe there is a large enough ocean for two boats as the ridesharing market domestically in the US is roughly $1.2 trillion and $5.7 trillion globally,” Ives said. “We expect ridership, drivers, and the monetization opportunities for Uber to increase markedly over the coming years. A core tenet of our bull thesis on Uber is around the company’s ability to morph its unrivaled ridesharing platform into a broader consumer engine.” Uber and Lyft face additional troubles, highlighted by last week’s protests from some drivers in the US, and regulatory roadblocks in many parts of the world. Thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers turned off their apps in a US-wide strike last week over revenue-sharing formulas and working conditions. Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/791497/transport-group-sues-abaya-for-allowing-uber-grabcar-to-operate","title":"Transport group sues Abaya for allowing Uber, Grabcar to operate","date":"03:44 PM June 20, 2016","snippet":"(Updated) A public transportation group on Monday filed a graft complaint against outgoing Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chief Winston Ginez for allowing the operation of Uber and Grabcar allegedly without a franchise.","body":"(Updated) A public transportation group on Monday filed a graft complaint against outgoing Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chief Winston Ginez for allowing the operation of Uber and Grabcar allegedly without a franchise. Jun Magno of the Angat Tsuper Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator ng Pilipinas Genuine Organization Transport Coalition (Stop & Go) filed the complaint against the two for allowing the operation of transportation network vehicle service (TNVS), such as Uber, Grabcar and U-Hop, without securing a franchise as required by law.  Magno said Abaya and Ginez approved a Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) order in 2015 which allows for “innovation across all forms of public land transport” to increase mobility, improve public transport and “respond to the needs of the modern commuter.” The department order allowed for the operation of TNVS even without securing a certificate of public convenience, Magno said.  Magno said the officials committed graft for giving undue advantage to Uber, Grabcar and U-Hop to the disadvantage of taxi operators and public utility vehicle drivers who lose income and passengers because of the influx of TNVS. He added that the influx of vehicles operating as TNVS worsened traffic in the metropolis.  “Even before the issuance of the respondents of the said department order and memorandum circulars, it already deeply affected the rights of the complainants’ officers and members being concerned citizens, taxpayers, operators and drivers of public utility vehicles. Many taxi drivers transferred to TNVS as they could allegedly have relatively good income, passengers of taxis and AUV express decreased tremendously as commuting public tried the use of TNVS resulting to loss of income of operators and drivers of these taxis and AUV express,” the complaint read. The complainant said only accreditations were issued to TNVS for provisional authority to ply the routes of the metro. He said these service vehicles were not yet issued a franchise, which is given only after going through a series of hearings and submitting requirements. Abaya and Ginez also allegedly committed graft when they caused undue injury to government by allowing TNVS to pay a measly amount of P520 application fee to operate, compared to a much heftier cost for taxi operators to obtain a franchise. Magno added that the officials allowed the TNVS to operate even without the guidelines from Congress as required for under the department order.  “No guidance was issued by the legislative branch of government… The transportation network companies (TNC) were only accredited but not to operate. Therefore, the operations of the TNVS including the TNCs are illegal,” the complaint read. In a statement, Ginez said Magno resorted to forum shopping after the Quezon city Regional Trial Court junked his plea for an injunction against the implementation of the department order allowing operations for Uber and Grabcar. He said Magno’s complaint has no basis and that the department order allowing for Uber and Grabcar to operate is consistent with existing laws. “The filing of a complaint against me and Secretary Abaya for allegedly allowing the operation of Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), such as Uber and Grab, is a desperate move by Mr. Magno of Stop & Go. After failing to convince the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in granting his prayer for injunction against DOTC and LTFRB in implementing the Department Order and Memorandum Circulars creating TNVS as a new mode of public transportation, Mr. Magno is resorting to pernicious act of forum shopping to dissuade us from providing our commuting public with safe, reliable, convenient and comfortable transportation that is sanctioned by our existing transportation laws,” Ginez said. “We are confident that just like the RTC of Quezon City, the Ombudsman will reject the baseless and unfounded allegations of Mr. Magno,” he added. JE/rga RELATED STORIES QC court junks plea to halt app-based vehicle service Court denies group’s bid to extend TRO on Uber, GrabCar permits"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/946988/uber-ph-execs-summoned-over-passenger-data-breach","title":"Uber PH execs summoned over passenger data breach","date":"06:25 AM November 23, 2017","snippet":"Officials of Uber Philippines have been summoned by the National Privacy Commission (NPC) to explain if any information from their local  users was compromised in a massive breach the company experienced last year.","body":"Officials of Uber Philippines have been summoned by the National Privacy Commission (NPC) to explain if any information from their local  users was compromised in a massive breach the company experienced last year.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) monitored the market before and after Uber ended its Philippine operations in April, following Grab’s regional acquisition of Uber in March.  “Results of the market investigation, as well as comments from the riding public on the effects of the Transaction submitted to the Office, indicate that the quality of services of Grab has decreased post-Transaction in the following manner: (i) increased driver cancellation; (ii) forced cancellation of rides; and (iii) increased waiting times,” the PCC statement of concerns noted. “This is compounded by the loss of a competitor in Uber where trips were less likely to be cancelled due to features which mask the destination of a prospective rider until the start of a trip,” it also stated.  The PCC’s statement of concerns was published on Monday. It is part of PCC’s ongoing review of the Grab-Uber deal, wherein the watchdog could approve, block, or allow the transaction while imposing conditions to address anti-competitive concerns. However, even in the absence of a verdict, the statement of concerns issued by PCC’s Mergers and Acquisitions Office (MAO) hinted that the market has already become problematic after the Grab-Uber deal.  Higher fares after Uber’s exit After Uber left the market last month, Grab imposed higher fares and more frequent surge-pricing “despite an increase in the supply of Grab drivers,” PCC said, noting Grab now has a 93 percent hold of the market after Uber drivers switched apps. The antitrust body based the post-acquisition price increase on more than 27,000 booking requests and 1,100 rides surveyed before and after Uber’s exit on April 16. PCC said the surveys gathered information on the actual prices, service, and booking conditions of Grab and its potential competitors. The deal has “resulted and will likely continue to result in substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market,” PCC said. Moreover, PCC found out that transport network companies (TNCs) such as Grab cater to a captive market, “an overwhelming majority” of whom would still choose to book a ride despite price increases.  Not enough market pressure against Grab Amid pressure to allow more players in the market, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) have so far accredited five TNCs. PCC, however, said that historical data shows that it would require “a significant amount of time and cost” to grow their operations that would be enough to contest Grab. “During such period, Grab will not be constrained by any competitor, allowing it to exercise its market power in the relevant market. Therefore, the [MAO] finds that new entrants in the relevant market are not likely to exert sufficient competitive pressure on Grab,” PCC said. The parties involved have 10 days to comment on the PCC-MAO’s statement of concerns. A representative from PCC said that Grab and Uber received their copies on May 23. Conflict with LTFRB order In April, PCC tried to keep Grab from flexing its muscles in the unchecked market by imposing some interim measures. However, this became more difficult after the LTFRB stepped in. The PCC imposed those interim measures on Grab and Uber prior the release of the statement of concerns to keep the findings of the review accurate. Those interim measures included the resumption of independent and separate operations for the time being. Scheduled to end its services on April 8, Uber, at the time, agreed to extend the availability of its app until April 15, given the ongoing PCC review. Grab-Philippines, on the other hand, had said it shouldered the costs of Uber’s one week extension. However, following the release of PCC’s interim measures, the LTFRB slapped Uber with a cease-and-desist order, requiring the firm to stop its operations on April 15."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/922685/uber-suspended-one-month-ltfrb-tnvs","title":"LTFRB suspends Uber for 1 month","date":"05:15 PM August 14, 2017","snippet":"","body":" The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has suspended for a month the operations of transport network company (TNC) Uber after it defied its July 26 order not to accept and activate new drivers into its platform.  In response, Uber issued a short statement, saying: “Uber received an order around 6 p.m. tonight (August 14) to completely stop operations. We are studying the order at the moment. We will update our riders and drivers as soon as we can.” In its cease-and-desist order that was released and took effect on Monday night, the LTFRB said that Uber was “irresponsible” when it continued to accept and activate new drivers into its platform.  It noted that what the TNC has done was “not about pushing innovation in the context of fair regulation,” but “unduly challenging the limit of fair regulation to continue to engage in business in this country.” “The objective of the board now is to strike a gentle balance between innovation and the law for the public good… What takes precedence then? No doubt, it is the law. The law which defines fair and suitable regulation is the great equalizer in addressing and fulfilling the common good,” the order read.  Recognizing that their order meant that thousands of Uber’s drivers would lose income for a month, the LTFRB recommended that Uber extend financial assistance to its affected drivers as a “form of good faith.” “[T]heir accredited peer-operators would not have suffered the current predicament were it not for the predatory actions of [Uber],” it said. On July 26, the LTFRB ordered TNCs Grab and Uber to stop their acceptance and accreditation of new drivers as the agency ironed out issues concerning the ride-sharing industry. However, the LTFRB found out that Uber defied its order, with the TNC even releasing a statement that partly read that “applications are being accepted but not processed” by them. On top of this, the LTFRB was also able to activate three of its cars into Uber’s platform. In its hearing early this month, the LTFRB maintained that it was clear in its order that no applications should be received by the TNCs to “avoid raising false expectations” among drivers that they may engage in the public transportation service.  During the recent congressional hearing on the ride-sharing industry, Uber said that it has to date accredited around 66,000 vehicles into its platform. The board said that it recognized that the service provided by TNCs to the commuting public was “undeniably positive and beneficial.’ It noted though that “technological innovation is but a tool to enhance human convenience but may not dictate what may be morally acceptable social human behavior.” /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/270407/uber-lyft-losses-keep-competitors-at-bay","title":"Uber, Lyft losses keep competitors at bay","date":"02:48 PM May 12, 2019","snippet":"SAN FRANCISCO — A fare war between Uber and Lyft has led to billions of dollars in losses for both ride-hailing companies as they fight for passengers and drivers.","body":"SAN FRANCISCO — A fare war between Uber and Lyft has led to billions of dollars in losses for both ride-hailing companies as they fight for passengers and drivers. But in one way it has been good for investors who snatched up the newly public companies’ stock: The losses have scared off the competition, giving the leaders a duopoly in almost every American city.  READ: Uber, Lyft drivers protest, go on strike across the US, overseas The two San Francisco companies have already lost a combined $13 billion. And with no clear road to profits ahead, no one else has much of an incentive to mount a challenge using the same model relying on people driving their own cars to pick up passengers that summon them on a smartphone app, said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.  Even if another rival dared enter the market, it would likely be difficult to raise enough money to pose a viable threat after Uber and Lyft spent the past decade pulling in billions of dollars from venture capitalists. And in the past six weeks, they raised an additional $10.4 billion in their recently completed initial public offerings of stock. “There’s only a duopoly because both companies have enough capital to compete with each other and no one else does,” said Gartner analyst Michael Ramsey.  It’s likely to remain that way until any of dozens of companies trying to create self-driving cars refines their technology so they can launch a network of robotic taxis that removes human drivers from the equation. That breakthrough could enable them to slash their fares below the prices currently being charged by Uber and Lyft. Google spin-off Waymo has made no secret of its intention to muscle its way into the ride-hailing market with a fleet of self-driving cars built on technology that it has been working on for the past decade. Waymo launched a ride-hailing service with robotic vans in the Phoenix area five months ago, but only 1,000 people are currently allowed to use it. Besides being on the leading edge of bringing robotic vehicles to market, Waymo also is backed by more money than Uber and Lyft have combined. Waymo is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., which is sitting on $113 billion in cash. In its IPO document, Uber listed Waymo as a potential threat along with Tesla, General Motors’ Cruise Automation and Apple. Lyft also cited Waymo and Apple among the companies that could undercut its position as the second largest ride-hailing service. But most experts believe it will still be many more years before self-driving car technology reaches the point that it can support a large fleet of robotaxis.  Until then, the U.S. duopoly is likely to continue, giving Uber and Lyft the luxury of focusing on growth rather than turning a profit, analysts said. That means ride-hailing fares in the U.S. are likely to remain below the actual cost of providing the service, a boon for consumers. “These subsidies will continue as long as each company believes they will be gaining new customers by having a lower price,” says Alejandro Ortiz, principal analyst at SharesPost. “The story now is growth, but growth is expensive.” Eventually, though, investor pressure will mount on the companies to make money, and doing that almost certainly will require higher prices for their rides. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi hinted that it will be three to five years before the company pivots to a focus on profit. That timetable hasn’t been well received on Wall Street so far. Lyft’s stock has fallen 29% below its IPO price of six weeks ago, and Uber flopped in its stock market debut Friday as its shares slipped by almost 8% percent. Markets with only one or two dominant players often create situations for companies to abuse their power or attempt to stifle competition. Regulators and legislators around the world argue that’s already happened in many corners of technology, with Facebook having a seemingly impenetrable stronghold in social networking, Google dominating search and Amazon controlling a wide swath of online shopping. That has stirred calls to break up some of the companies, especially Facebook, whose own co-founder, Chris Hughes, recently argued his former company has become too powerful for society’s good. For now, Uber and Lyft have been drawing upon all the money that they have raised from investors to keep prices relatively low, creating a barrier for smaller-scale competitors without the capital to sustain massive losses. Take Austin, Texas, for instance. In 2016, Uber and Lyft pulled out of the city after voters approved regulations on ride-hailing companies, including fingerprint background checks for drivers. Four competitors stepped in to give rides in tech-savvy Austin, including two local companies. But the following year, Texas legislators passed a looser state law that superseded Austin’s, and Uber and Lyft came back. Shortly after their return, three of the competitors, Boston-based Fasten, locally owned GetMe and Phoenix-based Fare stopped operations, and the remaining one, nonprofit RideAustin, lost thousands of its riders. “It was a matter of a couple months and those three companies were gone,” said Chris Simek, an associate research scientist with the Texas A&M University Transportation Institute, who co-authored a study of Uber and Lyft’s impact on ride-hailing in Austin.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Uber hasn’t been as successful thwarting competition outside the U.S. It has waved a white flag during the past three years in Russia , China and parts of Southeast Asia by selling its services in those parts of the world to stronger rivals.Lyft has not expanded outside North America yet, so it faces few other competitors besides Uber in the U.S. Via has managed to carve out a niche by running a pooled ride system in New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago, and it contracts to provide transit in about 70 cities worldwide. It competes most directly in New York, where Uber and Lyft also offer pooled services that transport multiple riders. Via specializes in carrying up to six passengers at a time, largely in vans, and is growing because it can do a more efficient job carrying more people, said spokeswoman Gabrielle McCaig. Still, the company is losing money as it invests in growing the business, she said. And so it remains, at least for now, that Uber and Lyft will occupy the ride-hailing industry’s driver’s seat. “It is hard to see a third or fourth player coming in at this point,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom White. “I think we are looking at a duopoly in North America.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/841222/denr-exec-uber-driver-harassed-my-daughter-asked-for-movie-date","title":"DENR exec: Uber driver harassed my daughter, asked for movie date","date":"01:53 AM November 05, 2016","snippet":"A ranking government official is threatening to press charges against an Uber driver who allegedly harassed his daughter during a ride in Quezon City.","body":"A ranking government official is threatening to press charges against an Uber driver who allegedly harassed his daughter during a ride in Quezon City. Assistant Secretary Rommel Abesamis of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) vented his anger in a press conference on Friday, a day after his 20-year-old daughter’s alleged ordeal.  According to Abesamis, he booked his daughter with Uber around 1 p.m. on Thursday and she was later picked up by a silver Mitsubishi Mirage along Mindanao Avenue. Both he and his daughter, however, could only identify the driver as “Juanito.” Too personal  Later that afternoon, Abesamis said, his daughter complained to him that the driver kept asking her questions and “got too personal” during the ride. Juanito, he said, asked about her family and where she studies, and even wondered if he could apply as their family driver, all while munching peanuts and offering her some.  “He also asked my daughter out on a movie (date) and told her that a beauty like her should make a lot of babies,” Abesamis told reporters. Abesamis said that should he fail to get Uber’s “cooperation” on the matter, he would ask the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to revoke the franchise it granted to the transport network company. Joining Abesamis in the press briefing, Ariel Inton, a former LTFRB board member and founder of the group Lawyers for Commuters’ Safety and Protection, said that when Abesamis managed to contact Juanito on Thursday afternoon, the driver already apologized for what he did. Driver changes tone But when a son of Abesamis called the driver again on Friday, the driver changed his tone, threatened to “confront” them and even challenged them to sue him.  Inton said they would ask the Land Transportation Office to revoke the driver’s license  and also the LTFRB to check if the driver met the requirements to operate as an Uber partner. They would also file criminal charges against the driver for violating a Quezon City ordinance against harassing women, he added. Inton said this was the 10th complaint he had encountered concerning an Uber driver."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/923146/ltfrb-stands-ground-tells-uber-not-to-use-public-convenience-as-excuse","title":"LTFRB stands ground, tells Uber not to use public convenience as excuse","date":"12:53 PM August 16, 2017","snippet":"Do not use public convenience as an excuse to defy orders.","body":"Do not use public convenience as an excuse to defy orders. This was the message of the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Body (LTFRB) to Uber as it reminded on Wednesday the transport network company (TNC) that it is the regulatory body following the company’s “clear defiance” of the agency’s order not to accredit new drivers and cars into its platform.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada defended the agency’s decision to suspend Uber operations despite online criticisms from the public. “They say it’s for the convenience of the riding public. Uber keeps on saying convenience, convenience… pero [but], sir, it does not [equate] to allowing them to violate the law, even the orders of the Board,” Lizada said in an interview with DZIQ Radyo Inquirer 990.  “So kailangan lagyan ng preno [we need to put the brakes on], let them know who is the regulatory body, who regulates [whom]. We are here to execute the law. ‘Yun naman talaga ginagawa namin (That’s what we have been doing all along),” she added. READ: LTFRB: Uber still suspended  Lizada said that Uber did not comply with the LTFRB’s July 26 order disallowing the accreditation of new drivers and cars into TNCs’ platforms. On July 27, the LTFRB was able to enroll three vehicles into Uber’s system by just going to its website. “Doon namin nadiscover na pwede palang mag-add ng vehicles even kung nasa bahay ang kanilang mga partners (That’s when we discovered that one can add vehicles even at the comfort of one’s home) without necessarily going through their offices,” she explained. Uber also issued a statement on August 1 that it continued to accept applications for new vehicles, the official noted. “So ibig sabihin, [it is a] clear defiance of the July 26 order. That’s why we say that it is time that Uber takes another hit kasi it appears na hindi sila nadala sa fine (because it appears that they did not learn from being fined),” she said. LTFRB previously fined Uber, as well as Grab, with P5-million fee for illegal operations. However, the official said that the agency cannot do this every time Uber violates the law, despite the pressure from the public, including senators, to fine the company.  READ: Poe says Uber also at fault, but insists LTFRB suspension order too severe “We [ordered a] suspension hoping that Uber will clip its wings and follow regulations because it’s been soaring, parang ayaw magparegulate (it seems they do not want to be regulated),” Lizada said.

Citing reports he received, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chair Danilo Lim said on Thursday that the traffic situation eased by about five percent.  However, it still has much room for improvement, he added. “Based on what we’ve heard, it seems traffic improved slightly. Because the problem really in Metro Manila is [volume] of vehicles,” Lim said in a press briefing at Malacañang.  While the number of vehicles has been increasing, the road network has not expanded at a similar rate, he told reporters. “Of course, our traffic situation is still bad, but [Uber’s suspension] helped in some way,” Lim said.  The LTFRB suspended Uber’s operations starting on Aug. 15 for defying its order to stop accrediting and accepting more drivers pending a review of regulations on transport network companies like Uber and Grab. Uber, which has some 66,000 drivers in its network, has a pending petition to lift its one-month suspension and in exchange, it would pay a P10 million fine. The suspension affected only about 40 percent of Uber’s drivers since 60 percent of them were at the same time registered with Grab, LTFRB chair Martin Delgra said earlier. The LTFRB has also allowed Uber drivers to migrate to other ride-sharing services. Asked about adding more taxis on the road which the LTFRB was considering, Lim said he would support it if the agency thought it was the right thing to do.  “What is important is whether they are taxis or Uber or Grab, that they follow the impositions of LTFRB,” he added. Lim also said the government was on the right track in implementing a massive infrastructure project, including improving the country’s road network. At the same time, the MMDA was making sure to impose road discipline and enforce laws to improve the traffic situation."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/242468/uber-offers-traffic-tech-apps-govt","title":"Uber offers traffic tech apps to gov’t","date":"05:14 AM December 14, 2017","snippet":"Ridesharing giant Uber is opening up one of its technology solutions to the government to help in determining the traffic impact and benefits of the massive land infrastructure projects in the pipeline.","body":"Ridesharing giant Uber is opening up one of its technology solutions to the government to help in determining the traffic impact and benefits of the massive land infrastructure projects in the pipeline. Uber said it had made available data from its platform dubbed Movement to the Department of Public Works and Highways. Among its earliest recommendations was to support the proposed extension of San Miguel Corp.’s Naia Expressway (NAIAx) project to Bonifacio Global City in Taguig.  “Movement uses the power of big data to help government officials and planners understand the impact to travel times of the infrastructure projects and programs they roll out,” Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said in a statement. The solution uses data from thousands of trips both months before and after NAIAx was opened in June last year. Uber said the expressway shortened average travel times in and around the areas it serves.  Based on Uber’s estimates, Cua said the NAIAx extension would cut travel time between BGC and NAIAx in Entertainment City or the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) complex to about 20 minutes from 40 minutes. Cu said the Movement platform could also help government planners determine improvements in travel times once the BGC-Ortigas Center link, the proposed bridge between Binondo and Intramuros and the Skyway Stage 3 were completed.  SMC, a food and drinks giant that has diversified into infrastructure, earlier revealed that complete detailed engineering plans for the extension of the 7.7-kilometer NAIAx project going to BGC have been submitted to the government. SMC said the project would decongest Magallanes and the Edsa-Pasay area. The NAIAx extension also aims to cut travel time between Coastal Road and SM Mall of Asia areas and BGC to just 10 minutes. The NAIAx, a private-public partnership project that SMC opened last year, is a key part of Metro Manila’s tollroad network.

Grace Poe that the LTFRB would issue a memorandum circular on this new requirement in “moving forward to solve this issue” on regulating the Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS).  “We have to go back to the original concept of ride-sharing. We cannot allow that there are TNVS operators operating more than 20 or 30 units,” he told Poe who asked him whether the LTFRB would limit the number of vehicles to be owned by TNVS operators. Asked by Poe what would happen to operators with 10 or more units, Delgra replied: “We know we cannot simply drop them.”  He said he was aware that a large number of TNVS operators had gone to the extent of borrowing money from banks to “get a car so they would be able to put it in Uber or Grab.” According to Delgra, there will be a “transition period” for those who will be affected by the new requirement and they will be offered options.  “Considering the fact that they are actually maintaining a fleet already; they own 20 units under one name [so] they can go [into] taxi service.

Organizers in some cities were calling for a 24-hour stoppage while the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents both app and traditional taxi drivers, called on drivers to shut down all apps between 7:00 am (1100 GMT) and 9:00 am.  It was unclear how many drivers would take part in the work stoppage amid strike calls in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston and elsewhere. A similar action was expected in London, according to US organizers. The app drivers for Uber, Lyft, Via and other platforms are seeking improved job security, including an end to arbitrary “deactivations,” and a better revenue split between drivers and platforms.  In New York, the alliance was expecting most of its 10,000 app drivers to participate in the stoppage as well as some non-members. “Wall Street investors are telling Uber and Lyft to cut down on driver income, stop incentives, and go faster to driverless cars,” Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York association, said in a statement.   “Uber and Lyft wrote in their (regulatory) filings that they think they pay drivers too much already. With the IPO, Uber’s corporate owners are set to make billions, all while drivers are left in poverty and go bankrupt.” In Washington, the Drive United association of drivers called for a protest at Reagan National Airport to support the actions in other locations. “We are asking riders not to cross the picket lines and to respect the strike,” said Drive United organizer Jeffrey Dugas. Drive United said the action was in solidarity with protests in the US and other areas of the world where drivers struggle with the independent contractor model.  “We’ve spoken with hundreds of drivers, and they know that it’s wrong for Lyft and Uber executives to make millions while drivers can’t afford healthcare,” said Stan De La Cruz, a member of the Washington group. In Los Angeles, organizers called for “apps off” for 24 hours starting at midnight (0700 GMT) and a series of protests at Los Angeles International Airport. IPO in the wings Uber is set to launch its initial public offering (IPO) this week at an estimated valuation of some $90 billion, including its options and restricted stock unit. The launch will be a major milestone for the company, which has raised billions and disrupted the taxi industry in hundreds of cities around the world. The move follows a troubled market debut for Uber’s largest US rival Lyft, which has lost more than 15 percent of its value since its March IPO. The strikes highlight the dilemma for rideshare firms, which have faced challenges from regulators and traditional taxi operators for using a business model relying on independent contractors. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Uber’s rideshare “take rate” increased slightly to 21.7 percent in 2018 but that this will remain a hot point of contention for Uber. “We do see added risk from Uber aiming to take greater share of the fare from drivers and expect that the more Uber pushes here, the more drivers will fight back and protest, increasing the likelihood of regulations (particularly at the state level in the US and in Europe) of minimum wage guarantees,” Ives said in a research note. Uber said in a statement: “Drivers are at the heart of our service — we can’t succeed without them — and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road.” Lyft drivers’ hourly earnings have increased over the past two years and surpassed $10 billion, the company said in a statement.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Over 75 percent drive less than 10 hours a week to supplement their existing jobs,” Lyft said. “On average, Lyft drivers earn over $20 per hour.” Both Lyft and Uber set aside some of their shares for drivers as part of their offerings."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/914937/angara-asks-ltfrb-to-make-compromise-pact-with-grab-uber","title":"Angara asks LTFRB to make ‘compromise pact’ with Grab, Uber","date":"05:49 PM July 18, 2017","snippet":"Sen.

During the hearing of its petition calling for the suspension of Uber’s accreditation over its pricing system, 1-United Transport Koalisyon (1-UTAK) party-list group alleged that it is “unfair” for other public utility vehicles to wait for LTFRB approval to adjust its fares while Uber and other  transportation network companies (TNCs) can set and adjust their fares.  1-UTAK Chair Vigor Mendoza is assailing the legality of the department order issued last May which created TNCs as a new transport service category, saying that it granted such companies the power to set their fares. Mendoza said that their petition before the regulatory agency boils down to a single demand: to have an equal playing field for TNCs like Uber and public utility vehicles in terms of pricing.  He also cited the need of having “reasonable and affordable” pricing for TNCs, citing what happened on Sept. 8 when heavy rains pushed for the five-fold increase of the usual rate of Uber vehicles. “What drivers are seeking is equal treatment. If the law states that fare adjustments should undergo public hearing, it should be abided. You cannot provide a service which is unreasonably priced, even if it is efficient. What our law states is that fares should be reasonable and affordable,”  Mendoza said.  On their part, Atty. Grace Ann Lazaro, counsel for Uber, claimed that they are allowed to set their rates in accordance to the the department order which provided their accreditation as a TNC. “When Uber applied for accreditation, we believe that the overall board has examined the fare structure we submitted,” Lazaro said. However, LTFRB Chairman Atty. Winston Ginez said that the regulatory agency has oversight functions to peg the rates set by Uber and other TNCs. “We have the power to adjust the fare to what we think will serve the interest of the public,” Ginez said. The LTFRB is yet to decide on the petition as it gave 10 days for each party to send their respective position papers."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/268916/uber-wins-1b-investment-from-toyota-softbank-fund","title":"Uber wins $1B investment from Toyota, SoftBank fund","date":"12:52 PM April 19, 2019","snippet":"TOKYO — Japanese car giant Toyota and investment fund SoftBank Vision Fund on Friday unveiled an investment of $1 billion in US company Uber to drive forward the development of driverless ridesharing services.","body":"TOKYO — Japanese car giant Toyota and investment fund SoftBank Vision Fund on Friday unveiled an investment of $1 billion in US company Uber to drive forward the development of driverless ridesharing services. The latest cash injection, expected to close in the third quarter this year, came amid fevered anticipation of Uber’s public share offering which is expected to be the largest in the tech sector for years.   Toyota has already invested $500 million in Uber as the firm races Google-owned Waymo and a host of other companies, including major automakers, to develop self-driving vehicles.  The latest investment, which also involves Japanese parts maker DENSO, will go to Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group in a bid to “accelerate the development and commercialization of automated ridesharing,” the firms said in a statement. Toyota and DENSO are stumping up $667 million and SoftBank Vision Fund, the investment arm of Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, will pour $333 million into the venture. It is already the top shareholder in Uber, holding 16 percent.   The Japanese car firm said it would also contribute “an additional $300 million over the next three years to help cover the costs related to these activities.” Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said driverless cars would “transform transportation as we know it, making our streets safer and our cities more liveable.” His firm is aiming to go beyond car rides to becoming the “Amazon of transportation” in a future where people share, instead of own, vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train, then grab an e-bike, share a ride or take an e-scooter at the arriving station to complete a journey — all using an Uber app on a smartphone. Uber is also seeing growing success with an “Eats” service that lets drivers make money delivering meals ordered from restaurants. ‘Sharing economy’ Last week, Uber filed official documents for its much-anticipated public share offering. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said it operates on six continents with some 14 million trips per day and has totalled more than 10 billion rides since it was founded in 2010. The filing contained a “placeholder” amount of $1 billion to be raised but that figure is expected to increase ahead of the initial public offering (IPO) expected in May. The Wall Street Journal said earlier this month that Uber was seeking to raise $10 billion in what would be the largest stock offering of the year.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Media reports said the ride-hailing giant was likely to seek a market value of close to $100 billion. Uber is the largest of the “unicorns” or venture-backed firms worth at least $1 billion to list on Wall Street, and is one of the key companies in the “sharing economy” based on offering services to replace ownership of cars, homes and other commodities. Its revenue grew 42 percent last year to $11.2 billion but it continued to lose money from its operations. A net profit was reported for the year from a large asset sale, but operational losses were more than $3 billion. And some analysts have voiced caution over the forthcoming IPO given a relative lacklustre debut for Lyft, the main US rival. Khosrowshahi has promised greater transparency as he seeks to restore confidence in the global ridesharing leader hit by a wave of misconduct scandals. In October, Toyota and SoftBank announced the creation of a joint venture to create “new mobility service” including driverless vehicles for services such as meal deliveries. The new company — called “Monet”, short for “mobility network” — is majority owned by SoftBank. SoftBank started as a software firm but has increasingly been pushing into investments under tycoon Son, one of Japan’s richest men."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/212314/processing-uber-grab-applications-stopped","title":"Processing of Uber, Grab applications stopped","date":"01:00 AM July 23, 2016","snippet":"Uber and Grab went on the defensive Friday, saying their operations helped ease road congestion as the Department of Transportation ordered a review of existing regulations and placed on hold thousands of new applications in Metro Manila.","body":"Uber and Grab went on the defensive Friday, saying their operations helped ease road congestion as the Department of Transportation ordered a review of existing regulations and placed on hold thousands of new applications in Metro Manila. The government’s review of policies for the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), which covered this sector, was due to the “sheer volume of applicants” and ridesharing fare-setting schemes that remained unregulated, DOTr spokesperson Cherie Mercado said.  Both US-based Uber, which has a wide global footprint, and Malaysia’s Grab, the biggest ridesharing company in the region, insisted that they provided a crucial service and that      their presence did not worsen Metro Manila’s traffic-strangled roads. “TNVs do not add to the congestion on the roads in Manila. In fact, we offer the solution by providing vehicles the technology that utilize GPS data to work around traffic and road hazards,” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in a statement.  “At the moment, there is still more demand for our services than supply and the capping of applications will only take away an alternative for individuals who want to earn extra or those who want to improve their livelihoods,” Cu added. Uber Philippines issued a similar statement, citing its carpool service to lessen vehicles on the road.  “This decision also impedes our goal to get more people into fewer cars. Fewer drivers on Uber leads to lower reliability of service for riders in Metro Manila, who have come to rely on Uber as a viable alternative to buying and driving their own private vehicles,” Uber said. According to the DOTr, the review would affect about 29,000 pending applications as of July 15 this year. Of these, 23,000 applications alone are for Uber. Grab had 5,727 applications while UHOP had 131. The review was formalized via a memorandum from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) dated July 21, 2016. In line with this, it ordered the “suspension of the acceptance of all TNVS applications proposing to ply on the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1320390/court-tells-uber-lyft-to-classify-drivers-as-employees","title":"Court tells Uber, Lyft to classify drivers as employees","date":"08:24 AM August 12, 2020","snippet":"SAN FRANCISCO — A California court has given Uber and Lyft until the middle of next week to reclassify drivers as employees in compliance with a new state law.","body":"SAN FRANCISCO — A California court has given Uber and Lyft until the middle of next week to reclassify drivers as employees in compliance with a new state law. The order came Monday when a judge granted a restraining order in a lawsuit filed by California attorney general Xavier Becerra and three cities including San Francisco, where Lyft and Uber are based.  The suit calls on the companies to comply with a state law that went into effect at the start of this year that requires “gig workers” such as Uber and Lyft drivers to be classified as employees, eligible for unemployment, medical and other benefits. “The court has weighed in and agreed: Uber and Lyft need to put a stop to unlawful misclassification of their drivers while our litigation continues,” Becerra said in a release.  “While this fight still has a long way to go, we’re pushing ahead to make sure the people of California get the workplace protections they deserve.” Uber is backing a referendum in the state to overturn the law, while pledging to provide benefits for a social safety net that would keep gig workers independent.  The judge wrote in the ruling that Uber and Lyft could not indefinitely put off their “day of reckoning” when it came to complying with the law. Uber has argued that most of its drivers want to remain independent even if they also are looking for benefits. “Misclassification hurts drivers and it puts the burden on taxpayers to pay for benefits that Uber and Lyft should be providing,” said San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera. “During this global pandemic, it’s even more important for drivers to get access to protections like unemployment insurance.” The judge gave Uber and Lyft 10 days to comply with the order, which the companies can appeal.  Uber outlined proposals this week for a new type of relationship with gig workers, including its own drivers, that would keep them as independent contractors but with some guaranteed benefits. The ride-hailing giant described “a new model for independent platform work” in an 18-page document it hopes can be used as a blueprint for Uber and similar firms relying on independent workers. The company seeks “to deliver certainty for millions of independent contractors who will increasingly rely on independent work to help them face the economic challenges that lie ahead,” Uber said in its document. Uber proposed that gig economy companies be required to establish “benefits funds,” allowing gig workers to accrue and use the money for benefits or paid leave. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, writing in The New York Times, said that the current employment system is outdated and “forces every worker to choose between being an employee with more benefits but less flexibility, or an independent contractor with more flexibility but almost no safety net.” Uber argues that requiring drivers to be classified as employees would leave jobs only for a small fraction of its drivers and that costs would become more expensive."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/241972/npc-set-issue-compliance-order-demand-condition-uber-ph-npc-uber-hacking-liboro-breach-business-transportation","title":"NPC set to issue compliance order to demand condition from Uber PH","date":"04:41 PM December 05, 2017","snippet":"The National Privacy Commission (NPC) said it would eventually issue a compliance order to demand certain conditions from Uber Philippines as further details about the hack continue to unravel.","body":"The National Privacy Commission (NPC) said it would eventually issue a compliance order to demand certain conditions from Uber Philippines as further details about the hack continue to unravel. However, Privacy Commissioner Raymund Liboro said they are yet to draft the order since they are still in the process of gathering information regarding the incident. Up to now, Liboro said that Uber still couldn’t pin down the level of impact the breach had on Filipino Uber users.  This follows the admission made by the company’s US office last month, noting that millions of personal information worldwide have been compromised by a hack that Uber deliberately hid for more than a year. Later, Uber Philippines said that Filipino data are included in the breach.READ: Uber admits data from 57M riders, drivers stolen by hackers In a press briefing on Tuesday, Liboro categorically said that they would file a compliance order regardless of the outcome of the investigation. He said it could include a requirement to put up help centers for Filipinos who may want to ask further information regarding the hack.  Moreover, this could even include an identity theft insurance, which is the practice of more advanced privacy authorities. “Other jurisdictions have other ways of remediating it. For example, in some advanced countries, the authorities would regard them to identity theft insurance. It really depends on the nature of the data itself. If warranted, we could go to that extent. But at this point, we haven’t gotten the whole picture yet,” he said.  The investigation develops as the NPC recently partnered with 10 other countries in the Asia and Pacific in order to help in information sharing for cross-border cases. Last week, NPC said the administrators confirmed its status as a Privacy Enforcement Authority (PEA) under the APEC Cross Border Privacy Enforcement Arrangement (CPEA). Liboro said this is “bad news for Uber” since this would make it easier to work with other privacy authorities whose countries were also affected by the hack.  Other members of the network include Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, US, and Mexico. “We are using the network to reach out to our partners in the CPEA in this information gathering stage,” he said. The network was developed for cross border privacy rules (CBPR). Apart from aiding in the investigation, Liboro said this would also enable Philippine-based companies to get their data-privacy and protection systems certified with a local Accountability Agent.  For businesses, he said this would mean less hassle as certification would amount to meeting the privacy requirements of each member-country in the system. /jpv RELATED STORY NPC set to step in if Uber hack compromised PH users"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/246421/uber-launch-ridesharing-service-pampanga-1st-half-2018","title":"Uber to launch ridesharing service in Pampanga in 1st half of 2018","date":"05:35 AM February 24, 2018","snippet":"Uber Philippines is starting its ridesharing service in Pampanga province within the first semester of 2018 as the transport regulator is set to lift a moratorium on the processing of new drivers.","body":"Uber Philippines is starting its ridesharing service in Pampanga province within the first semester of 2018 as the transport regulator is set to lift a moratorium on the processing of new drivers. The announcement was made by Cat Avelino, Uber Philippines head of communications, on Friday as the company celebrated its fourth year of operations in the country.  The company, the local unit of San Francisco, United States-based Uber Technologies, currently operates in Metro Manila and Cebu, where it competes with main rival Grab. Yves Gonzalez, Uber Philippines head of government relations and public policy, said there was growing demand in Pampanga, especially around the Clark Freeport Zone.  The Duterte administration has emphasized the development of Clark, which it sees as a solution to Metro Manila’s congestion woes. The Department of Transportation is currently expanding the Clark International Airport. It is also targeting to build a railway line linking Clark to Manila by 2022. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) earlier announced that the processing of driver applications would start on March 5. The moratorium was ordered since the LTFRB wanted a closer look at the ridesharing industry. It had been in place since July 2016.  Under LTFRB Memorandum Circular No. 2018-005, the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) was capped at 65,000 for Metro Manila. Metro Cebu would get 1,500 cars while Pampanga was allowed 250 cars. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada, who was present during the anniversary celebration, said the 65,000 cap in Metro Manila was enough to serve about 75 percent of the demand. She said there were currently around 59,000 ridesharing vehicles in the capital district serving around 52 percent of available demand. The cap would be reviewed every three months, Lizada noted. “We want to see the churn rate, we want to see the blacklisting of drivers,” Lizada said when asked about factors the LTFRB would review. For riders booking either Grab or Uber, the optimal waiting time should be two to three minutes instead of the current 10 to 15 minutes, she said. This will also be considered in the LTFRB’s regular review, she said.

The San Francisco-based company expects to be valued at $80.5 billion to $91.5 billion, falling well below prior estimates that rose as high as $120 billion, in a sign that investors may be taking a more cautious approach to ride-hailing after the stock performance of Uber’s rival, Lyft.  Even so, Uber is on track for one of the largest IPOs in history. The company plans to sell 180 million shares for between $44 and $50 each. Lyft went public last month and its stock price fell 21% from its initial offering price of $72, and was selling for about $57 on Friday.  “With Lyft’s IPO being down more than 20% in a market that’s hitting new highs every day, that’s a dynamic that probably has been factored in as well,” said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. Uber is part of a wave of technology companies that are going public, and Pinterest and Zoom both saw their stock prices climb substantially after their IPOs this month. Slack and Postmates are also waiting for their turn.  Over the coming weeks Uber is likely to revise those figures as it launches its so-called road show, where it pitches the company and gets feedback from potential investors. It is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange next month. Uber also disclosed that PayPal plans to buy $500 million in stock at the IPO price, and that the companies will explore future commercial payment collaborations, including the development of Uber’s digital wallet. Uber gave potential investors a first look at its finances this month, revealing nearly $8 billion in losses over a decade. That mirrors the challenges faced by Lyft. But Uber also showed impressive growth. Its revenue totaled $11.3 billion in 2018, which was a 42% increase from $7.9 billion in 2017, and far above its $495 million in revenue in 2014. That rapid growth has continued this year. On a preliminary basis, revenue rose to a range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion during the three months that ended March 31, compared with $2.6 billion a year ago.  However, the company estimated losses of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the first quarter. Uber chalks them up to operational expenses as the company continues to invest in its core platform, including spending on incentives and promotions. In the first quarter of 2018, Uber posted a one-time profit of $3.7 billion, helped by the sale of its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia, which brought in $3.2 billion, and an unrealized $2 billion gain from Uber’s investment in Didi, the transportation network company in China. Both Uber and Lyft face an uncertain path to profitability as they deal with intense competition, high costs to pay drivers, increased regulation by cites and a long, uncertain road to the development of autonomous vehicles.“We know that companies with large losses tend to be problematic for IPO investors,” said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research and IPO exchange traded funds. “There is no doubt that Lyft is a factor in Uber’s valuation.” While Lyft is primarily a domestic ride-sharing business, Uber is building a ride-sharing platform that it can also use to monetize its freight and food delivery businesses, Ives said. “Lyft doesn’t have that,” Ives said. “It’s more of a one-trick pony right now.” Uber also lost market share after a series of embarrassing revelations and has been working to repair its reputation. It disclosed earlier this month that it faces a criminal investigation from the U.S. Justice Department into a cover-up of a massive computer break-in during 2016 that took personal information of millions of passengers and drivers, among other legal challenges. Uber stockholders also will be selling 27 million shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase stock."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248824/uber-ordered-continue-services-beyond-april-8","title":"Uber ordered to continue services beyond April 8","date":"02:13 PM April 07, 2018","snippet":"The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has ordered Uber to continue its services beyond April 8, delaying Grab’s takeover deal for weeks, or even months.","body":"The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has ordered Uber to continue its services beyond April 8, delaying Grab’s takeover deal for weeks, or even months. In a statement, PCC said it ordered both ride-hailing firms to keep separate and independent operations until the antitrust body wraps up its review of the acquisition.  PCC had issued a set of interim measures to preserve the same business conditions prior to the deal. This means riders and drivers should still be able to choose Uber as an alternative to Grab for the time being. The order echoes a similar move made by PCC’s counterpart in Singapore, which ordered Uber to continue operating the app for another week, or until April 15, due to similar anti-competitive concerns.  Feasibility Uber’s compliance to the order in Singapore “indicates the feasibility of continuing its operations in the Philippines as well,” PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said.  This comes despite claims made by Uber officials that the company has officially left the market, leaving no one behind to man the app. The antitrust body, however, did not buy this explanation. Since Uber acquired a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s regional business as part of the takeover deal, it is not true that Uber has indeed left the country, Balisacan said. “The PCC believes that Uber is capable of operating its ride-hailing app in the country, despite its claims that it has already exited the Southeast Asia market,” he said. Integration “Uber is highlighting its exit, but what it does not emphasize enough is its integration with Grab. Thus, Uber is not truly exiting the Philippine market, but rather effectively merging their operations with Grab here. The deal makes Uber a part-owner of Grab,” he added.  Last month, Grab announced it would acquire Uber in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. The deal has also put other competition authorities in the region on their toes. In the Philippines, PCC previously said the acquisition would result to Grab controlling around 80 percent of the ride hailing market in the country. This is a concern especially since Grab has been known for its relatively higher rider fees and how it discriminates against rider destinations. PCC officials raised these concerns during a public hearing with Grab and Uber representatives on April 5. Penalties Should Grab and Uber fail to comply in five working days, they would have to “show cause” within 24 hours after the end of the five-day period, according to an excerpt of the interim measures. The parties should then explain “why they should not be held in contempt and subjected to penalties.” PCC did not list the possible penalties. However, according to the Philippine Competition Act, erring parties would have to pay P50,000 to P2 million for each violation. Moreover, they would have to eventually pay a similar amount for each day they did the violations until the parties fully comply with the order.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The duration of the review depends on the cooperation of the companies, Balisacan said in a previous interview. Under current rules, the review could end in a matter of weeks, or even extend up to six months. Not business as usual Representatives from Uber and Grab are yet to comment on the matter. However, during the public hearing on April 5, officials and lawyers from both companies wanted business to go as planned, noting that some of PCC’s concerns were unwarranted. Uber’s next move is yet to be seen. But according to Brooks Entwistle, Uber chief business officer for Asia Pacific, the company, which has been losing money in Southeast Asia, does not intend to return to the market. Falling apart “Our people are gone. Our funding is gone. Our marketplace is falling apart by every day as we transition [to Grab],” he said during the public hearing. In the same hearing, Grab external legal counsel Arlene Maneja said the acquisition involves driver contracts as well as other data that drivers consented to give. The deal does not include the integration of both Grab and Uber systems, she said, therefore concerns such as Grab’s access to Uber’s pricing mechanisms were unnecessary. “We think, that if it means the commission is going to compel to reverse that business decision, we think that is a burdensome and disproportionate response to what is a valid management protocol,” she said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248997/ltfrb-orders-uber-resolve-issues-april-15","title":"LTFRB orders Uber to resolve its issues by April 15","date":"05:07 PM April 11, 2018","snippet":"Two government regulatory bodies are now at loggerheads with each other as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Uber to resolve its issues with the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) by Sunday, April 15, after which it would cease to be recognized as a transport network company (TNC).","body":"Two government regulatory bodies are now at loggerheads with each other as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Uber to resolve its issues with the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) by Sunday, April 15, after which it would cease to be recognized as a transport network company (TNC). “In the interest of all TNVS [transport network vehicle services] and the riding public, we are giving you until April 15 to exist as a TNC. On April 16, you will cease and desist to exist as a TNC,” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said during Wednesday’s special board meeting.  The LTFRB order comes just four days after the PCC told Uber and Grab to continue to operate independently in the country while it conducts its motu propio review on the deal, which resulted in Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia and gave it a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s operations in the region. During the hearing, Uber Philippines’ counsel Joseph Omar Castillo told the board that while they intended to withdraw their petitions for a fare hike and reaccreditation as a TNC, they were constrained to do so because of the PCC order.  Earlier, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said that, under their transaction service agreement with Uber, they decided to extend their funding of the operations of the Uber app to April 15 just to comply with the PCC directive. According to him, however, doing so would not only defeat the purpose of what PCC wanted, but would also put the riding public in danger since Uber would no longer have any back-end support in the country that would address complaints and take care of passengers in the event of an accident.  In issuing the order, Lizada said that, the LTFRB understood Uber’s predicament, prolonging its operations would adversely affect the riding public and the thousands of app-based drivers. The PCC review is expected to last for around six months. “The soonest possible time that you [Uber] will be able to resolve your concerns with PCC, the better,” she said. Meanwhile, LTFRB also ordered Grab to “immediately” lower its surge pricing cap from twice the rate to just 1.5, as it processes the accreditation of new TNCs that would take the place of Uber. “This is to ensure that the fare will be at a rate that is conducive and acceptable to the existing number of TNVS that are transferring to Grab,” Lizada said.  In recent days, passengers have complained of Grab’s high fares following Uber’s exit in the country. But Cu said they were not taking advantage of the situation as he pointed out that the price surge was due to the lack of drivers in their system. He explained that, while there had been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in their system only rose by around 30 percent. Cu noted that the reason Uber’s fare was lower than theirs was because Uber’s approved per kilometer rate was at P5, while theirs was at P11. He added that, if Uber would not exit the country, its rate would soon be similar to theirs as it sought the LTFRB an increase to P12 per kilometer. /atm"},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/105988/regulate-uber-grab-now","title":"Regulate Uber and Grab now","date":"05:00 AM August 01, 2017","snippet":"There is no denying that Uber and Grab are quite successful in our country, or at least in Metro Manila.

They provide a very much appreciated service for people on the go, who get picked up at the front door and dropped off at the destination much like a taxi service, in the comfort of a clean and newer vehicle. The passengers do not even have to carry cash, and the drivers for the most part are well-spoken and officially identified by the network. The ride experience itself is also rated.  In short, Uber and Grab are the next step in the evolution of what taxis ought to be, and the taxi industry should seriously start adapting the new practices. There is no denying, however, that some smarty pants are really trying to go around the system taking advantage of the platform to virtually start their underground cab business, and some individuals are lured by the false pretense that it is okay to do it full time like a legitimate regular job.  This fad or notion of the “share” or “gig” economy took off in other countries, and we decided to copy it. A lot of people invested in new vehicles with the notion that the vehicles will eventually pay for themselves and at the same time give them a handsome income depending on how long they drive per day or week. I think the fault really lies in a combination of factors. First, there were no clear-cut guidelines set forth by the governing agency. And secondly, there is a lack of a nondisclaimer on the part of Uber and Grab toward their “employees.” Uber and Grab have failed to properly explain the concept of a “ride-share” and most likely willfully distorted the goal and aim of the app-service from a “sharing” economy to a full-time “gig” economy.  To fix this, there should be an imposed rest period or break period after a drop, at least a three-hour period, to show at least that the service is not used like a regular cab. If they are operating like a nonstop service from all points  crisscrossing the metro, then obviously there is a violation and they are clearly guilty of operating like a gypsy or “colorum” cab. It may be high time that the LTFRB started selling franchises to existing Uber and Grab operations, especially those which operate like a cab. In the meantime, regular taxis should start developing apps for their services to be able to directly compete with Uber and Grab; this will be specially helpful for cabs that are going in a certain direction and cannot refuse a passenger going in the opposite direction. Plus they don’t have to waste gas roaming around trying to chance upon passengers on the street, not to mention having drivers in databases that are identifiable and having the convenience of cashless transactions. There is obviously a market with wide public support, but unfortunately it is operating in a gray area.  It’s high time the LTFRB started upping its game and sort this issue. If Uber or Grab are operating like a cab service, then all the necessary fines and penalties should be imposed.

Media reports said the ride-hailing giant is seeking to raise some $10 billion in what would be the largest stock offering of the year.  That could result in a valuation close to $100 billion — an impressive figure but below some earlier estimates amid an ebbing of enthusiasm on growth and profitability, the Wall Street Journal reported.   The Journal said details of Uber’s initial public offering (IPO) would be released Thursday and the market debut was expected in May. The IPO comes after a lackluster response to last month’s market debut for Lyft, the main US rival of Uber. Lyft shares rose on the first day of trade and then lost ground. On Wednesday, shares were down more than 10 percent from the $72 offering price. The Journal, citing unnamed sources, said Uber recently provided documents showing a potential price range of between $48 and $55 a share, implying a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion. These figures could change ahead of the market launch but would be below the estimated $120 billion suggested by some investment bankers, according to the report.  “Even a valuation in the $90 billion to $100 billion range would represent a healthy premium to the latest private valuation (some $76 billion) in August 2018,” said Matt Kennedy of the IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. “Uber will definitely be pegged to Lyft. So they can’t be too aggressive on valuation, given where Lyft is trading. Though it’s possible that some of the pressure on Lyft is related to investors looking to pick up Uber instead.” Analysts warn both Uber and Lyft will need strong growth to justify their lofty valuations, and face multiple challenges to their business model which has disrupted traditional taxi services and relies on drivers to be independent contractors. The ride-hailing firms are also investing in other “last mile” transport options such as electric bikes and scooters, and in the long run are looking to autonomous vehicles as a way to reduce dependence on private cars and reshape urban landscapes. Unicorn stampede Uber is the latest, and will be largest of the so-called “unicorns,” or venture-backed startups worth at least $1 billion, to look to Wall Street listings to expand their capital base. But some of the early enthusiasm about this unicorn herd has waned and there are hints that private investment rounds may have been priced too high. Pinterest, a virtual bulletin board that connects people with interests including food, fashion, travel and lifestyle, plans to trade under the symbol PINS on the New York Stock Exchange. Pinterest unveiled its IPO price range with an estimated valuation of some $11 billion, below the $12 billion in its most recent private funding round. Other big tech firms which could join the stampede include the business collaboration startup Slack and big data firm Palantir.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Aswath Damodaran, a New York University business professor specializing in corporate valuations, calculated Lyft to be worth around $16 billion, below its the more than $20 billion at its IPO price. Uber released financial data earlier this year showing it lost $865 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $1.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. The San Francisco-based firm reported revenue of $3 billion, a 25 percent increase from a year earlier.

But how on earth would LTFRB determine whether or not Uber would have recovered even just a peso of the fine from passengers? And what penalty would LTFRB impose on Uber this time?  LTFRB still had no written official rules—up to this time—on the new transport service so-called TNVS, or transport network vehicle service, neither taxi nor casual car-pooling, that became a big hit all over the world in the past five years already. Thus, LTFRB would again have to invent the penalties on the fly, precisely because it had no rules on anything regarding the business of Uber. Actually LTFRB grappled with the same problem— meaning, no established rules—when it recently suspended Uber for one month. LTFRB only lifted the suspension because the public clamored for the return of Uber.  By the way, LTFRB officials flew to Davao City last Friday, on the day they decided to lift the suspension, apparently after some dressing down from the motor-biking Duterte Harley. But why in the first place did LTFRB suspend Uber? Because Uber violated the rule of LTFRB that Uber could not accept new application from any driver. Since when, in any business known to man, did the mere acceptance of an application become a “violation?” Every company regularly gets applications from suppliers and job seekers and keeps them on file for future reference. It is as much a routine in business as the paycheck.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, was what the LTFRB outlawed, which was punishable with one-month suspension but changeable to the P190-million fine. Actually, more than 2 years ago in 2015 under the Aquino (Part II) administration, LTFRB actually allowed Uber and other TNVS companies to operate in the entire country. Since then Uber accredited almost 67,000 units, an amazing feat by itself, because the new service became a hit to the riding public for its app-driven convenience. All of a sudden in 2016 under Duterte Harley, LTFRB declared those thousands of vehicles as “colorum” and threatened to impound them. But how could the drivers apply for franchises, much less get them, when LTRFB precisely did not have the rules on TNVS? Basta, they were colorum! When Congress stepped into the mess, LTFRB agreed on a compromise that Uber should not accept and activate new units.There—LTFRB agreed to let what it declared to be “colorum” vehicles to operate.  For that matter, even with the P190 million fine on Uber, LTFRB also allowed the “colorum” Uber to operate, as long as it shelled out tons of money. Would LTFRB then treat hundreds of other “colorum” vehicles similarly? By the way, more than 4 years ago in 2013, California already came up with rules on companies like Uber, and other countries used the California rules as model. Again, those rules came about more than four years ago, from which LTFRB could have borrowed some ideas. More than a year under Duterte Harley, LTFRB still had no rules, and thus it had to invent them along the way, together with the penalties. Really, LTFRB had no explanation for the rather long one-month suspension of Uber as the penalty for violation of something that did not exist. Why one month? Why not one year? Why not just kill Uber? To top it all, LTRFB also ordered Uber to pay its thousands of drivers for their “lost income” as a result of the suspension—for the entire one month. And the stupid Uber complied, inspiring LTFRB to go further by advising Uber drivers to shift to Grab or Uhop, while being paid by Uber without working. What did the law on graft and corruption say again about public officials charged with the grant of licenses or permits who give unwarranted advantage to anybody—something about it being a crime? Really, even under Duterte Harley, the ways of LTFRB could never be the way to govern in this country."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249822/uber-points-ltfrb-order-failure-meet-pcc-condition","title":"Uber points to LTFRB order for its failure to meet PCC condition","date":"05:14 AM April 26, 2018","snippet":"Uber Philippines has blamed its failure to comply with one of the conditions of an ongoing review by the Philippine Competition Commission to a stop order issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).","body":"Uber Philippines has blamed its failure to comply with one of the conditions of an ongoing review by the Philippine Competition Commission to a stop order issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The review was triggered by the announcement by Grab of its regional takeover of Uber’s business here in Southeast Asia, a move which raised serious consumer concerns in the Philippines.  PCC reviewed the deal between the two firms, asking the stakeholders to delay the acquisition in the meantime. The interim measures were set to keep the findings of an ongoing PCC review accurate. One of the conditions was for Grab and Uber to continue working independently and separately until the the review is finished.  Scheduled to end its services on April 8, Uber agreed to extend the availability of its app to April 15 given the ongoing PCC review. In the Philippines, Grab said it shouldered the costs of Uber’s one week extension. However, following the release of PCC’s interim measures, the LTFRB slapped Uber with a cease and desist order, requiring the firm to stop its operations on April 15.  Commissioner Stella Alabastro Quimbo said on Wednesday that Uber and Grab Philippines recently submitted reports that explained both their compliance and non-compliance with the antitrust body’s conditions. “We’re still studying the documents that they provided. Of course, in the topic of penalties, you have to afford the parties due process. We’re still studying what the next steps may be, which could include a hearing,” she said in a phone interview. It would seem that Uber is in a tough spot, wherein following one regulator might come at the expense of disobeying the other. However, according to lawyer Anthony Abad, one of the proponents of the Philippine Competition Act since its early days in 1993, this does not necessarily have to end in a deadlock. “If they [Uber] want to, they certainly can. They can appeal but whether LTFRB would agree to the appeal is another question,” Abad previously said.  When asked if such an appeal would be considered, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada deferred from giving a categorical answer. Instead, she said in a text message that this would require a “collegial decision.” But apart from LTFRB’s consideration, the prospects of an extension of Uber’s operations still seem dim. Miguel Aguila, legal counsel for Grab Philippines, said the company would no longer shoulder the cost of another extension of the Uber app."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/200831/the-asian-uber-rich","title":"The Asian Uber-Rich","date":"12:30 AM October 16, 2015","snippet":"NEW York-based Singaporean writer Kevin Kwan has written two bestselling fiction books, “Crazy Rich Asians” and “China Rich Girlfriend,” based on the uber-wealthy in Asia.","body":"NEW York-based Singaporean writer Kevin Kwan has written two bestselling fiction books, “Crazy Rich Asians” and “China Rich Girlfriend,” based on the uber-wealthy in Asia. Asians are typically depicted as war survivors or weakling nerds, so it is refreshing that Kwan (whose family belongs to the Old Rich) has now slyly yanked the covers off the world of elite families in China, Hong Kong and Singapore.  In Kwan’s books, males remain on top of the hierarchy. Mothers spoil their only sons and sacrifice everything for them.  Take the characters Bao Gaoliang and his wife Shaoyen, who worked hard to grow their medical supplies business inherited from earlier generations.  Gaoliang is now a party politician in China—and a billionaire.  Women power But Shaoyen flies economy while her only son Carlton relaxes in first class.  “Carlton can eat all the fancy Western food and, being a student under so much pressure, he needs all the rest he can get.  But for me, it’s not worth it.  I don’t touch airplane food, and I can never sleep on these long flights anyway,” she says. Carlton is charming but spoiled, with a taste for luxury.  His father threatens to disinherit him, “not completely … but giving him absolute control of everything would be a big mistake.” In the Philippines, women are at the helm of many family businesses (Tessie Sy-Coson of SM and Joji Gotianun-Yap of Filinvest come to mind).  But though times are changing, in some families, females, even wealthy daughters, count for little. The character of Jacqueline Ling says, “I’m a girl.  My grandfather was old-fashioned … and for people like him, girls weren’t supposed to inherit—they were just married off.  He put all his holdings in a labyrinthine family trust, stipulating that only males born with the Ling surname could benefit.” “It wasn’t really that loss of money that was affecting me the most,” Ling says.  “It was the loss of the privilege.  To suddenly realize that you are inconsequential even within your own family.”  How about in cases where all the children are female? Colette Bing, in love with Carlton Bao, has parents whose fortune eclipses that of his.  But Colette resists the injunction to marry a suitably matched counterpart and produce the next-generation heirs in turn. “Why did you send me to the most progressive schools in England if all you expected out of me was to get married at such a young age?  Why did I bother studying so hard at Regent’s?  I have so many goals, so many things I want to accomplish before I become anyone’s wife,” she says. Colette says she does not need a man to look after her.  “I am not going to get married and pump out babies just because you want a barrel full of grandsons.”  Her father then freezes her bank accounts. Social strata Social class is a weapon of the Old Rich, who scoff at the nouveau riche as Henrys (High Earners, Not Rich Yet). When patriarch A wakes up from a coma, he stops the clan’s spending.  A’s daughter-in-law B hates the spending restrictions, so she has an affair with scion C, whose wife D comes from another prominent family.  D’s grandmother E “retaliated by making sure every old-guard family in Southeast Asia shut their doors firmly” on the clans of A and C, so finally C “chose to crawl back to his wife [D] rather than run off with [B].” Even Chinese New Year is not spared.  Families visit each other in strict order, based on seniority, paying respects to the oldest (hint, richest) relatives first, the paternal side on the first day, the maternal side on the next. This often requires “complicated Excel flow charts, ang pow [red money envelopes] tracking apps, and plenty of Russian vodka to dull the migraine-inducing confusion of it all.” Filipino time appears to be also Hong Kong and Shanghai time, albeit done deliberately.  People arrive late to functions. “It’s a matter of face—no one wants to be the first to show up, in case they look too eager, so they try to outdo one another in lateness.  The last one to arrive is deemed the most important.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The right family connections are essential. Not having attended the proper school with the right crowd “eliminates you from participating in 70 percent of the conversations that occur during dinner parties at the best houses.” Such chitchat goes all the way back to childhood, since people are “all still completely obsessed with what happened when they were five.  Who was fat or thin?  Who wet her pants during choir practice?  Who’s [sic] father shut down Ocean Park for the day so that he could have a huge birthday party?” Are there crazy rich Filipinos in the books?  Evangeline de Ayala, a not-so-subtle allusion, appears briefly as a kind woman who says “swithart.”  Unfortunately, most Filipinas in Kwan’s books are still maids, and the lone Filipino a bartender, though a genius bartender in a swanky private jet at that.

The move is part of a series of studies into current policies since the Duterte administration came to power at the start of July this year. The department was also studying existing public utility franchises, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said earlier this week.  DOTr spokesman Cherie Mercado said the ridesharing review was needed because of the “sheer volume of applicants.” She said the government also wanted to look into the fare scheme used by ride sharing app operators. Currently, the companies are allowed to dictate their rates, which they said were driven by supply and demand factors.  According to the DOTr, the review would affect about 29,000 pending applications as of July 15, 2016. Of those, 23,000 applications alone are for Uber, the popular San Francisco, United States-based car hailing app. Grab had 5,727 applications while UHOP had 131. The review order was formalized via a memo from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, dated July 21, 2016. LTFRB said it would start reviewing policies on the issuance of franchises to Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) applications, which cover ridesharing apps.  READ: LTFRB member calls for limit to vehicles operating under Uber, Grab In line with this, it ordered the “suspension of the acceptance of all TNVS applications proposing to ply on the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.” “The technical division is directed not to accept any TNVS application upon effectivity of this circular. All regional offices are likewise not to accept TNVS applications with proposed route to operate entering Metro Manila,” the LTFRB memo added. The DOTr was unable to immediately share figures on the existing volume of Uber, Grab and UHOP vehicles on the road. However, Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, which had opposed the ridesharing sector given the added competition to the traditional taxi business and unregulated fares, estimated there were about 20,000 of these vehicles on the road today.  That compared with about 37,000 taxis nationwide, which Suntay said took about 60 years to reach against just two years for Uber and Grab. READ: Legal questions ain’t over for Uber “It’s the right decision to stop the issuances and review,” Suntay said in an interview. “We can coexist together with this industry, but what we’re after is a level playing field.” The development also comes as the DOTr, along with other government agencies, move to combat the “crisis” in Metro Manila.

The VCA on Wednesday said it had completed an investigation into the acquisition and transferred its conclusions to the Vietnam Competition Council for consideration.  The investigation found that Grab did not notify its purchase of Uber to market regulators and the deal could make Vietnamese taxi companies vulnerable due to a smaller market shares and changes in customer habits. The two violations are stated in sections 5 and 6 of Chapter 5 of the Competition Law.  The VCA added that within 30 days from receiving the documents, the council could make one of two decisions: returning the file for additional investigation (within 60 days) or suspending the case and open a hearing to issue a decision on the handling of the case. Grab announced on March 26 it had purchased Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam.  Following the merger, Uber now holds a 27.5 percent stake in Grab, while Uber’s CEO has joined Grab’s management board. The VCA has sent a dispatch to Grab requesting information and documents related to the acquisition. However, Grab claimed that since the combined market share of both Grab and Uber in Vietnam was less than 30 percent, it did not have to inform the competition authority before proceeding and completing this transaction in Vietnam. The VCA held a working session with Grab’s legal representative on April 6, but the firm failed to provide evidence proving its claim. Grab is one of the most frequently used O2O (online-to-offline) mobile platforms across 195 cities in Southeast Asia. More than five million people use the combined platform daily. If the concentrated share of parties accounted for 30 to 50 percent of the market without informing the VCA before an acquisition, firms would be fined 10 per cent of their total revenue from the previous financial year. If the rate was more than 50 per cent, the transaction would be prohibited, the VCA added."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/80081/uber-clash-of-law-vs-common-sense","title":"Uber: clash of law vs common sense","date":"02:45 AM November 13, 2014","snippet":"The commuting public hid none of its contempt for the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board’s crackdown on Uber, its trusted (albeit unlicensed) alternative to Manila taxis.

The LTFRB was legally correct, but only demonstrated how going strictly by black-letter law can be the worst possible myopia. Uber is a startup tech company from San Francisco with a simple idea: Use smartphones to connect passengers and drivers willing to hire out. It has a preset fee system with “surge” pricing that increases fees during peak hours. In practice, many cars and drivers are full-time Uber partners, including, in other countries, Uber-owned cars. With cashless, credit-card-based payments, GPS tracking, automatic recording of drivers, passengers and destinations, and a system where passengers rate drivers, Uber is reputed for disciplined, reliable, courteous drivers and comfortable cars—despite being self-regulated.  In contrast, we all hate Manila taxis. Passengers, even from commercial centers with heavy traffic, perpetually fear being held up by drivers or coconspirators who suddenly board the cab, or being molested after the air-conditioning is laced with a sleep-inducing chemical. One recent viral CCTV video caught a driver chasing a female passenger who had jumped out of the cab. Beyond security, one must deal with broken upholstery that reeks of stale sweat, tampered meters and drivers’ impunity in rejecting passengers with long trips. And as motorists know, the laws of nature dictate that taxi drivers not follow lane markings, swerve in front of turning cars or into their blind spots, move slowly in the fast lane, and stop abruptly in the middle of the street oblivious to cars behind them. A friend’s happiest Facebook update featured a photo of a taxi that collided with a jeepney, with this caption: “Karma.”  Even taxi drivers must hate themselves given the boundary system and the sleep deprivation that comes with 24-hour shifts. Pass by the corner of Valero and Dela Costa Streets in Makati at 3 a.m. to see the parked taxis with catnapping drivers. And taxi drivers get held up, too. Uber solves many of those problems, but its drivers hold no public franchises. Philippine law imposes grave responsibilities on those who regularly accept paying passengers from the public, beyond someone who casually offers a friend a ride. Certainly, public transport must be regulated to ensure safety and reliability. This must extend to regular Uber drivers and their credit-card- and smartphone-holding clientele, as it does to taxi, bus and jeepney operators. The disconnect, though, is that no mishap with self-regulated Uber has been reported, while our heavily regulated buses fall off flyovers. SoWhatsNews satirized that Uber should hire reckless, chloroform-wielding drivers to pass LTFRB standards.  Outside highfalutin’ philosophical debates on human rights, when law deals with commerce, it must don a practical, consumer-friendly hat. Judges know that when they assign liability, the classic case being who must pay after an accident, they nudge economic behavior and must ensure a net benefit to society. Regulation realizes a net benefit when its benefits exceed its costs. From this loftier legal vantage point, the problem is clear. If self-regulated Uber produces far better service, the LTFRB necessarily produces a negative social benefit. When we discard our bar-exam- and memory-oriented legal education and stop being enamored of enforcing law for its own sake, common sense tells us that we could abolish the LTFRB tomorrow and society would be better off. Common sense cries out that it is the LTFRB that must harness Uber’s innovations for more commuters’ benefit, and not Uber that must conform to the antiquated regulatory regime the LTFRB enforces—a mindset for which Metro Manila Development Authority Chair Francis Tolentino immediately voiced support. Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya soberly called for a dialogue, after which Uber agreed to have its drivers obtain LTFRB franchises and present legal reforms it advocates in other countries to the LTFRB. However, it is not enough to push taxi companies to adopt relatively superficial reforms such as centralized booking and tracking of lost and found items. If Uber has proven beyond all doubt that self-regulation is far more effective, LTFRB regulation must inevitably be streamlined to give way to market forces. A congressional inquiry is beginning and we hope one of our visionary, tech-savvy young legislators will overhaul black-letter law to conform to common sense, and breathe life into the sentence in our Constitution that reads: “The State recognizes the indispensable role of the private sector, encourages private enterprise, and provides incentives to needed investments.” Finally, Uber is a simple, technology-driven solution from a foreign company, and one would think hellish Manila traffic would have stimulated more homegrown solutions, such as local carpool app Tripid (and carpools have a stronger case for not needing franchises). Indeed, an increasing number of foreign entrepreneurs appear to be flocking to Manila’s nascent tech startup sector. One wonders if the LTFRB’s misstep is but a symptom of a much larger problem of our schools lagging in the production of entrepreneurs and out-of-the-box engineers that could envision an Uber, and our failure to produce a no-nonsense, business-friendly environment that could sustain it.

I belong to those thousands of workers who travel to and from work via our public transport system. Every work day is an agony especially when one has to go through commuting, which I term “buwis buhay” and always a survival of the fittest to and from work.  It’s a relief that there are Uber and Grab cars, a better alternative, if not the best, to go when I have to pamper myself from a hellish ride via the regular public transport. My teenage daughters introduced me to this modern day convenient ride experience. And if I were to rate all the rides I had with these transport network companies, I would readily give the rating of 10 on a scale of 1-10, with 10 as the highest. Compared to regular taxi cabs? Never mind is the easy answer. Both are on the extremes—best and worst.  You cannot blame me and the rest of the riding public who are fed up with many arrogant and ill-mannered drivers who pick commuters on the road at their convenience and personal gains. Many times I have been turned down when my destination is not the preferred way of many good-for-nothing drivers. But with Uber and Grab, all passengers are happily picked up, whenever and wherever. In my recent taxi ride from Terminal 4 last July 28, the assistance desk of the Department of Transportation did not deter the cab driver from taking advantage of me. The slip of paper bearing the plate number and other contact details (in case of complaints) handed out to me by the personnel manning the Help Desk booth at the airport did not bother the driver a bit. As soon as I hopped into an old model taxicab in queue, the young unscrupulous driver automatically demanded if I could add more to the taximeter. He likewise asked me for directions to my place. Just imagine if I were a newcomer to the city. As regards his demand for additional fare, I chided him to bring me first to my destination before asking for add-on fare. Being tired from the day’s delayed trip from Tacloban, I opted not to argue anymore. How could I, with three bags in tow by my lonesome? And how much did it cost me from Terminal 4 to Quezon City? I was sucked with my hard-earned P400, which was P100 more than what was on the meter. Aside from that, I couldn’t fully relax on my way home for fear of being brought somewhere else. This shocking experience is uncommon with Uber or Grab cars. The latter offers me, in all circumstances, courteous drivers/owners in almost all brand-new vehicles. Can you blame me if I prefer Uber and Grab over regular taxicabs?  With these, I am totally opposed to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board’s silly and indecisive decision to hamper Grab and Uber from their operations. The riding public is at the losing end with such an illogical move to clamp down hard on said service while turning a blind eye to the poor commuters’ plight. A challenge remains to LTFRB officials to simply give the riding public a better option. For now, Grab and Uber remain the preferred choice. Nonnegotiable.

But the San Francisco-based company’s brief tussle with transportation regulators, prompted by complaining taxicab operators and countered by the overwhelming tide of public opinion favoring the app, may mean one thing: that Uber is here to stay.  That’s good news for regular users like Maria Arlyssa Narciso, who was left with a hair-raising experience following a Dec. 6 taxicab ride using a smartphone booking app and Uber rival. Narciso, who works at Bank of the Philippine Islands and owns online crafts store Happy Buttons, said she was making the trip from Cainta, Rizal, to Shaw (Uber only operates in Metro Manila today) when she discovered during the trip her clean-looking cab was carrying some unwanted guests.  Pest “To my horror and surprise, I felt and saw a small cockroach climb on my foot. I swiped it off and stepped on it immediately. Then suddenly a swarm came out from under the backseat,” Narcisco recounted.  “I asked the driver if I can just pay and get off before my original destination because there were just too many cockroaches.

Uber vehicles are privately owned and are not subject to stringent regulations, and the costs that come with these explain why some cabs fall short when compared with Uber cars, they said. Platform, not transpo firm Uber, which was formally launched in the Philippines last February, likes to stress that it is not a transportation company but a platform that allows passengers to link up with drivers of private vehicles looking to make extra cash.  Transactions between passengers and drivers are credit card-based, allowing an extra layer of security and convenience for that relatively small part of the population with this kind of access. One of Uber’s main draws is its ease of use. A rider downloads the app, registers and he or she can begin by selecting the service, setting a pickup point and then being connected to a nearby driver, whom the passenger can call or text. (See sidebar, How to use Uber.) Vehicle tracking, new cars The Uber platform also allows vehicles to be tracked via satellite, allowing users to let friends and family monitor their route and exact position. Safety features like these drew Louie Rey, a Senate employee, to Uber over the last four months. Uber drivers use “new” and have well-maintained cars and are “courteous,” helping boost the experience, he said. “What I don’t like with the taxi is that usually the car is dilapidated, the air-con is not functioning properly and the driver complains,” Rey said. Rey’s typical Uber journey going home from work involves fetching his wife in the Makati financial district before heading to SM Group’s Mall of Asia complex in Pasay. There, Rey and his spouse take a commuter van the rest of the way to Cavite, where they reside. “Unfortunately, Cavite is not yet covered by Uber. If it is, then we would use Uber on a regular basis,” he said. Predictability Uber’s predictability is also a key feature. For business owner Elliot Artuz, knowing how much his fare will cost for a desired destination makes Uber a good taxicab alternative.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “There’s no need to negotiate any rates,” said Artuz, who owns and drives his own car but occasionally uses Uber, especially during emergency situations. “You’re assured that the driver won’t cheat.” Some cab operators have been known to resort to “contracted” or fixed rates before accepting a passenger. Many passengers end up agreeing to these rates, which are usually higher, because they are running late. Rey recounted a recent incident when a cab driver asked for P250 for a trip from Pasay Rotunda to Ninoy Aquino International Airport, where he and his spouse had to catch a flight. “Of course we ended up booking Uber for a lot less fare of P70,” he said. In other stories, the passengers were less fortunate as indicated in news reports on taxicab drivers allegedly raping or robbing their victims. Rare cases But Jesus Manuel “Bong” C. Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, said these reports often left out the fact that these were very rare cases and should not be used to cast the entire industry in a negative light. “There are 27,000 franchised taxi vehicles in Metro Manila—that translate to more than a million passenger pickups per day,” Suntay said, noting that the complaints per day were relatively small compared with the size of the sector. Nevertheless, Uber’s “disruptive” business model has been successful because it has correctly identified the demand for better and safer transportation alternatives. UberBlack, UberX(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The company has even tailored its services further, giving riders the option to link up with drivers using more high-end vehicles with the “UberBlack” service or the more affordable “UberX.” Its website showed that Manila UberX vehicles include models like Toyota Vios and Honda City, with the base fare pegged at P40, plus a per minute charge of P2 and a per kilometer charge of P5.70. A passenger can cancel the ride for P100. Vehicles for UberBlack, whose base fare is P90 and the per km charge is more than double that of UberX at P12.92, includes the larger Toyota Fortuner and Ford Everest. Other UberBlack vehicles include Subarus and Mini Coopers, making this option a “classier” way to get around Metro Manila, one regular rider said. 200 cities, 51 countries Differentiated services like these have helped Uber grow worldwide at breakneck speed. It started in 2009 and is now present in over 200 cities and 51 countries. [Recently, several countries, including India, have banned Uber.] Recent reports indicated that the company could be worth as much as $40 billion, based on a fresh round of fund-raising. To put that in perspective, Uber was worth around $17 billion last June, indicating how investors feel about the company’s prospects. The growth story appears to be just as rapid in the Philippines although Uber did not disclose any figures. Protests “In Manila, the response we have received both from riders and drivers has far exceeded our expectations and we continue to see tremendous growth,” Karun Arya, Uber communications lead-South Asia, said in an e-mail. As in the Philippines, Uber has been met with several protests, mainly from taxicab operators in other parts of the globe.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The arguments were similar: that the company is operating illegal taxi operations, is unfair to regulated industries and even compromises passenger safety, including a recent case in New Delhi, India, where a female passenger alleged she was raped by an Uber driver. “Uber as a tech company admitted that they don’t own any vehicles and don’t employ any drivers. Taxicab operators, on the other hand, are required to own their vehicles, employ their own drivers, secure franchises and pay regulatory fees,” said Suntay, adding that fares are regulated for taxicabs but not for Uber. With costs adding up, it would take at least five years to get their money back on a single cab, meaning they would need to use the vehicle for a longer period to earn profits, Suntay said. He noted that while this explained why certain taxis were “old” and continued to operate, they were not making excuses for operators. Level playing field “The only thing we are asking for is a level playing field and for Uber vehicles to be regulated,” Suntay said. The controversy is not limited to its business model. The company was recently criticized in the United States over comments reportedly made by one of its senior executives on how the firm could finance smear campaigns against critical journalists and how Uber workers could access customers’ private travel information. Uber has distanced itself from those comments, saying that employees are prohibited from accessing a rider’s private data. Arrest, netizens react(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  For a time, Uber’s model has stayed below the regulator’s radar. But things came to a head last October when the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) announced that an Uber driver had been arrested in a sting operation. The driver was reportedly fined P200,000—which is the applicable amount for operating that vehicle without the necessary government franchise. That act drew widespread condemnation, mainly directed at the LTFRB and taxi operator groups that lodged the complaints. The criticism came loudest from netizens who cited the shortcomings of government-regulated services. Damage control Within a week, the transportation department launched some “damage-control” initiatives and said it was keen on working with Uber and other technology-related solutions to improve transportation conditions for passengers. Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya later followed this up with a stronger statement aimed at taxicab operators. “Commuters say they feel safer taking these private vehicles for hire, that the fleet are newer, that app services are faster and more efficient. So why put a stop to what is clearly for their benefit? Poorer services should be upgraded to match their competition—not the other way around,” Abaya said. “So, my advice to taxi operators: modernize, innovate, and improve your systems and services,” he added. Some operators of public transport vehicles understood how Uber’s model was attractive even if it was hurting their business.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Long wait for franchises An individual, who runs a UV Express business but declined to be named since he has pending applications with the LTFRB, said the difficulty in securing franchises and long waiting time meant that operators were losing money before their cars could leave the garage. Others end up operating ahead of their license, which would make the vehicles colorum or illegal, while others turn to Uber. Uber’s Arya said this shift was a global trend. “New drivers can start their own small business and existing transportation providers can increase the utilization of their time and their assets, and enjoy added flexibility. In fact, in cities around the world, former taxi drivers are choosing the Uber platform for these very reasons,” he said in his e-mail. The Philippine government, meanwhile, has since been playing catch-up in terms of its rules.  Hearing Last Nov. 24, the LTFRB held a formal hearing that included representatives from Uber and other taxicab alternatives as well as from the taxi groups themselves. LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez said that the board would need to review position papers filed by all stakeholders before its revised guidelines accommodating solutions like Uber and other technology apps were out. Early on, the regulator identified the existing vehicles-for-hire category as the likely classification for Uber cars.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Ride-sharing app No new arrest has been made since October even as the LTFRB has warned private drivers that they can charge money for these applications before the rules are out “at their own risk.” In fact, more players are entering the market. Last month, Tripda, a ride-sharing app under Germany’s Rocket Internet focusing on carpooling, was launched in the Philippines. For BPI’s Narciso, taxicab operators have the upper hand today because of their bigger numbers in terms of cars, but services like Uber will continue to eat into their share as long as the market demands it. “It’s a free market and consumers are paying. Why should they and the taxi operators take that away from us? It’s a healthy competition. It pushes them to innovate and improve their services,” Narciso said. “It shouldn’t always be about profit since those [taxi] units in the metro are poorly maintained anyway. I’d let them take the profit if I get the quality of service that I’m paying for,” she said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/998528/honolulu-leaders-approve-1st-ride-hailing-price-cap-in-us-uber-lyft-ride-hailing-world-news-transportation","title":"Honolulu leaders approve 1st ride-hailing price cap in US","date":"02:49 PM June 07, 2018","snippet":"HONOLULU—Honolulu leaders approved a measure Wednesday to limit prices that ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft can charge during peak demand, a cap that the companies say would be the first restriction of its kind in the United States.","body":"HONOLULU—Honolulu leaders approved a measure Wednesday to limit prices that ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft can charge during peak demand, a cap that the companies say would be the first restriction of its kind in the United States. The measure would prevent “surge pricing” if increased rates are higher than the maximum fare set by the city. Honolulu attorneys will review the measure before it goes to Mayor Kirk Caldwell, who would have 10 days to sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature or veto it.  Uber sent emails to customers across the island of Oahu, which is where the rule would apply, urging them to oppose the rules that would impose “outdated taxi-style requirements on rideshare.” Oahu taxi drivers have been at odds with those who drive for mobile apps that connect riders with nearby drivers. Taxi companies complain that companies such as Uber and Lyft create an unfair playing field because they face fewer restrictions.  Uber has been told the city hasn’t received any consumer complaints about surge pricing, said Tabatha Chow, the company’s senior operations manager for Hawaii. Honolulu has the highest taxi prices in the nation and Uber is 40 percent cheaper, she told council members Wednesday. Surge pricing only happens during peak times such as rush hour, weekend nights and big events, she said, adding that fares go back down when more drivers are on the road.  If Uber and Lyft rides are cheaper, then why do they need to use surge pricing, asked Robert Deluze, owner of Robert’s Taxis, who said ride-hailing companies have hurt the taxi business. Councilwoman Kymberly Marcos Pine, who voted for the limits, said she was concerned to hear that U.S. Navy sailors getting off ships in Pearl Harbor recently were charged as much as $221 to get to Waikiki when a cab ride was $44. As the wife of a sailor, she said she wants to protect service members from being “price gouged.” Uber said in a fact sheet that surge pricing gives drivers the incentive to work in busier areas, which lowers wait times for riders and ensures reliability. Riders and drivers who submitted testimony opposing the measure said taxis aren’t as reliable or affordable as ride-hailing companies. Uber driver Lisa Gonzales wrote that she drives to help support her family of six. During surge pricing, passengers have the option to accept or reject costs, she said, and that it’s based on supply and demand.  Uber and Lyft officials testified in City Council committees last month that the cap on surge pricing would be the first such restriction on the companies in the country, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. “When demand for rides is greater than the number of drivers on the road, passengers may pay an extra percentage on top of the base ride amount,” Lyft said in a statement explaining its “Prime Time” pricing. A $6 ride would become a $9 ride during Prime Time pricing of 50 percent, the statement said, adding that it “only adds a percentage to the ride subtotal, which is calculated before any other fees or additional amounts.” Council Chairman Ernie Martin said he wrote the measure to ensure consumers won’t pay an “unreasonable price.” He said companies will still be able to employ surge pricing — or as he prefers to call it, “predatory pricing” — within limits. The measure would set precedence nationwide, he said: “Other cities are struggling with this as well.” The city’s Department of Customer Services would be tasked with setting the maximum price. Deputy Director Randy Leong told council members that the department opposes setting the threshold but will do so if it becomes law. It’s difficult to dictate to businesses what they may charge, he said. Uber released a statement after the vote saying that, if implemented, the bill will limit consumer choice and put the availability of Uber service on Oahu at risk. /jpv"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/241655/uber-admits-ph-users-data-exposed","title":"Uber admits some PH users’ data exposed","date":"05:05 AM November 29, 2017","snippet":"The personal information of a yet undetermined number of Filipino Uber users have been compromised in a breach late last year, a hack that the company’s US office deliberately hid from the public for more than a year.","body":"The personal information of a yet undetermined number of Filipino Uber users have been compromised in a breach late last year, a hack that the company’s US office deliberately hid from the public for more than a year. This is according to the National Privacy Commission (NPC), which said that Uber Philippines wrote to the agency on Monday to confirm that data on Filipino users were among those compromised in the hacking in October last year.  It was uncertain how Uber could confirm this while it had claimed it could not give the extent of the impact of the data breach.Regardless of whether the data were used for fraud and other purposes or not, NPC said concealing the breach “bears serious consequences” under the law. “In that letter, Uber confirmed to us that personal information of Filipinos were exposed in the data breach,” Privacy Commissioner Raymund Liboro said in the statement.  “Unfortunately, Uber failed to provide the details that we expect from personal information controllers about data breach notifications, such as the actual number of Filipinos affected, and the scope of their exposure.” It has been more than a week since Uber Technologies Inc. admitted that it was hacked in October 2016, with “some personal information of 57 million Uber users” all over the world compromised. How this impacted Filipino users remains uncertain, even to the NPC.  While the ridesharing company assured the public that necessary actions had been made, Uber still purposely hid the information from the public until months into the term of its newest chief executive officer. Uber Philippines, for its part, claimed it did not have prior knowledge about the breach. “While Uber has repeatedly asserted that there has been no evidence of fraud or misuse tied to the incident, the concealment of a data breach bears serious consequences under the Data Privacy Act of 2012,” Liboro said. Under the Data Privacy Act of 2012, concealing security breaches that involve sensitive personal information face a penalty that could reach up to five years of imprisonment and a fine of about P500,000. The necessary punishments, according to the law, would be slapped on people who—after learning about the breach—decided to conceal the fact, whether done intentionally or by omission. “If so qualified, those responsible for the concealment of the breach and for the exfiltration of the data may face serious civil and criminal liability,” Liboro said.  NPC is cooperating with its counterpart authorities in Australia and the United States on this matter, he added. Uber representatives deferred from commenting on the issue, even when asked about the number of its active Uber users to-date. In an information page under the “Accounts and Payment” option menu in the help section of the app, Uber said “we do not believe an individual rider needs to take any action,” Uber said in its app. According to the blog post made by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, the hackers were able to download names,e-mail addresses and mobile phone numbers of users across the globe and the driver’s license numbers of drivers in the United States. Other pieces of data were not breached, The company said no other piece of data was stolen. Later, news organizations reported that Uber paid hackers $100,000 to destroy the stolen data. Liboro said Uber had claimed there was “no indication” that any information on Filipino drivers’ licenses were downloaded."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/253348/airbnb-uber-woes-show-japan-not-share-easily","title":"Airbnb, Uber woes show Japan does not share easily","date":"04:44 PM July 01, 2018","snippet":"","body":""},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/203649/qc-judge-stops-dotc-new-permits-for-uber-grabcar","title":"QC judge stops DOTC new permits for Uber, GrabCar","date":"05:43 AM December 05, 2015","snippet":"A Quezon City court has ordered a 20-day suspension of the implementation of a Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) order permitting the app-based ride-sharing companies Uber and GrabCar to operate in Metro Manila.","body":"A Quezon City court has ordered a 20-day suspension of the implementation of a Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) order permitting the app-based ride-sharing companies Uber and GrabCar to operate in Metro Manila. Judge Santiago Arenas of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 217 issued the 20-day temporary restraining order (TRO) in connection with the petition filed by Stop and Go, a coalition of taxi operators and drivers.  The court blocked the DOTC from accepting further applications of app-enabled transport services, pending its decision after it hears on Dec. 8 the Stop and Go petition to ban them in the capital. “There is extreme urgency to issue a temporary restraining order to the petitioner to prevent grave and irreparable injury and damages because of their claim that they suffer less or low incomes and earnings is found to be persuasive,” said the court.  Judge Arenas clarified that the TRO does not apply to the existing operations of Uber and GrabCar. The TRO applies only to future applications and not the current operations of Uber and GrabCar, Arenas said.  “How can I include Uber and Grab, they are not impleaded as a party,” Arenas told the Inquirer as he lamented the negative comments he received on social media. “The TRO only seeks to restrain the government offices not to accept applications in the meantime,” Arenas said. “No further implementation of the order and circulars because their legality is being taken up in court,” he said. The court order also does not affect Uber and GrabCar operations in Cebu, the country’s second largest city, where the government has allowed Uber to operate 10 vehicles to help meet public transport demand during the Christmas season. The TRO covers the DOTC order which created the categories transportation network company (TNC) for the technology provider and transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) for the unit operators.  The court order also suspended the related guidelines issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The court order, dated Nov. 27, also suspended the accepting, processing and approval of TNVS applications. Stop and Go president Jun Magno, who received the court order on Thursday, hailed the TRO as an “initial victory.” “We just want the process to be equal,” Magno said. He questioned the “unlimited” applications for TNVS while there is a moratorium on issuance of franchises for other public utility vehicles. The Stop and Go petition claimed that Uber and GrabCar were given special treatment to operate without a franchise. “The income of taxi drivers was slashed by up to 50 percent because of the app-based transport, which does not follow tariffs imposed by the government,” Magno said. About 660,000 taxis ply their trade in Metro Manila, the Asian Development Bank estimated in 2010. Magno said Stop and Go was only questioning the operations of Uber and GrabCar. “If there are complications in the department order, the DOTC or the solicitor general can clarify it with the court,” he said. Transport Secretary Joseph Abaya said he had first to see a copy of the TRO and its contents before he could comment. LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez yesterday said the board had not yet received the court order.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “The subject of the case, as far as I know, is TNVS. It has to be clarified with the court which aspects of the [department order] are being restrained. As you said, there are other denominations included in the [order],” Ginez said. The department order also covers the transport denominations of rapid bus transit, airport bus and premium taxi. Ginez said the LTFRB would comply with the court order and would request the Office of the Solicitor General to study the available legal remedies. On the issue of “unlimited” TNVS, Ginez said it was a policy issue as the moratorium was limited to existing transport denominations while the TNCs and TNVS were a new innovation. As of Nov. 9, the LTFRB has received 7,304 TNVS applications. Of the total, 5,660 are with Uber while 1,644 are with GrabCar. In a statement, Uber said the company was aware of the court decision and would study its implications on their partner vehicles. “Uber was not a party to the proceedings that resulted in the court’s decision and plans to coordinate closely with the DOTC and LTFRB,” it said. The Philippines was the first country to regulate these types of app-based services, to help make up for inadequate mass transport in Manila, Southeast Asia’s second most congested city after Jakarta, according to research firm Numbeo.

Who will pay for the cost to operate?  In an order released on Saturday, the PCC said the two transportation network companies (TNCs) should “maintain the independence of their business operations” for the “entire duration” of the commission’s motu propio review on the deal. The PCC, however, did not state when it intends to conclude its review. The PCC order came a day before the Uber app is scheduled to go offline, which is on Sunday, April 8.  Early this week, PCC and LTFRB officials met to discuss what would become of the ride-sharing industry with Uber’s exit from the Southeast Asian region. Lizada said that they stressed in that meeting that safety measures have been put in place by the board “to prevent any monopoly by any TNC,” which the PCC fears would happen.  For one, she noted, there are currently four new TNCs that have sought accreditation from the LTFRB. Once these TNCs – Lag Go, Hype, Owto and Pira – satisfy the LTFRB’s requirements, they will take the place of Uber, affording the riding public more transport options. Also, she said that TNCs could not increase their fares on their own as they are required to follow the fare structure approved by the LTFRB. As for the app-based drivers, the franchises that are given to them by the LTFRB are not exclusive to any TNC, which means that they get to decide on who they want to drive for. Rather than unbundle the deal entered by the two TNCs, Lizada said that LTFRB should instead be “called [out] to fast-track the processing of the new players.” It remains unclear how the PCC intends to enforce its order on Uber, especially that its employees are already on a four-month garden leave. The Inquirer also learned that Uber has only around 10 employees left in the country who are part of the transition team.  The Inquirer sought both Uber and Grab officials for comment on the PCC’s order but has yet to receive a reply as of writing. On Friday, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu assured the National Privacy Commission that there would be no migration to their platform of the personal data of the 1.2 million Uber users, which may include credit card details. He noted that the data which would be transferred to them are only those of the drivers, who would have to give their consent to Grab. /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248514/grab-uber-deal-create-monopoly","title":"Grab-Uber deal to create ‘monopoly’","date":"05:13 AM April 03, 2018","snippet":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm Grab next week, the Philippine antitrust body has urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market.","body":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm Grab next week, the Philippine antitrust body has urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said that it was considering to review the deal regardless if the transaction fell under the current notification rules for mergers and acquisitions (M&As).  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the biggest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. Grab said the Uber app, which provided an alternative to many Filipinos suffering from worsening public transportation services, would no longer be functional from April 9 onward. “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-hailing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said.  PCC, which reviews business deals and sees which ones are anticompetitive, said that its officials were scheduled to meet with Grab and Uber representatives yesterday. It was not clear if the PCC statement preceded or followed that meeting. The acquisition would likely have a “far-reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services,” according to PCC. In light of this, the competition watchdog said it was looking into the deal “with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns.”  During the review, PCC would evaluate how certain factors would play out after the acquisition. These factors include price increases, quality of ride-hailing services and the likelihood of having other transport network companies (TNCs) compete in the market. PCC said the review could happen in two ways: Through both parties submitting the deal for review if certain requirements are met, and through PCC opening a review on its own, even if the notification requirements for M&As were not met. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet a certain threshold in terms of value and assets. A notification is required when both standards are met: One of the companies in the deal is worth more than P5 billion, and the aggregate value of the assets of the acquired company exceeds P2 billion. Both ride-hailing firms could not act on the deal without PCC approval, assuming that the transaction is notifiable. As of press time, PCC said that it did not know yet the terms and conditions of the deal. But even if it was not notifiable, “Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns,” PCC said. Nevertheless, PCC called the consultation with the TNC representatives as a “sign” of willingness to comply to the Philippine Competition Act."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/201444/taxing-uber-bir-mulls-requiring-drivers-to-issue-receipts","title":"Taxing Uber: BIR mulls requiring drivers to issue receipts","date":"01:11 PM October 27, 2015","snippet":"‘Uber’ rides are set to get a lot less convenient for the public as tax authorities plan to mandate the issuance of physical receipts—a rule ignored by most taxi operators.","body":"‘Uber’ rides are set to get a lot less convenient for the public as tax authorities plan to mandate the issuance of physical receipts—a rule ignored by most taxi operators.

Earlier, the PCC ordered Uber to continue its services beyond April 8, delaying Grab’s takeover of its operations in the country. Separate, independent  The PCC directed the two TNCs to maintain separate and independent operations pending its review of the deal between the ride-hailing firms. According to Cu, they decided to extend the operations of the Uber app until April 15 as they expect to meet with PCC officials this week to further discuss the March 25 deal which resulted in Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia and gave it a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s operations in the region.  Cu said that since March 25, Grab has footed the cost of its rival app’s operations in Southeast Asia as drivers and riders migrated to its platform. He pointed out that if the PCC would insist that Uber continue operating during the review, this would “diminish the point of what they want us to do.” According to Cu, the PCC does not seem to understand the premise of Uber’s extension of its operations in Singapore for another week. Uber’s premise “The premise [of Uber’s April 15 extension in Singapore] was to help in the transition, not to create an indefinite operational structure for a company that has already left the region,” he said.  Leo Gonzales, Grab Philippines public affairs head, pointed out that even if the Uber app continued to operate in the country, the PCC should realize there was no back-end support left to take care of passenger complaints and safety issues in the event of an accident. This was also the issue raised by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) which said that since the signing of the deal, only two Uber employees remained in the country to work on the transition. Cu also said that the PCC’s worry that Grab’s acquisition of Uber would create a “virtual monopoly” of the ride-sharing industry was a matter best left to the LTFRB. Let LTFRB decide “Unlike other companies, we are governed by the LTFRB. We fully trust … that it is operating in the best interest of the riding public. If PCC thinks [the deal is] detrimental to the riding public, they should take it up with LTFRB,” he said. Currently, the LTFRB is in the process of accrediting three new TNCs. A fourth TNC has expressed interest in joining the ride-hailing industry although it has yet to submit an application for accreditation. Cu maintained that even if Uber was now a part-owner of Grab, there was “no integration of operations as it remained separate, and we’re not assuming control of the Uber app.” He explained that even if Grab was funding the app’s operations, the system was still being handled by Uber’s main office in the United States."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/197481/bir-looking-into-tax-compliance-of-uber-drivers","title":"BIR looking into tax compliance of Uber drivers","date":"07:51 PM August 19, 2015","snippet":"The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has started discussing with transport authorities ways to better track tax payments of transportation network companies or TNCs like Uber and their drivers, Commissioner Kim S.

Jacinto-Henares told the Philippine Daily Inquirer on Wednesday. “We are coordinating and discussing with LTFRB [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board],” Henares said in a text message when asked if the BIR was also looking into tax compliance as well as tracking payments of Uber drivers.  Such drivers are considered non-fixed income earners. They issue receipts to their customers online. Henares said the BIR might soon come out with a regulation covering drivers of Uber vehicles and other TNCs, “if needed.”  The feisty BIR chief reminded Uber and TNCs that all business enterprises have tax dues that must be paid correctly. “Like any business, they are covered by the laws of taxation of entities engaged in business—from registration to issuance of receipts, to filing and payment of taxes,” she pointed out.  “They are engaged in the provision of services and are covered by all the provisions of the Tax Code for business engaged in the provision of services,” Henares added. The LTFRB also on Wednesday approved the application of online-based transportation service provider Uber as an accredited TNC.

The Wall Street Journal said Tuesday that Uber Technologies Inc. received valuation proposals from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. There is no guarantee Uber will fetch that valuation, or go public soon.  If it does, and at that price, the company would be worth more than Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles combined. There are hurdles for Uber, past and present. In addition to a series of scandals including workplace sexual harassment, theft of intellectual property and the ouster of its co-founder, the company is facing increasing competition. /ee "},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/198920/uber-deal-seen-boosting-pldt-e-commerce-concern","title":"Uber deal seen boosting PLDT e-commerce concern","date":"05:33 AM September 11, 2015","snippet":"Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., revealing details of its long-term strategy with ride-sharing app Uber, said it aimed to bolster its e-commerce business through the new payment methods for Uber users.","body":"Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., revealing details of its long-term strategy with ride-sharing app Uber, said it aimed to bolster its e-commerce business through the new payment methods for Uber users. At present, Uber transactions in the Philippines are made through credit cards, which cover between 3 and 4 percent of the country’s total population of about 100 million people.  The agreement with PLDT enables Uber passengers to pay their fares using PLDT’s Smart e-money platform and their ATM cards, Ernesto Alberto, PLDT executive vice-president and ePLDT president, said in a briefing. Alberto said the Smart e-money platform had about two million users while ATM holders in the Philippines number between 22 million and 24 million people.  “We are working on the Smart money as well as ATMs. This is the natural progression in terms of expanding the footprint,” he said. He did not comment on the timing but added that the two platforms would expand the base to about 20 to 25 percent of the population.  Uber itself is looking at other payment options in the Philippines, including cash-based transactions, said Mike Brown, Uber regional general manager, Southeast Asia and Australia, New Zealand. Cash payments would allow Uber to compete with rivals GrabCar and regular taxi services more broadly. “We recently rolled out cash in Vietnam as a payment option with excellent results,” Brown said. PLDT this week announced a multi-year strategic agreement with Uber. The partnership initially involves providing Uber cars with PLDT and Smart’s Internet services, which would be made available to passengers for free."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/270231/uber-shifts-into-lower-gear-prices-ipo-at-45","title":"Uber shifts into lower gear, prices IPO at $45","date":"06:41 AM May 10, 2019","snippet":"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber is about to embark on a wild ride on Wall Street with the biggest and most hotly debated IPO in years.","body":"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber is about to embark on a wild ride on Wall Street with the biggest and most hotly debated IPO in years. The world’s leading ride-hailing service set the stage for its long-awaited arrival on the stock market by pricing its initial public offering at $45 per share late Thursday.  The price is at the lower end of its targeted range of $44 to $50 per share, a decision that may have been driven by the escalating doubts about the ability of ride-hailing service’s ability to make money since Uber’s main rival, Lyft, went public six weeks ago. Even at the tamped-down price, Uber now has a market value of $82.4 billion – significantly more than century-old automakers General Motors and Ford Motor.  Uber will face its next test Friday when its shares begin trading the New York Stock Exchange. No matter how the stock swings, the IPO has to be considered a triumph for the company most closely associated with a ride-hailing industry that has changed the way millions of people get around while also transforming the way millions of more people earn a living in the gig economy.  The IPO raised another $8.1 billion for Uber as it tries to fend off rival Lyft in the U.S. and help cover the cost of giving rides to passengers at unprofitable prices. The San Francisco company already has lost about $9 billion since its inception and acknowledges it could still be years before it turns a profit. That sobering reality is one reason that Uber fell well short of reaching the $120 billion market value that many observers believed its IPO might attain earlier this year. Another factor working against Uber is the cold shoulder that investors have been giving Lyft’s stock after an initial run-up. Lyft’s shares closed Thursday 23% below its IPO price of $72 in April. The jitters about an intensifying U.S. trade war with China also have roiled the stock market this week. Despite all that, Uber’s IPO is the biggest since Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group debuted with a value of $167.6 billion in 2014. “For the market to give you the value, you’ve either got to have a lot of profits or potential for huge growth,” said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research.  And Uber boasts growth galore. Its revenue last year surged 42% to $11.3 billion while its cars completed 5.2 billion trips around the world either giving rides to 91 million passengers or delivering food. Uber might be even more popular if not for a series of revelations about unsavory behavior that sullied its image and resulted in the ouster of its co-founder, Travis Kalanick, as CEO nearly two years ago. The self-inflicted wounds included complaints about rampant internal sexual harassment, accusations that it stole self-driving car technology, and a cover-up of a computer break-in that stole personal information about its passengers. What’s more, some Uber drivers have been accused of assaulting passengers, and one of its self-driving test vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona last year while a backup driver was behind the wheel. Uber hired Dara Khosrowshahi as CEO to replace Kalanick and clean up the mess, something that analysts said has been able to do to some extent, although Lyft seized upon the scandals to gain market share. Kalanick remains on Uber’s board, although he isn’t expected to be on the podium to help ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange to herald the company’s debut Friday. Instead, he is expected to be on the trading floor, perhaps savoring his newfound wealth. At $45 per share, Kalanick’s stake in Uber will be worth $5.3 billion. Hundreds, if not thousands, of other Uber employees are expected to become millionaires in the IPO. Meanwhile, scores of Uber drivers say they have been mistreated by the company as they work long hours and wear out their cars picking up passengers as they struggle to make ends meet. On Wednesday, some of them participated in strikes across the United States to highlight their unhappiness ahead of Uber’s IPO but barely caused a ripple. A similar strike was organized ahead of Lyft’s IPO to the same effect. Uber may be able to avoid Lyft’s post-IPO stock decline because it has a different story to tell other than the potential for growth in ride-hailing, says Alejandro Ortiz, principal analyst with SharesPost. Uber, he said, has plans to be more than a ride-hailing company by being all things transportation to users of its app, offering deliveries, scooters, bicycles and links to other modes of transportation including public mass transit systems. “Whether or not that pitch will work kind of remains to be seen. It’s nearly impossible to tell now,” he said. “Obviously the risk to the company now is they have a lot more shareholders that they have to convince.” /kga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/229301/uber-chases-grabtaxi-myanmar-expanding-southeast-asia","title":"Uber chases GrabTaxi in Myanmar, expanding in Southeast Asia","date":"04:46 PM May 11, 2017","snippet":"YANGON, Myanmar — The private ride-hailing service Uber officially launched operations Thursday in Myanmar’s main city Yangon, aiming to tap into one of the world’s youngest and fastest-growing online markets.","body":"YANGON, Myanmar — The private ride-hailing service Uber officially launched operations Thursday in Myanmar’s main city Yangon, aiming to tap into one of the world’s youngest and fastest-growing online markets. The launch follows Singapore-based GrabTaxi’s debut, which began a trial run in the Southeast Asian country about six weeks ago.  Uber is one of the world’s largest on-demand transportation platforms. It is seeking an alliance with the government to smooth acceptance of the use of private vehicles for commercial transport. A taxi ride in Myanmar usually involves negotiating prices, no use of meters and a lack of air conditioning or seat belts. Using a ride-hailing app is still a relatively new concept, though the practice has been gaining in popularity.  Local travel services start-up Oway and Hello Cabs, a rival service run by a construction and auto dealership tycoon, also provide ride-hailing services. “I definitely want to try Uber,” said Nyan Zay Htet, a company worker who was haggling with a driver over a fare on a downtown street in Yangon. “I welcome having international companies come in because it can be more convenient for us if we don’t have to bargain over prices and can just hop in and go.”  Some taxi drivers, however, expressed alarm about other companies edging onto their turf. “My car is my livelihood,” said Tun Mya, who said he was already earning less because people were hailing fewer traditional taxis. “I am a bit worried … I don’t know what will happen yet, but we are watching,” he said. More than two-thirds of Southeast Asians are younger than 40 and the number going online to buy goods and services is soaring. A recent research report by Google and the Singaporean investment arm Temasek put the potential ride-sharing market in six larger regional markets at $13 billion by 2025, up from $2.5 billion in 2015. With more than 50 million people, Myanmar is growing fast and its public transport networks are not keeping up. Taxis are plentiful in Yangon, with local media reporting authorities estimate there are more than 50,000 on the city’s jammed roads. The industry is something of a free-for-all, with non-licensed drivers turning their cars into taxis as they please. But the government has said it intends to crack down on that. Incomes for most people are still low, so price competition may be key.  An online Uber fare estimator put the base fare in Yangon at 1,500 kyats (pronounced chuts) ($1.09) with a minimum charge of 1,800 kyats ($1.31). Uber has faced trouble from regulators in various markets, including China, France, Spain and Mexico. But generally they target services transporting paying customers using private vehicles that are not registered for public transport, not ride-hailing that uses smartphone apps to call licensed taxis. Phyo Min Thein, chief minister of Yangon Region, said the government was welcoming Uber and other ride-hailing companies into the market to improve transportation in the city."}]}
