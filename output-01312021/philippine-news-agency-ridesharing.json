In a statement, Grab said the appointment of Grace Vera Cruz was effective immediately, with her focus currently on promoting synergy between the company’s several services “to better serve customers, driver-partners, merchant-partners, and corporate partners in the Philippines as One Grab.” “She will also drive ‘Grab for Good’ initiatives to contribute to the Philippines’ longer-term socio-economic development,” Grab said. Vera Cruz has had 15 years of business experience. She was previously the managing director of Seawood Resources, a Philippine-based international investment company, and has held key positions in McKinsey & Co., CLSA Exchange Capital, and Shell. She said she was “proud” to join Grab and lauded the company’s charitable activities during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic through the “GrabBayanihan”. “I look forward to working with the team to leverage Grab’s technology and innovation to help Filipino communities safely and sustainably recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic,” Vera Cruz said. Russel Cohen, group managing director for Grab, said he was confident in Vera Cruz’s ability to lead and help its drivers and small businesses to use digital services to “grow and support the Philippines in its economic recovery.” “With Grace’s proven credentials in leadership, operations, and strategy, I’m confident she brings deep expertise and understanding,” Cohen said.

To help provide a continued livelihood to its drivers that would be affected by the suspension of public transport, it said a dedicated shuttle fleet is being eyed to provide transportation to its partners in the medical industry as well as other front liners from its “corporate and merchant partners.” “Grab is also looking into the prospect of having our driver-partners provide mobility solutions to our hospital partners as dedicated shuttle fleet for their medical front liners,” Grab added. For its driver-partners with existing loans, Grab said it is working with financial institutions to extend payment holidays, aside from collecting donations for its “communities” affected by the MECQ. For its GrabFood customers, it said it will provide free delivery for those who will use voucher code “UNLIFREEDEL” with a minimum purchase of PHP550 until Wednesday (August 5), and voucher code “ZERODELFEE” with a minimum purchase of PHP550 from August 6 to 16. “Grabfood will offer free delivery during this period to ensure that they continue to have access to daily meal options for themselves and their loved ones,” Grab said. Moreover, it said GrabFood, as well as GrabMart, will be available daily from 6 a.m. to 12 a.m. –– depending on the availability of its merchant-partner — while GrabExpress remains available 24/7. To ensure that its drivers and couriers remain safe from Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to avoid further infection by identifying those already positive, it said the GrabProtect program will continue to provide free tests for its driver and delivery partners. “In partnership with the National Taskforce Against COVID and the BCDA (Bases Conversion and Development Authority), Grab will continue to provide free tests for its driver and delivery partners to ensure the safety of everyone in the platform and our communities as a whole,” Grab said. On Sunday, President Rodrigo Duterte approved the recommendation to place Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal back into a MECQ from August 4 to 18. During this time, public transportation will again be suspended as well as heightened security in checkpoints that would require individuals to present quarantine passes before they are allowed to pass through.

In a statement on Thursday, a Grab spokesperson said the company’s Safety and Anti-fraud teams regularly monitor and suspend accounts with fake, incomplete and unverified names. As part of such measures, he said the company previously sent out a warning to such users and gave them until February 22 to correctly update their information. “Those who have failed to correctly update their profile have been suspended from the platform. Last 2019, we have already suspended more than 351,000 fake, incomplete, and invalid accounts from the platform,” the statement read. Most recently, he said Grab has suspended a total of 856 accounts as of February of this year due to the same violations. “The anti-fraud team has been continuously identifying multiple accounts that were created and being used by the same user. These initiatives have deterred users who use the platform with ill, fraudulent, and malicious intent,” the statement read. He said aside from violations in relation to fraudulent names, the company also flag users who frequently cancel rides and do not show up to claim food orders for possible account suspension. “This behavior is resulting in loss of opportunities and resources for our driver and delivery-partners,” the statement read. He said users who regularly provide low-ratings to drivers and delivery partners without a reason can also be flagged for possible account suspension. “Low-ratings provided to drivers- and delivery-partners can be disputed by especially if these low-ratings do not include specifics and actionable insights,” the statement said.

The passenger selfie verification, it said, was also being rolled out in other countries, especially in the Southeast Asian market, while audio and video recording were also being tested in select locations. Grab also said its new safety features, meant “solely for purposes of maintaining the safety and security of platform users, and to assist law enforcement on investigations,” follow existing rules on lawful processing of data. However, the NPC, in its recent statement, said Grab has failed to sufficiently identify and assess the risks posed by its new safety measures to the rights and freedoms of its passengers. “Only the risks faced by the company were taken into account,” the NPC said in its privacy impact assessment of Grab’s new measures. Among other issues mentioned by the NPC were Grab’s failure to inform its passengers that the photo, audio, and video files collected by the new systems would be released to police authorities upon request in the event of a dispute, conflict, or complaint, and failing to mention its legal basis in processing collected data. It added that while there was an option for Grab passengers to withdraw consent for in-vehicle audio and video recording, the details on how to do so were “not sufficiently communicated to passengers.” “It was also unclear if and how the data processing will be affected upon such withdrawal of consent,” the NPC said. In the first half of January, Grab began a pilot run of in-vehicle audio and video recording in 180 of its GrabCar vehicles as a safety measure for both its drivers and passengers. Grab’s passenger verification through selfie, meanwhile, was made mandatory by the company in the previous year for “identity verification, safety, and may be used to assist the authorities when required,” according to Grab’s website.

In a letter dated Dec. 9 last year and addressed to Technical Working Group for Motorcycle Taxis Chairman Antonio Gardiola Jr., Grab formally submitted its intention to join the study as “Southeast Asia’s largest and safest bike-ride hailing provider.” “In 2019, it garnered 2.55 million bike rides, with 1.49 million bike driver-partners all over Southeast Asia. Moreover, it boasts a 99.99 percent safety record which is one of the highest among Southeast Asia,” the letter read. Under the revised guidelines on the motorcycle taxi pilot study, the number of riders was capped to a total of 30,000 in Metro Manila and 9,000 in Metro Cebu, with each approved competitor allowed to have 10,000 riders each in the former and 3,000 in the latter. These competitors include one of the country’s pioneers on motorcycle taxis Angkas, and new competitors JoyRide and MoveIt. With the total riders of Angkas numbering to about 27,000, the company filed and won a temporary restraining order against the measure on Monday, which Angkas said may result in the loss of jobs for 17,000 of its riders if enforced. Earlier, the technical working group clarified that the cap on riders was set as a mere sampling size for the study and to prevent a monopoly in the motorcycle taxi market.

Instead, we urge them to bring their legitimate concerns to LTFRB, in dialogue, so that the Board can address them and not hold the riding public hostage by their planned disruptive action,” Delgra said in a statement on Friday. “The LTFRB welcomes constructive criticisms and feedbacks from all stakeholders,” he added. On Monday, TNVS driver groups are expected to temporarily go offline from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. to protest the delays in the processing of applications for certificates of public convenience by the LTFRB.

HPG chief, Brig. Gen. Roberto Fajardo said their mandate is to ensure the safety of the metro’s highways for the benefit of commuters and motorists alike and part of that mandate is to help ensure the smooth and safe flow of traffic in our streets. “We support Angkas, as well as all the transport operators legally franchised by the LTFRB, because it is a service that helps the commuters in safely going to and from their destinations. The HPG and Angkas have the same objective and therefore we need to support each other,” Fajardo told reporters during the press briefing for the turnover of Angkas’ donation of 50 brand-new, high-quality helmets to the HPG, which was held at the HPG office in Camp Crame, Quezon City. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) recently gave the green light to implement the pilot run of Angkas in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu for six months starting this June. Prior to this, the DOTr organized a Technical Working Group to discuss and conduct studies of Angkas’ operations, particularly its safety training program for their motorcycle rider-partners. The pilot run aims to assess the safety level of motorcycle taxis and was recommended by a technical working group created by DOTr to study the issue of legalizing motorcycles as public utility vehicles. Fajardo said that Angkas bikers have also been participating in the HPG’s own Motorcycle Riders Safety training program. “In their own little way, and in line with Angkas’ social responsibility, they send their own riders to join our safety training,” Fajardo noted. He also commended Angkas’ own safety training program. “Maganda nga ang may training dahil magiging katuwang natin sila, magiging example of a disciplined motorcycle rider,” Fajardo stressed. Fajardo also described the HPG’s partnership with Angkas as a joint effort to work for the benefit of the commuters and the motorists. “We work hand in hand for the safety, security and discipline of the motorists,” he stressed. Fajardo also said that the donated helmets will be part of the HPG riders’ new uniform and will be the perfect tandem for the new BMW motorcycles that the HPG riders will soon be driving. Angkas founder and CEO Angeline Tham talked about their partnership with HPG, saying, “HPG is out every day protecting our streets and since safety is also paramount to Angkas, we join them in their effort to make the street safer for the general public.” According to Angkas Regulatory and Public Affairs head George Royeca, the donation is part of their safety advocacy. “Have always been vocal about the company’s advocacy for the safety of both the bikers and the passengers. Our donation to the HPG is in line with that advocacy, and which we hope will, in some way, contribute to the safety of our friends from the HPG as they patrol our highways and make them safe,” Royeca said. “This is just the start of a partnership with HPG which we hope will expand to cover other areas that promote and improve road safety,” he added. Angkas will retrain its 27,000 accredited biker-partners through rigorous riding skills assessments, written tests, and extensive safety training to ensure they meet very high safety standards in preparation for the pilot operation. It intends to train 2,000 drivers a day. “Currently, we have retrained 12,000 drivers so we still need to train additional 15,000 more to fully train the 27,000 before we can launch the pilot,” said Angkas operations head David Medrana. The company will provide special reflectorized vests with side straps to help bikers become more visible at night and aid passengers in holding on to the biker’s waist. Each vest has the biker’s unique ID number ensuring that only officially-registered bikers can take ride bookings. All Angkas biker-partners and their passengers are also insured for every ride. A feedback mechanism is also installed on its mobile app to closely monitor the performance of drivers and quickly address passenger concerns. Royeca hopes that Congress will be able to pass a law that will legalize motorcycle taxis after the six-month pilot run. “I think even before the six months are over, we hope to refile the bill in Congress and in Senate. We hope to have a very healthy dialogue with the committee on public services in Senate and the committee on transportation in Congress so that we can update them on a regular basis on the operations of the pilot program,” Royeca said. The motorcycle ridesharing firm assured passengers that it will not impose fare increases amid the implementation of its safety features. Motorcycle taxis shall have a fare of PHP50 for the first two kilometers, an additional PHP10 per kilometer until seven kilometers, additional PHP15 for succeeding kilometers, and a surge rate cap of 1.5x in Metro Manila based on the guidelines set by the DOTr. The initial charge will be PHP20 for the first kilometer, an additional PHP20 per kilometer up to eight kilometers, and PHP20 per kilometer for destinations beyond eight kilometers in Metro Cebu.

If these hatchbacks have no documents they fall within the same category as a sedan with no documents, so they were deactivated. We are not singling out hatchbacks just to be clear),” ),” said Grab Philippines president Brian Cu in a press briefing on Tuesday. The official made the statement as Grab deactivated at least 15,000 TNVS drivers since January this year because they have no provisional authorities or certificates of public convenience from the LTFRB. For his part, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III urged hatchback drivers to substitute their units with vehicles that are compliant with its rules and regulations. Delgra said the drivers were given a transition period by the Board to be able to comply with its directive. “Hatchback is not allowed under the rules kasi maliit yung engine (their engines are small). It’s not up to the standards for what a taxi service and TNVS is. So as not to disrupt the service and in consideration of those hatchbacks at the time we allowed a transition for hatchbacks but only until after their franchises would expire,” Delgra told reporters on the sidelines of its hearing on the deactivation of TNVS drivers. The LTFRB has issued a memorandum last year allowing hatchbacks to operate only in Metro Manila with lower rates within a three-year transition period. TNVS applicants are allowed to replace or drop and substitute their accredited vehicles with year 2012 models and up. A group of hatchback drivers conducted a protest caravan from the Quezon City Memorial Circle to the LTFRB head office to oppose the deactivation of TNVS drivers. The Metro Manila Hatchback Community appealed to the LTFRB and Grab to extend general amnesty for their TNVS partners, streamline the application process and extend the application period for new TNVS slots. On Monday, the LTFRB has opened 10,000 new TNVS slots. Grab vowed to provide assistance in the filing of applications for TNVS units through its TNVS Assistance Program at Matrix Creation Events Venue in 11 Malakas St., Diliman, Quezon City which will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. from June 10 to 13 and from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on June 14.

Cu said Grab deactivated 10,000 TNVS drivers who have no documentation such as certificates of public convenience (CPCs) or PAs from January to May. The ridesharing firm deactivated 500 drivers on a weekly basis during that period. He said 3,000 TNVS drivers were saved from deactivation last Monday because they were able to submit proof of PAs and CPCs to the LTFRB. The company earlier announced that 8,000 drivers were set for deactivation on June 10 because they do not have PAs from the Board. Grab said they deactivated the drivers in compliance with the June 7 deadline set by the LTFRB for the application of 20,000 TNVS units, which was opened last December. The company also assured its riders that it will ensure that its fares will still be able to maintain the 2x surge price amid the reduction of the supply of its TNVS units. “Our team will closely monitor that should prices go up, we will adjust fares downwards as we still have commitments to the PCC (Philippine Competition Commission),” Cu said.

Lower number of those are online anytime. It is up for the TNCs to get the majority of those who are not online to go online to serve demand.

Kapag lahat ng nasa system (If all TNVS units on their system) are online, there will be no issue on the lack of supply,” he added. The Board is also opening 10,000 slots for new applications of TNVS units starting June 10 after it opened 20,000 slots last December until June 7. “After getting provisional authority (PA) or certificates of public convenience (CPC), TNVS applicants would then apply for accreditation with any of the active accredited TNCs. Once accredited and active online, they can start to accept bookings. TNVS may be accredited with more than one TNC,” Delgra said. The LTFRB has accredited eight TNCs-- Ipara Technologies and Solutions Inc, Hirna Mobility Solutions Inc, Hype Transport Systems, Inc, Micab Systems Corp., E-Pick Me Up Inc, GoLag, Aztech Solution, and RYD Global. The accreditation of Grab Philippines, which has the biggest share of TNVS units, has yet to be renewed. Data from the LTFRB show that there are 40,522 TNVS units with PAs or CPCs as of May 29. Meanwhile, the LTFRB has issued a show cause order to Grab last Thursday to explain the deactivation of at least 8,000 TNVS drivers without PAs. The ridesharing company is set to appear before a hearing of the Board set on June 11. “The LTFRB regularly sends a report to Grab containing the list of drivers who apply for LTFRB accreditation.

The move was in compliance with the directive of the LTFRB to suspend the fees following its meeting with Grab and other TNCs on Tuesday. The Board has created a technical working group (TWG) composed of representatives from different TNCs to discuss passenger and driver cancellation policies. Grab implemented last April 29 a PHP50 cancellation fee that will be charged to passengers who cancel the ride after five minutes of getting assigned a driver and a PHP50 no show-up fee if a passenger did not show up at the pick-up point within five minutes for GrabCar and three minutes for GrabShare upon the driver’s arrival. A passenger’s account could be suspended for 24 hours if they cancel rides twice in an hour, thrice in a day or a total of five cancellations per week. Drivers will also be locked out of the platform for a temporary period of time if they force passengers to cancel ride bookings without any reason and for being selective of passenger destinations. The ridesharing firm said the new policy aims to reduce unreasonable cancellations by both drivers and passengers. The policy was implemented on a staggered basis for both riders and passengers and is expected to be completed within this month. “We wish to clarify that while Grab has announced the intended implementation of passenger cancellation fees this month, no fees have yet been charged or collected, since actual implementation of the policy was set to start next week,” Hosaka said.

At the same time, we are cognizant of the fact that sometimes, cancellations are necessary during special situations. Our intention in implementing this new policy is to create a better ride-hailing ecosystem, where both passengers and drivers practice the responsible use of the Grab platform,” Grab President Brian Cu said in a statement on Monday. Starting Monday, a PHP 50 cancellation fee will be charged to passengers who cancel the ride after 5 minutes of getting assigned a driver and a PHP 50 no show-up fee if a passenger did not show up at the pick-up point within 5 minutes for GrabCar and 3 minutes for GrabShare upon the driver’s arrival. The cancellation fee will be applied on the next ride booking of a passenger if they paid in cash and will be paid to the driver to reimburse fuel costs and time spent for traveling to the destination point of the rider. A passenger’s account could be suspended for 24 hours if they cancel rides twice in an hour, thrice in a day or a total of 5 cancellations per week. Drivers will also be locked out of the platform for a temporary period of time if they forced passengers to cancel ride bookings without any reason and for being selective of passenger destinations. Grab clarified that fees will not be imposed for the following situations: - Passenger cancels within 5 minutes of getting an assigned driver. - The driver is not moving towards the pick-up point or going to the wrong direction. - Driver takes 15 minutes longer than the first estimated time of arrival. - The driver indicates that he/she has arrived when he/she has not. The firm assured that it will refund any fees that were charged wrongly within 48 hours, when reported via their in-app Help Centre. The new policy will be implemented on a staggered basis for both riders and passengers and is expected to be completed by the end of May. “We will be implementing this initially to the first 10 percent of the riders and drivers with its full implementation set by end May. We will be rolling out official communications for passengers and drivers starting this Monday,” Grab public relations manager Krhizzy Pasigan said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency. The company has notified the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board on the new policy.

PNP Chief, Director General Oscar Albayalde, meanwhile, said the shooting simulator will help enhance the capability of the police on its campaign against criminality amid its preparations for the upcoming mid-term elections in May. “This is a significant and timely addition to our capability and competency programs as we further intensify our campaign against criminality especially in our security preparations for the upcoming national and local elections in May. Also with the ever changing environment where technological innovations are fast emerging, the PNP must be able to keep in step with the changing times,” Albayalde said. It has been noted that drivers and passengers of transport network companies fall victims to robbery, assault, and carnapping. “Equipping PNP-HPG troopers with the right training and equipment will help curb these incidents from happening. This will not only benefit the users of the Grab platform but will also be extended to other road users,” Cu said.

PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said the commission was able to monitor violations of Grab with its pricing commitments over the period from August 10 to November 10 last year. “The monitoring team of the PCC found that there were certain inconsistencies and inaccuracies with the data that was provided as it relates to the price monitoring commitment. Suffice it to say that this prevented the monitor and the PCC monitoring team from carrying out its review of the pricing commitments in an effective way, which results in an unbiased and credible outcome. In that sense, we’ve thought that reviewing the undertaking of Grab, this ran counter to specific procedures of that undertaking,” Bernabe said. The PCC has approved the acquisition of Uber by Grab on Aug. 10, 2018 following the submission of the voluntary commitments by the ride-hailing company. Its voluntary commitments include the improvement of the quality of its service by bringing back market averages for acceptance and cancellation rates, which existed before the merger happened, and its response time to rider complaints. Grab fares shall likewise not have an “extraordinary deviation” from the minimum allowed fares that are set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The PCC has appointed United Kingdom-based auditing firm Smith & Williamson to monitor the compliance of Grab with its voluntary commitments on a quarterly basis for a period of one year. The commission also slapped a PHP16-million penalty on Grab last October for violating the interim measures it has imposed during the review period of their deal with Uber.

In its statement, the firm said it wants to determine the rationale for PCC to impose the maximum penalty. “We assure our passengers that we are charging fares within the range as allowed by the LTFRB,” Grab said in the statement. The PCC issued the fine against Grab last January 22 with the company receiving the notice on January 23.

This, as the department urged the firm to have a dialogue to discuss issues related to its operations as a public transportation service. “The DOTr, LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board), and LTO (Land Transportation Office) respectfully complied with the order of the lower court. Angkas, on the other hand, continues to brazenly defy the order of the Supreme Court. Let’s thresh it out,” the DOTr said in its statement on Thursday. “The issue is not about the perpetual prohibition of motorcycles from serving as public transport. This is not about depriving the commuting public of an alternative mode of transportation. Instead, this is a matter of following the order of the Supreme Court, the same kind of obedience demonstrated by the government to the preliminary injunction of the lower court even if that order was not favorable to it,” it added. The Supreme Court has issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) earlier this month against the decision of the Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court to interfere with Angkas’ operations. It prevented the implementation of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by Judge Carlos Valenzuela of Mandaluyong RTC Branch 213 last August in favor of Angkas, which prohibited the DOTr and LTFRB from apprehending Angkas bikers, who are lawfully engaging in their trade or profession, based on its mobile application and from performing any act that will impede or obstruct the petitioner’s pursuit of its lawful business or trade as owner and operator of the Angkas mobile application. “If Angkas wants to be heard, it should also learn to listen. Nothing good comes out of defying the law because the law, while existing and unamended, must be respected and followed. As we comply with the law, let us work together to improve legislation in the country, we are willing to talk. We are willing to listen,” the statement read. The DOTr explained that some of the issues that needed to be resolved are: the types of motorcycles to be permitted; acceptable travel speed of motorcycles for hire; whether to allow the motorcycles on all roads or be limited only to secondary roads or areas not serviced by large vehicles such as buses or trucks, among others. “Another integral aspect is safety. How do we ensure the safety of passengers? In the unfortunate instance of an accident involving a passenger, who will shoulder all the expenses? If the driver is injured or dies, what will be the motorcycle owner’s accountability? These details should all be thoroughly studied, and as such, the matter will not be resolved with Angkas’ continued flagrant defiance of the high court’s order,” the statement read. DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade has ordered the LTFRB to apprehend Angkas bikers, who deliberately defy the order of the Supreme Court. Angkas bikers and operators proven to have continued their service will be meted a PHP6,000 fine and three-month vehicle impound, and will be blacklisted from securing a franchise with the LTFRB. For its part, Angkas said in an earlier statement that the TRO of the SC will put to risk the livelihood of around 25,000 biker partners that depend on its operations for the daily needs of their families. It also claimed that it has a safety record of 99.997 percent, which may be considered as “a potential model for responsible traffic safety nationwide.” The motorcycle ridesharing firm said it will exert efforts to serve commuters in a safe and efficient manner and legitimize their riders. Motorcycles are not allowed to operate as public transport services under Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code.

Grab completed the transaction legally, and did not violate the interim measures order,” Lawyer Miguel Aguila, Grab's counsel, said in a statement. The ridesharing firm reiterated that its transaction with Uber was done in a legal manner and did not violate the PCC’s orders particularly the maintenance of independent operations and other conditions such as platforms, pricing and payment policies, incentives, promotions, database, onboarding of drivers, among others, prior to the merger on March 25. “Grab and Uber operations in the Philippines remained separate and without any integration nor was there automatic transfer of passenger and drivers’ data. Grab did not take over Uber operations and did not do anything to violate the interim measures after it was put into effect,” Aguila added. He said Uber’s acquisition of an equity stake and board seat in the company was consummated prior to the issuance of the interim measures order. “The interim measures should be interpreted to apply prospectively and should not cover acts already consummated before its issuance,” Aguila said. He said Grab's fares and surge rates are within the minimum allowed fares set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “Grab’s price algorithm, until the LTFRB suspended the time component in its fares, remained the same. The supposed increase in price was affected by the higher incidence of surge, which was driven by the low supply of vehicles and high concentration of demand,” Aguila said.

The parties have until October 29 within which to file their MR,” PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said in a text message to the Philippine News Agency (PNA). PCC, in its decision issued on October 11, imposed a fine of PHP8 million against Grab for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review and another PHP4-million fine for proceeding with the execution of their agreements during the review period.

The commission said both Uber and Grab violated two of its seven-interim measures it has imposed last April. These are maintaining independent business operations and other conditions (platforms, pricing and payment policies, incentives, promotions, database, onboarding of drivers, etc.) prior to the merger on March 25 and refraining from executing any final agreement or contract that will transfer any asset, equity, interest, including the assumption by Uber of a board seat in Grab. Other measures include: refrain from providing access between parties any confidential information (i.e. pricing, formulas, incentives, operations, marketing and sales policies, promotions, customer and driver database); refrain from imposing exclusivity clauses, lock-in periods and/or termination fees to drivers; refrain from acts that may lead to reduced viability and saleability of businesses; refrain from acts that will prejudice the PCC’s power to review the transaction and impose remedies; and refrain from performing any act that may lead and/or further lead to the consummation of the transaction. The commission has approved the acquisition deal last August after Grab has submitted its voluntary commitments to the PCC which includes improving the quality of its service, particularly response time to rider complaints.

And at least we can say that at least we are now 80 percent restoring the pristine beauty and original situation of Boracay Island,” DENR Undersecretary Jonaes Leones said in a Palace press briefing. Leones said the inter-agency task force, led by DENR, is ready to reopen Boracay on Oct. 26 with some safeguards now in place. “In terms of addressing major environmental problems in Boracay, we are optimistic and confident that these issues were already resolved by the inter-agency,” he said. He said visitors of Boracay will be allowed to swim only at the front beach and Puca beach. “In Bulabog, there are still problems there, the water quality. That’s why we will not allow tourists there,” Leones said. Meanwhile, Leones reminded tourists to book first with the compliant hotels before buying their plane tickets. He said the Department of Tourism has released a list of 115 hotels that complied with the requirements set by the inter-agency task force. Department of Transportation Assistant Secretary Mark de Leon said the island now has new transport system, which addresses complaints such as tricycles charging PHP100 to PHP150 pesos per trip. “We will be using an app where all the passengers will be able to pay their rides through wristband or tap card system,” de Leon said. “You don’t need to bring in your cash or you don’t need to haggle your fare with the drivers, just tap the card or the wristband. And it will solve a lot of problems, it will solve congestions,” he added. De Leon said the tap card or wristband can be used to ride around 500 e-trikes and 50 jeepneys that will operate on the island. He said ridesharing firm Grab, in coordination with a local cooperative, agreed to give free rides up to December. Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority Assistant Chief Operation Officer Nestor Domalanta said the expansion of the drainage system will be finished by the end of 2019. After the Boracay Island rehabilitation, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Assistant Secretary Jonathan Malaya said the government will also look into environmental law violations in other beach destinations of the country. “There have been a lot of reports already that other parts of the country, in particular beach destinations, are also having problems with compliance with local laws and environmental laws,” he said. Malaya particularly mentioned the famous El Nido in Palawan.

Drivers will regularly receive reports on their driving patterns such as speeding, acceleration and braking. These will enable drivers to understand how they drive and where they can improve. The Share My Ride and Emergency SOS features will enable drivers to share their live location with their loved ones. Driver and passenger authentification as well as stringent background checks which include criminal records and inspections on dormant driver accounts will be conducted for transparency purposes. Grab will also be enhancing its in-app data privacy center enabling passengers to have more control over personal information for their safety and protection. The firm will also be coordinating with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to prevent the delivery of packages containing illegal drugs, identify and report timely intelligence information for anti-drug operations and ensure a drug-free workplace in transportation network companies. PDEA will be leading in the investigation, arrest and filing of drug cases and will be conducting seminars and trainings on drug prevention with the cooperation of LTFRB and Grab.

It has likewise ordered all TNVS units included in the master list provided by transportation network companies to submit their applications and to secure the necessary provisional authority on or before August 31. The Board has noted that there were fewer applications for new CPCs for TNVS despite its order for the resumption of their acceptance last March. It has prioritized applicants that were included in the master list submitted by Uber and Grab, which was the subject of an audit review during that time. To date, the LTFRB has issued 13,816 units with provisional authority and 4,925 were issued with CPC. The LTFRB has issued a memorandum last February setting the supply cap of TNVS units in Metro Manila at 65,000. Of the proposed 65,000 vehicle cap, 55,000 slots have been allocated to vehicles based the master list of the LTFRB. Only 42,000 vehicles were left operating with Grab when Uber halted its operations in the country last March as not all vehicles were able to transfer from Uber. There are about 13,000 inactive vehicles on its system.

The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) continues on its dry-run of the traffic scheme. The scheme allows vehicles with two or more occupants with driver to traverse in Edsa from North Avenue in Quezon City to Magallanes in Makati City on both northbound and southbound directions from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. during weekdays. MMDA general manager Jojo Garcia said the agency respects the view of the senators, who cited that it was crafted without consultation with various sectors and this might lead to heavy vehicular volume on alternate routes. “We respect the resolution. What we are trying to do is to convene the Metro Manila Council hopefully soon,” Garcia said in a TV interview Thursday. The MMC is the policy-making body of MMDA, consisting of the mayors of the 16 cities and a municipality in Metro Manila. Senate Resolution No. 845 urges the MMC and the MMDA to suspend the HOV scheme and look for long-term solutions to ease traffic in Metro Manila. The resolution pointed out that the driver-only ban would effectively deprive thousands of people of the use of the country’s major thoroughfare since it would be in effect during the working and commuting hours of the week. Garcia said traffic has eased in Edsa during the first day of the dry-run Wednesday. “Lumuwag ang Edsa. Napunta yung traffic sa mga alternate routes (Traffic eased on Edsa and was diverted to alternate routes),” he added. He reiterated that the scheme aims to encourage carpooling among motorists and is one of the short-term measures being implemented by the MMDA to improve the traffic situation in the metropolis. “HOV is not a band aid solution; it’s a short term measure while infrastructure projects are being constructed for the long term,” Garcia said. Data from the MMDA show that a total of 2,905 vehicles were monitored to have violated the HOV scheme through closed circuit television cameras under the no contact apprehension policy and handheld cameras of its enforcers on the ground Thursday morning. A total of 3,628 violators were flagged down during the first day of the dry-run on Wednesday. The MMDA is eyeing to purchase thermal cameras to effectively catch violators of the expanded HOV traffic scheme. Ridesharing firm Grab Philippines, meanwhile, urged its passengers to avoid setting pickup and dropoff points along Edsa. The company encourages its drivers to use the yellow lane and take the nearest exit away from Edsa if it is unavoidable to pass by without a passenger. “We ask our drivers and passengers to be patient as we work with the regulators to set an acceptable scheme that carefully considers sentiment and suggestions of our TNVS market,” Grab public affairs head Leo Gonzales said in a statement. Around 60-70 percent of vehicles that pass along Edsa have only single occupants, according to data from the MMDA. There are 367,738 vehicles traversing the major artery daily, 67 percent of which are private vehicles based on Edsa's annual average daily traffic in 2017.

The MMDA's policymaking body, the Metro Manila Council (MMC) that consists of mayors in the National Capital Region, approved the traffic scheme during its regular meeting Tuesday. Under the policy, vehicles with two or more occupants, including the driver, would be able to pass through Edsa using the special lane. “Sa usapin po ng guidelines, implementing rules and regulations at penalties, ano 'yung rush hours mga oras na kung kailan bawal, paano ma-monitor ang mga heavily tinted vehicles, wala pa po kaming maisasagot dahil tinatapos po namin 'yung guidelines na mag-fit po sa lahat ng sektor (On the matter of guidelines, implementing rules and regulations as well as penalties, what are the rush hours and what time vehicles are not allowed, how to monitor heavily tinted vehicles, we cannot yet answer that at the moment as we are still crafting guidelines that would fit all sectors),” MMDA Spokesperson Celine Pialago said in a television interview Wednesday. The MMDA hopes the HOVL would encourage carpooling among motorists to further ease the traffic situation in Metro Manila. “'Yung mga guidelines kailangan pa pag-meetingan at i-submit for consultation. Hintayin ninyo po muna ang guidelines. Magkakaroon pa po ng dry run at publication within 15 days before implementation (The guidelines are yet to be deliberated and submitted for consultation. Let us wait for them. A dry run will be conducted and these guidelines will be published within 15 days before implementation),” Pialago added. Ridesharing firm Grab Philippines said it will be initiating dialogues with the government to seek clarification on the policy. “We will initiate dialogues with the authorities and our regulators as we seek clarity on this new scheme. We will include your TNVS leaders in the discussions to make sure that your concerns will be well represented,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement. Other countries like Indonesia have the same policy and Grab has found a way to make it work, Cu said. He assured Grab's drivers and operators that they “will do (their) best to also make it work here.” The MMDA had proposed the HOVL last year to reduce vehicular volume along Edsa. Vehicles with at least two or more passengers were allowed to pass through Edsa using the fifth and leftmost lanes. A dry-run was conducted in December last year to test the feasibility of the scheme but the MMDA later decided to cancel its implementation as its traffic enforcers were having difficulty inspecting heavily-tinted vehicles.

The DOTr has issued DO 2018-013 last June authorizing the LTFRB to determine the fare, rates and other charges of TNCs after undergoing public hearings and consultations to ensure that they are just and reasonable. DO 2017-11 which was issued by the department on June 19, 2017 allows TNCs to have a pre-arranged fare as authorized by the LTFRB. “Any issuance by this Honorable Board which would ultimately determine the fare that may be charged by TNCs and TNVS should only be applied prospectively and should not prejudice respondent for relying on a valid and subsisting DO 2015-011,” according to Grab. The company further said that it has informed the Board of its fare structure which includes the per-minute charge. “Respondent MyTaxi.PH respectfully prays that this Honorable Board reverse and set aside its order dated July 9, and in lieu of, issue a new one dismissing the show-cause order and case for utter lack of merit,\" the firm further said.

The order authorizes the LTFRB to determine the fare structure of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS). “Facts would show that the basis of the respondent in prescribing the per-minute charge was Department Order No. 2015-011.

The Board order fines Grab PHP10 million for overcharging and to reimburse the per-minute charge through future ride bookings of its passengers. “Thus, in the imposition of any administrative sanction, the Board must only do the same after the effectivity of Department Order No. 2017-011. Said issuance should be applied prospectively and not retroactively. However, if after thorough evaluation and investigation, respondent will still impose the per-minute charge after the effectivity of the said Department Order, then and only then can the Board impose the appropriate penalty.

This as Grab said that the earnings of its drivers have declined since the per-minute charge was suspended last April. Grab is expected to spend more than PHP100 million a month for the fare subsidy as it ensures to provide proper income to drivers of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) for them to earn a decent living while assuring that trips are still affordable to passengers. “Based on our computations, a TNVS driver needs to make at least PHP330 per hour to be able to properly provide for his family’s needs and to cope with the traffic, high fuel and vehicle maintenance costs,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Tuesday. “Since PHP2-per-minute component was suspended, we received a lot of painful complaints from our partners that their earnings are not sufficient anymore to make a decent living. That’s why we decided to step in,” he added. Ideally, TNVS drivers should be earning at least PHP5.50 per minute or PHP330 per hour, according to the ride-hailing firm. The fare subsidy will be based on the duration of riding hours of passengers and will ensure that drivers will get the ideal fare rate as computed by Grab’s system. “For example, if a ride from Makati to BGC (Bonifacio Global City) takes an hour because of heavy traffic despite short distance and fare is computed at PHP120 only. Grab will return to the driver the PHP210 difference to make sure he made PHP330 for that one hour trip. The subsidy will run as long as it’s needed and for as long as we have resources to do so,” Cu said. Grab is making an average of 600,000 bookings that increases up to 800,000 during peak hours while TNVS supply in its platform remains at 33,000. The firm has earlier said that it is seeking for the migration of about 6,000 drivers to its platform, who were displaced following the halt of Uber’s operations last April. The operating cost of Grab Philippines has increased to PHP4.57 billion last year from PHP2.45 billion in 2016 while its net losses amounted to PHP2.92 billion in 2017 compared to PHP1.56 billion in 2016.

In its petition filed before the Board dated May 18, Grab said the suspension by the Board of the per minute fare has infringed the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution as it has allowed other transportation network companies (TNCs) to impose similar charges prejudicing their operations. “The Honorable Board’s assailed Order dated 19 April 2018 suspending the petitioner’s imposition of its per minute charge as a component of its fare structure violates petitioner’s right to equal protection of the law since while the Honorable Board suspended such fee imposition by the petitioner, it has allowed other transportation network companies to include the same per minute charge in their respective fare structures,” Grab's petition read. The LTFRB has approved the accreditations of ride-hailing firms Hype Transport Systems Inc., Hirna Mobility Solutions Inc., Go Lag, Owto and MiCab Systems Corporation following the halt of the operations of Uber as a result of its acquisition by Grab last month. According to Grab, the Board has approved the fare structures of these new TNCs allowing them to impose per minute charges to their riders. The suspension will enable drivers and operators belonging to the common supply base which was imposed by the LTFRB to transfer to other TNCs as they are allowed to impose per minute charges, the firm said. “It is clear that members of the Honorable Board who issued the order suspending the per minute charge of the petitioner have caused undue injury and prejudice to the petitioner,” its petition read. The firm also said that the filing of a motion for reconsideration will render the LTFRB’s suspension order not executory. \"Since the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration by the petitioner on April 20, 2018 has the effect of staying the April 19, 2018 order, petitioner then has the legal authority to resume the imposition of the P2-per-minute charge pending the resolution of the motion,\" Grab said. The firm has said that it has the authority to formulate their own fare structures in accordance with the Department Order 2015-11 of the then Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC).

Grab is imposing a maximum cancellation of one trip per day as part of incentives for its drivers. Currently, its drivers cancel 8 percent of their trips while passengers cancel 12 percent of their rides. The ridesharing company seeks to reduce the rate of driver cancellation by 4 percent, and passenger cancellation by 6 percent under its 100-day plan to improve driver behavior and welfare, provide better ride experience, and upgrade customer support. Under the initiative, Grab will enhance the performance incentives it offers to drivers to motivate them to provide quality services to its riders. Top performing drivers will be rewarded based on their number of rides, high rating, and good feedback from passengers. Grab is also considering to implement a breakdown on its fares to ensure transparency of its operations. “We are working already a breakdown of the fare on the receipt. I have a team that is working on revising the receipt that you get. On the new receipt, you should be able to see the surge rate and the base fare, how many kilometers traveled. That is already a work in progress,” Toh said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launch of the campaign. “We just have tech constraints. We will be rolling it out. Our target is this will also be implemented within the 100 days,” she said. Grab implemented the masking of passenger destinations last April 27, which was initially rolled out to 25 percent of Grab drivers with historically low acceptance rate. It has also activated an auto-accept feature that will automatically allocate trips to drivers allowing a more seamless experience in continuously accepting passenger requests. Grab has maintained that the main reason for the difficulty in booking a ride is the lack of cars, resulting in low supply. The company is appealing to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to increase the supply cap of 65,000 transportation network vehicle service units in Metro Manila. Grab said that it receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests per day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve its riders. The suspension of the PHP2-per-minute travel charge by the LTFRB has caused a shortage in the supply of vehicles, leading to longer waiting time or non-allocation of rides according to the firm.

After the acquisition, we saw a massive increase in demand, a reduction in supply so that resulted to quite a lot of frustration actually for our riding public that means longer waiting time, inability to book a car,\" Grab country marketing head Cindy Toh said in a press conference Tuesday in Makati City. \"All complaints we've seen on social media. We've seen people posting about driver cancellations, their rude behavior, all of this we see and we know that it's been a very difficult time for the people that we are serving,\" she added. To improve driver behavior, Grab will implement an improved Driver Code of Conduct (COC), a set of updated rules and regulations that will stipulate the tasks and traits of a responsible Grab driver-partner. Drivers must comply with the COC for them to continue access to the Grab app. A Driver Academy will also be established that will provide modules on road courtesy, customer service and data privacy and social media handling on top of driver onboarding and rehabilitation training services. Grab drivers will also be qualified for perks such as discounted gas prices, driver lounge and maintenance discounts under the company’s rewards program. Passenger will be able to expect a new app interface for iOS and Android by July. The new app will enable them to easily set their pick-up points and quickly select their preferred service. Rewards will also be categorized for easier selection and redemption of offers. Grab is urging its riders to utilize the Help Center to report their concerns as well as their location issues particularly pick-up and drop off points. The ride-hailing firm will also partner with a BPO company to upgrade its customer service team which will be operational by July. Dedicated service lines for passengers, drivers and platinum users will allow easier access to after-ride services. “We hope that with these new improvements, our driver-partners will continue to be good and responsible members of the TNVS (transportation network vehicle services) community and enablers of better journeys,” Toh said. “Our aim is to be our passengers’ partner for better trips at all times.

Grab said the suspension of the PHP2-per-minute travel charge by the LTFRB has caused a shortage in the supply of vehicles leading to longer waiting time or non-allocation of rides. “Driver numbers continue to drop as uncertainty in maintaining sustainable livelihood increases. With the recent suspension of PHP2-per-minute fare, a lot of drivers and operators fear they won’t be able to provide for their families and car maintenance expenses,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Wednesday. The company said that it receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests per day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve its riders. Grab has 24,000 vehicles serving 60 percent to 65 percent of bookings while Uber had 19,000 vehicles and a success rate of 50 percent before the acquisition of its operations. Of the 19,000 active Uber vehicles, only 11,000 have moved to Grab. Majority of the gap is due to the 6,000 active Uber drivers who could no longer continue driving as they were not part of LTFRB’s audited master list. As a result, only 53 percent of passengers are able to get a ride on their first booking attempt, but this goes down to as low as 37 percent on average during peak hours. To address the gap in the supply of TNVS units across the country, Cu said they will need the collaboration of transport regulators and ride-hailing companies. \"With an average of 12 rides a day, this is already an additional 72,000 rides, which can help ease the plight of the riders,” Cu said. In the meantime, Grab is advising its riders to utilize the GrabShare feature on its app to maximize the use of its available vehicles through sharing rides with other passengers. It will also review its incentives structure to enable its drivers to efficiently deliver services to the passengers. For its part, the LTFRB said it is open to a possible review of the supply cap it has imposed on TNVS units as it has approved accreditations for new transportation network companies (TNCs). “We need to see the churning rates of TNCs -- how many operators were blacklisted and how many drivers are no longer operating. These are the things that are unique to the TNCs. If we will subtract something from the pool, we will replenish,” LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said in a text message to reporters. “We need to stress that this is a new denomination, everyone is working on the fly. It is still too early to set rigid rules on a technology that is still being tested first by its newness vis-a-vis the owners, drivers, passengers, and competition,” she added.

Calalang said that Grab transport network vehicle services (TNVS) units were issued certificates of public convenience (CPC) and provisional authority (PA) by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which means that the TNVS are performing a public service. \"If a TNVS driver cancels at least 24 accepted bookings in a day, that is an average of one cancellation per hour and that I believe is enough information and reason to conclude that driver is reneging on its commitment to perform the public service authority it got from LTFRB,\" he said.

Grab said its driver cancellation rate doubled to 11 percent last Friday. This was primarily caused by lower fares, resulting in the firm being able to service only half of the passenger demand. “Drivers have to buy gas, pay the monthly amortization for the vehicle or the daily boundary, and when traffic stalls them, it is only the PHP2 per minute that saves their income. So with the PHP2 gone, many of our drivers earn less and drive less, if at all. No matter how willing they are to drive, they are left with no choice but to think of ways to recover their expenses. Sadly, most of them have resorted to cancelling booking especially when they know they will traverse traffic,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Monday. Cu said 80 percent of the travel duration charge goes to the driver directly, while 20 percent is spent on driver incentives and rider promos. Last Friday, Grab filed a motion for reconsideration before the LTFRB, explaining that the PHP2 per minute travel charge is legal and in accordance with a 2015 order of the Department of Transportation that allows transportation network companies to set their own fare rates. Drivers will not earn a sustainable income and would be forced to quit their jobs as transport network vehicle services operators if the PHP2-per-minute charge is stopped, resulting in fewer vehicles for passengers, according to Grab. The firm had presented its fare structure including the PHP2-per-minute charge, in a technical working group meeting with the LTFRB in July 2017, after imposing the charge the previous month. Cu hopes that the LTFRB reinstates the travel time fare as this will benefit both drivers and passengers. “Let’s face it: kapag lugi ang driver, hindi lalabas yan. Walang masasakyan ang tao (Let's face it : if the driver is not earning, he will not drive. Commuters would have no rides),” he said.

The company also denied allegations that it is imposing illegal charges and that ridesharing companies have the right to set their rates in accordance with an order released by the then Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) in 2015. “We are not charging any illegal fares,” Grab legal counsel Miguel Aguila told a press conference in Quezon City. Department Order 2015-11 states that transportation network companies (TNCs) can set their own rates subject to oversight of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in cases of shortage of electric power or other sources of energy; strikes; civil disorders or other cause of an abnormal disruption of the market which results in the declaration of a state of emergency by the President. Aguila said Grab decided to impose the PHP2 per minute charge to ensure sustainable income for its drivers. Eighty percent of the charge goes directly to the drivers as part of their earnings while 20 percent is remitted to Grab which is reinvested as driver incentives and passenger promos. “What is important is for drivers to have sustainable livelihood in order to provide services to commuters,” Aguila said. Grab has also lowered its surge price cap from 2x to 1.5x in compliance with the order of the LTFRB.

There were no comms to the riders,” Cu said. There is no fare breakdown provided to riders as what they are shown upon booking is the \"upfront price\" or the total fare they pay at the end of the trip which includes the computation for the travel duration charge. \"The point that we like to make here is that the price for Grab is not the pre-agreed per kilometer or per minute but at the end of the trip, the sum of all those factors are charged and it's fixed,\" Cu said.

The PCC has imposed interim measures to ensure the credibility of its review on Grab's acquisition of Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia. The Commission reiterated that it will continue with its moto propio review despite the shutdown of Uber’s operations in the country. “As the antitrust authority, our lens is always focused on the market—in this case, we are reviewing the potential effects on competition in the merger between Grab and Uber in the ride-hailing platform,” the PCC said in a statement Monday. The mobile app of Uber was deactivated Monday after it has earlier announced that it will operate in the Philippines until April 15. The ridesharing company said that it no longer has the funds and manpower to continue its operations. Grab has acquired Uber’s ridesharing and food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia integrating them into its transportation and financial technology (fintech) platform last March 26. In return, Uber will receive a 27.5 percent stake in Grab’s shares. “Grab’s buyout of Uber will mean gobbling up 93% of the ride-hailing market. The accreditation of new TNCs (transportation network companies) is a welcome development to allow passengers to have more choices. We note, however, that the incoming TNCs are left with only 7% share in the market,” according to the PCC. “Established firms have the advantage of an existing user base due to 'network effects.' This means that when you buy a firm, in effect, you also get its customer base. This is an advantage that a newcomer does not have. PCC’s review will take into consideration these factors to level the playing field in this market,” the commission said.

Grab had earlier filed its petition, asking that their fares be increased, in addition to the base rate of PHP40, from a rate of PHP10-PHP14 per kilometer to PHP11-PHP15 per kilometer and its time charge increasing to PHP2.10 from the current PHP2 per minute rate. On the other hand, Uber is seeking for an increase of its fare from PHP5 per kilometer to PHP12 per kilometer. The LTFRB has recently increased the common supply base of TNVS units to 66,750 nationwide. The LTFRB based this on various factors, such as unserved demand, number coding scheme, and churning rate or the number of inactive drivers for the past few months. The supply base figure will be reviewed every three months.

The initiative was derived out of the current practice of TNVS drivers who are accredited by more than one transportation network company (TNC). “The policy on a common supply base for TNVS was envisioned to create a distinct denomination for this type of public transport service and not defined by the individual business models of the TNCs, thus giving the Board a more focused regulatory function on such service,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said in a statement over the weekend. “As it is now, the current TNCs and several other TNCs who have expressed interest to the Board to provide this type of service are now free to get the supply from the common supply base for their respective network unbridled by any preference over any TNC,” he added. The LTFRB, in a memorandum issued late last week, imposed a common base of 45,700 TNVS units nationwide which were broken down as follows: Metro Manila - 45,000 TNVS units Metro Cebu - 500 TNVS units Pampanga - 200 TNVS units The cap on TNVS units was determined from relevant data given by the leading TNCs, taking into consideration churning rate, percentage of full-time and part-time TNVS, peak and off-peak hours and average daily bookings, among others. The Board will review the policy three months after it becomes effective as demand varies from time to time. The common base will enable TNVS drivers to register under ridesharing companies that are accredited by the Board.  All valid and existing certificates of public convenience (CPCs) to operate TNVS and those with pending applications are included in the common supply base.

For its part, Grab said LTFRB’s move would adversely affect the number of TNVS units that they are operating amid increasing demand from their passengers. The ridesharing firm needs around 70,000-80,000 units in order to replenish their supply of transport services to the commuters. “What this supply cap does is take away the power of the part-timer who adds supply during critical supply. 45k DAILY ACTIVE DRIVERS in Manila make sense, but we need around 70k-80k total franchise holders since not all of them will be driving every day, despite any minimum active hours required,” Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said in a social media post.

The company is projecting that there was a 30-percent increase in demand since October this year, while the supply of its transport network vehicle services (TNVS) remain the same, according to Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu. “The extra load of 30-percent growth in demand will be very hard to serve. What we are doing now is trying to improve our allocation methodologies and algorithms -- the way the supply is set, providing incentives to our drivers to get them to drive a bit longer and to expand their opportunities for this holiday season,” Cu said in a press conference at Grab’s main office in Makati City Friday. “The only thing we can do is to stretch our supply because we cannot add more supply,” he added. Grab is not accepting new TNVS applications in compliance with the directive of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) last July for transportation network companies (TNCs) not to accept and activate new drivers into their systems, pending review of regulations governing the ridesharing industry. Cu stressed that the TNCs should not be the ones to be blamed for the traffic jams being experienced in Metro Manila. “Well, put it this way. We stopped adding cars in August. Has traffic got better or worse? Traffic has worsened. It’s not the TNCs or TNVS that are causing traffic,” Cu pointed out. He said an average Grab ride is now taking around 45 minutes, up from 38 minutes six months ago. Grab is advising passengers to adjust their travel schedules because of the expected heavy influx of vehicles for the Christmas season. Riders may avail of the app’s carpooling feature Grab Share, wherein they can share rides with passengers traveling in the same direction and split on the payment of the fares. “Grab Share is one of the features that we have to stretch supply because it allows passengers to share their rides. It will help stretch the existing supply base that we have,” Cu explained. Grab currently has around 54,000 accredited TNVS nationwide. Of this number, 20,000 are full-time drivers. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said TNCs are not being blamed but these are among the contributing factors to the heavy traffic in Metro Manila. “On the matter of Metro Manila traffic, we are not blaming them because there are other causes as well. However, they are contributing to the heavy vehicular volume, which is the top cause of the current traffic situation in Metro Manila,” MMDA spokesperson Celine Pialago said in a phone interview with the Philippine News Agency (PNA). The MMDA expects an increase of 50,000 in vehicular volume, based on data gathered from car dealers. Other causes of the traffic in the metropolis are the malls and bus terminals located along EDSA. Around 4,022 stalled vehicles along the major thoroughfare were likewise recorded by the MMDA from January to August this year.

Only through cooperation with government can we achieve a truly safer solution to the Filipino people,” Angkas said. “We humbly seek an audience to share more about Angkas, to understand more of LTFRB’s plans for modernization and regulation, and to discuss with how a willing company such as ours can hopefully continue to contribute to the betterment and modernization of transportation, not only in Metro Manila but in other cities in the country as well,” it added. Angkas urged the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to consider amending Department Order 2015-011 to allow two-wheeled vehicles under the transport network vehicle services (TNVS) category. The department order lumps group sedans, Asian utility vehicles, sports utility vehicles, vans, or other similar vehicles in the TNVS category. Last November 9, the Makati City local government has closed down the operations of Angkas’ office in the city after it has been found to be operating without a business permit following its joint inspection with the LTFRB. The LTFRB likewise apprehended 19 Angkas motorcycle riders in a joint anti-colorum operations with the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the PNP Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG).

The ridesharing firm stated that they have reported to the authorities at least six confirmed carnapping cases involving Grab Car. “Grab is working closely with the Philippine National Police - Highway Patrol Group, under which is Task Force Limbas, in resolving these cases.” Grab is currently developing a digital solution that would help decrease the chances of carnapping incidents involving TNVS. The TNC encourages its partner-drivers to be vigilant and to use 911 hotline for emergency cases. In October last year, Maquidato was one of the driver awardees who was recognized for giving a courtesy ride to a sick passenger after his good deed went viral because of a Facebook post from the passenger’s family. Divine Lactao Ornum booked a GrabCar for her sister, Prima, who was on her way to Quezon City to pick up bags of blood for her dialysis. Maquidato was in the area and was less than a minute away.

For taxis operating in CAR, the flagdown will be at PHP35 with the same rates for distance traveled and travel time. The Board explained that the increase was granted due to the recent spate of oil price hikes, as well as the emergence of transportation network companies (TNCs) that connect drivers and passengers through mobile applications. “It is urgent that the fare for taxis be increased for them to improve the quality of their service and become competitive amid increasing demand of passengers,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said in an interview with reporters Wednesday.

Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) spokesperson Aileen Lizada said Uber and Grab have agreed, during its technical working group meeting Wednesday afternoon, to comply with its memorandum circular providing for an enhanced personal accident insurance program. “We directed TNCs to provide insurance coverage the same as LTFRB is providing extensive coverage and all risk policy. We asked both Uber and Grab to improve the coverage that their TNVS (transport network vehicle services) should be having,” Lizada said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency (PNA). The Board has partnered with the Passenger Accident Management and Insurance Agency Inc. (PAMI) and SCCI Management and Insurance Agency Corporation (SCCI) for its insurance coverage. Under LTFRB Memorandum Circular 2015-028, passengers of public utility vehicles are entitled to monetary benefits from PHP3,000 to PHP200,000 including accidental death and other injuries. Usually, only TNVS units with provisional authority (PA) and certificate of public convenience (CPC) have government-mandated PAMI coverage since these are recognized by the LTFRB to have legitimate operations. Grab’s insurance policy mandates that those without PA or CPC should be enrolled to an insurance premium while those with PAs/CPCs get the same on top of PAMI. As such, all TNVS drivers accredited by Grab are covered by insurance and passengers can settle claims against the ridesharing firm. The LTFRB earlier said Uber offers limited insurance coverage compared to its competitor that has no fault indemnity clause and all-risk coverage. A no-fault indemnity insurance clause assures that the insurance company will pay for damages incurred regardless of whose fault has caused the accident. An all-risk insurance policy provides broader coverage as it insures passengers for losses that might arise from any extreme conditions. LTFRB will issue stickers for the identification of TNVS units with PAs or CPCs, Lizada said. The TNCs also agreed that their partner TNVS drivers and operators will participate in the Drivers Academy for public utility vehicles (PUV) which was established by the LTFRB to ensure road safety and discipline. Some of the issues that were also discussed in the meeting were: penalties for erring drivers; accountability of the TNCs; fare discounts and determination; and fleet management.

Ejercito made this statement on the sidelines of the closed-door meeting between representatives of the LTFRB and Uber in the Senate led by Senator Grace Poe, chair of the Senate Committee on Public Services. The senator pointed out that although Uber was “in-demand” by passengers, it is not an excuse to defy government regulations. He said that penalties will still have to be meted out. “I know that they’re popular, that’s why we want them to be back on the streets as soon as possible. We just made it clear that we want the interest of the riding public as a priority,” he added. Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV, in a statement, said that instead of a suspension, the LTFRB should only implement a fine as it would not affect daily operations. “Halting operations of Uber will only hurt the drivers and the riding public. A monetary penalty will give us the same result without having to hassle our commuters,” he said.
