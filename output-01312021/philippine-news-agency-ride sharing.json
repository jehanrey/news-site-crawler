Swat Mobility Philippines’ ridership has reached around 1 million to date, which accounts for 25 percent of the technology-based ride-sharing company’s total ridership and is on top 3 after Singapore and Japan, after it started operations in May 2020.  “For this year, in terms of goal, we’re looking at four to five times (growth). Pretty much this is challenging (but) I think this is something achievable because currently, we have actually set-up a number of clients already,” Swat Mobility Philippines country business head Maria Theresa Busmente said in a virtual briefing on Thursday.  Busmente said the company has “secured long-term contracts now being set up as compared to our experience in the early parts where most of our operations are just on trial basis.”  “But now these are all long-term,” she said.  Busmente said they continue to look at large companies and enterprises that provide shuttle service to their employees.  “Pretty much there are also requests coming from insurance companies, even pharmas (pharmaceutical companies). Also, a number of hospitals are also trying to give us interest,” she added.  During the same briefing, Swat Mobility president Grace Ho said there are a lot of opportunities in the Philippines given its large manufacturing, services, and business process outsourcing (BPO) sectors, among others.  Ho said essential workers, such as those from the medical field, are among their initial clients, with the help of Toyota Mobility Foundation.  “Opportunity came during the crisis but at the same time, there was good product market-fit because we’re a technology-enabled mobility solution,” she said.  Asked for the amount of investment in the Philippines so far, Ho did not give exact figures but said they plan to triple it this year to “more than a quarter million (Singapore dollars).”  “While we are headquartered in Singapore, we are on a very aggressive expansion agency so we hope that (the) Philippines will continue to be ranked not just top three but maybe even top two of my business as we track the year,” she said.

Under the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010, a 20 percent discount applies to delivery orders subject to certain conditions such as providing their senior identification card number while on the phone and presenting their senior citizen ID card upon delivery. Last week, Deputy Speaker Bernadette Herrera called for a congressional inquiry on the failure of food delivery platforms to honor the 20 percent discount for senior citizens. Herrera cited a number of complaints from senior citizens who could not avail of the 20 percent discount using platforms such as Grab, Food Panda, among others.

In a statement on Thursday, Grab said it launched a Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing site in partnership with the National Task Force (NTF) for Covid-19 and the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA). Located at the Quezon City Memorial Circle, it said the testing site will provide free RT-PCR tests for Grab drivers and couriers beginning Thursday (July 30). It added that the testing site will be active for two months and is part of the company’s GrabProtect program. “This two-month initiative is additive to the recently rolled-out GrabProtect program - which further raises the bar of safety and hygiene across Grab's suite of essential services,” Grab said. Brian Cu, Grab president, said the program is part of the company’s commitment to place safety “at the core of everything we do at Grab.” “We believe that through our partnership with the National Taskforce on COVID, the BCDA, and our driver- and delivery-partners, we continue to ensure our communities' safety as we navigate our paths to the new normal,\" Cu said. Earlier, the GrabProtect program was launched in several Southeast Asian countries as part of the international ride-sharing company’s health and safety measures against Covid-19. In the Philippines, Grab drivers and delivery partners are required to follow six guidelines as part of the program such as the mandatory wearing of face masks, completion of a \"personal health declaration\", regular personal and vehicle sanitation, among others.

In an advisory, DILG Secretary Eduardo M. Año directed provincial governors, city and municipal mayors to coordinate with neighboring LGUs to connect bicycle lanes and establish a bicycle road network. “Because of limited mass transportation, most people will resort to biking as a means of going to and from work. LGUs, therefore, have to be ready with the bike lanes in their areas to ensure the safety of the cyclists,” he said. Año said local governments must also ensure that all bicycle lanes are free from any obstruction to prevent any untoward road accidents. “Siguraduhin po nating walang nakahambalang sa mga dadaanan ng bisikleta sa inyong lugar para iwas-disgrasya at para maging mabilis ang biyahe ng mga siklista (Make sure bike lanes have no any obstruction to prevent accident and it will not hamper the cyclists),” he said. He said bicycles as a mode of transportation is encouraged by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). “As per the Omnibus Guidelines on the Implementation of Community Quarantine issued by the IATF, the use of bicycles and other non-motorized forms of transportation is strongly encouraged,” he said. “In this new normal, we want to enjoin everyone to use bikes. Good for the health ang bike, at tsaka, matipid pa. Hindi mo na kailangang bumili ng gasoline (Bikes are good for the health, economical, and you don’t need to buy gasoline),” Año said. He said LGUs must also enact ordinances to impose reasonable penalties on violations in the use of the bike lanes to ensure that both motorists and cyclists follow the regulations along the said lanes. According to him, LGUs should follow the Department of Transportation (DOTr’s) design approach of putting up plastic bollards, stencil markings and signage in the designated bike lanes for the safety of the bicycling public especially in major thoroughfares where fast-moving buses and other huge vehicles are passing through the same road. He also reminded LGUs to strictly implement health and safety protocols including the mandatory wearing of face masks of the persons using said lanes and in all public areas. “SOP na dapat ang pagsusuot ng mask at physical distancing sa mga pampublikong lugar. Masanay na tayo sa ganitong sitwasyon habang wala pang gamot at vaccine laban sa Covid-19 (Wearing of mask and physical distancing in public places should be standard operating procedure. We will get used to it while waiting for vaccine against Covid-19),” he said. Motor taxis still prohibited Meanwhile, DILG Undersecretary and Spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said motor taxis hailed through motorcycle ride-sharing apps such as Angkas are still not allowed during GCQ and modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) under current IATF guidelines. “Alam po namin na marami pong umaasa sa Angkas at iba pang motor taxis para makarating sa kanilang trabaho at destinasyon ngunit dahil sa patuloy na banta ng Covid-19, hindi pa rin pinahihintulutan ng gobyerno ang ganitong mode of transportation dahil sa violation ng physical distancing,” said Malaya. The DILG, through Memorandum Circular 2020-083, directed all LGUs to strictly prohibit the operation of motor taxis as part of the regulatory measures in public transportation in areas under the MECQ and GCQ. Malaya also said motorcycle back ride is prohibited even for married couples as part of the physical distancing measures as this allows prolonged close contact between two people and will lead to possible transmission of Covid-19. “While we understand the request of many of our kababayan (countrymen), back ride is a clear violation of physical distancing and it will be impossible for the police and our traffic enforcers to check each and every motorcycle if these are married couples. If we grant one exemption, it will open the floodgates to violations by those who are not allowed. The health risks outweigh the benefits,” he said. Among the alternative modes of transportation suggested by the DOTr during the post-pandemic period are the use of bikes and modernized PUVs (public utility vehicles) as these have less contact with other people and lessens the risk of spreading the virus among passengers.

Retired Col. Eduardo Montealto Jr., regional director of LTFRB-7, said that Maxim, a ride-sharing app that originated from Shadrinsk, Russia is actively operating in Cebu despite absence of accreditation from their office. “On Feb. 7, a joint operation with LTFRB-7 and Highway Patrol Group-7 apprehended a transport network vehicle service (TNVS) using the so-called Maxim ride-hailing app. The units that we apprehended are a Kia Picanto and a Mitsubishi Strada pickup type truck,” Montealto said. Maxim has not sought accreditation with the LTFRB to operate legally as a ride-hailing app for booking of trips by customers via mobile phones or tablets, he said. Montealto admitted there are so many unaccredited TNVS operating in Cebu and using apps that are not registered with the agency. Last month, LTFRB-7 operatives apprehended six cars for illegally operating as TNVS using inDriver, another unaccredited ride-hailing app. Both inDriver and Maxim are not among the list of LTFRB-recognized apps such as Grab Car, MiCab, Hype and Hirna. InDriver was founded in 2012 but Maxim started as a modern taxi-ride ordering service in Russia in 2003 and simultaneously opened branches in seven cities worldwide in 2009. It expanded to 17 more cities in 2010. Montealto lamented that Filipino counterparts of Maxim and inDriver operators abroad could clandestinely operate in Cebu without fear being detected by authorities. According to initial investigation by the LTFRB-7, Maxim has revealed in its Facebook account the address of its office along J. De Veyra Street in North Reclamation Area here. Montealto, however, said operations personnel will continue to monitor their movements and conduct apprehensions against TNVS operators using Maxim and inDriver based on intelligence reports that they can gather. TNVS operating via unaccredited ride-hailing app are not paying taxes to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, he said. He said the two vehicles apprehended on Friday in a mall in Mandaue City were placed in the impounding area pending payment of penalty ranging from PHP120,000 to PHP200,000 for engaging in colorum operations, aside from being blacklisted for 90 days. LTFRB record showed Cebu has reached the cap of 1,500 TNVS while the request for additional units has not yet been approved by the board.

In a statement released Thursday, the LTFRB said the fine imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) was due to Grab’s failure to follow through with a voluntary commitment it made with the antitrust body. “To put it in proper context, the fine issued by PCC in its decision recently rendered pertains to the failure of Grab to fulfill its commitment to PCC as embodied in Grab's Undertaking which it voluntarily submitted to PCC. It has nothing to do with LTFRB's fare structure,\" LTFRB Board Member Ronaldo Corpus said in a meeting between the LTFRB and the PCC on Monday.

According to the LTFRB’s Memorandum Circular 2019-036 which contains the fare matrix imposed by the LTFRB on Transportation Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) such as Grab, TNVS companies shall charge a flag down rate of up to PHP40 for car sedans, up to PHP50 for premium Asian utility vehicles/sport utility vehicles (SUV), and up to PHP30 for hatchbacks/sub-compact vehicles.

Grab’s voluntary pricing commitments covered August 2018 to May 2019. PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said both fines for the first and second quarters of the first undertaking totaling to PHP18.4 million will be paid to the PCC, and remitted to the national treasury. However, the third-quarter fine of PHP5.05 million and ensuing quarterly fines will be refunded to Grab customers through GrabPay within 30 days of Grab’s receipt of a notice of breach from the PCC, he said. The refund order was made through an amendment to Grab’s first commitment with the PCC and will be effective throughout the rest of the company’s price-related commitments which are set to end on Nov. 1, 2020, he added. “In the third quarter, in the fourth quarter and the extended period, that will be subject to refund,” Bernabe said. The fines, he said, were imposed after Grab exceeded the allowable deviation from its prices before its buyout of rival Uber. The allowable deviation or increase in prices was set to 22 percent from levels before Grab’s virtual monopoly of the ride-sharing market, which meant Grab constantly exceeded its allowable price-hike since the buyout, and was fined based on how much it breached its agreement with the PCC. During the event, Balisacan also announced a new set of voluntary commitments by Grab which were broadly categorized into non-exclusivity, service quality, and price-related commitments. The non-exclusivity commitments, Balisacan said, have implications on new competitors to the ride-sharing market and will be effective for four years from Nov. 1, 2019. These include commitments to prevent exclusive membership or registration of drivers or operators to Grab, monitoring of incentives to drivers/operators, and provision of licensing and regulatory support. Grab’s service quality commitments, meanwhile, will be effective for one year from Nov. 1, 2019 and would help ensure that Grab drivers would not discriminate against passengers through the removal of the “see destination” feature for drivers with a completion rate below 65 percent for the first quarter and 70 percent for the remaining quarters. For price-related commitments, which would also be effective for one year, Balisacan further said these include a fare transparency commitment and a system-wide average fare cap to limit the average fare increase to 22.5 percent in most months. He added each violation will subject Grab to fines of up to PHP2 million per breach, not including a disgorgement mechanism wherein Grab will refund its commissions in excess of the system-wide average fare cap per month. “We hope that with the commitments set out in the extended undertaking, the riding public will be protected from the threat of monopolistic behavior,” Balisacan said.

In a statement, Grab highlighted the modernization efforts of Valenzuela City through its 3S Plus Online Services which include the Paspas Permit that would enable business permit applicants to receive their provisionary permits in seconds following confirmation of payment through an online portal. During the signing of a memorandum of agreement between the two parties on Tuesday, Mayor Rexlon “Rex” Gatchalian said the Paspas Permit project will officially launch on November 12, coinciding with the city's founding anniversary. Grab president Brian Cu said Valenzuela City’s embrace of technology and innovation makes it an “equitable and reliable partner to help build Metro Manila’s first smart city.” “Valenzuela is one of the LGUs (local government units) in the country that we deeply admire as they are embracing and adopting technology to provide their constituents efficient and meaningful public service,” Cu said. Once a provisionary permit is received by the applicant, Grab enters the transaction through their on-demand courier service Grab Express which would deliver the actual business plates right at the applicant’s doorsteps. “This is where Grab comes in. As we all know, Grab has made on-demand delivery of parcels faster, and this partnership is a great compliment to our 3S Plus Online Services,” Gatchalian said. The process effectively eliminates the need for a business permit applicant to visit and line up at the city hall, Grab said. Grab also announced the collaboration with the city government in building a “hyper-localized mapping system of Valenzuela City” which would enable accurate and efficient bookings of services offered by Grab in its mobile app. The ride-sharing company added that Grab and the city government will also share relevant data on the updated base map or satellite imagery of Valenzuela City in compliance with Philippine data privacy laws.

In a Twitter post, Gatchalian said aside from the bill, he has also filed a resolution to investigate the incident. The senator said Grab should provide the money for purchasing goods ordered by their customers instead of its delivery partners. Verifying the legitimacy of buyers was also needed, Gatchalian said, noting that even fast-food giant McDonald’s asks for legitimate landline numbers to validate orders. He added that cashless payments must be encouraged to help ease, if not eliminate, the risk in their GrabFood delivery service. On Saturday, GrabFood released a statement on the said incident and initial investigation showed that the delivery-partner did not incur personal losses or needed to pay with his cash as the order was paid in a cashless transaction. “The cashless payment capability is currently available in select merchants and is being tested as a solution to limit the need for our delivery-partners to carry cash or working capital,” Grab said. Language differences and miscommunication between the delivery-partner and the customer were found to be the source of the failed transaction. “After waiting for more than 20 minutes at the drop-off point, the delivery-partner proceeded to treat the transaction as a no-show,” Grab said. However, Grab said their no-show and reimbursement policy was not followed by their delivery-partner which prescribed the drinks to be surrendered immediately to Grab. Afterwards, the customer tried to claim the drinks but was too late. The company added that they have reimbursed the customer and compensated the driver for his time and effort.

Every fare collected from the GrabBuklat service will be matched by the company and total proceeds will be used to purchase school supplies for chosen schools, the company said. Grab Philippines president Brian Cu said the initiative aims to help shape the minds of young Filipinos into becoming future leaders of the country. “Through this initiative, we aim to use our technology and community leadership in providing meaningful learning to young minds, and help them be more and do more in the service of the Filipino people,\" Cu said. On its website, Grab said storybooks and reference books for children ages six to 10 years old, young adult books for ages 10 to 16, and reference books for high school students are welcome for donation. It added that the service is only available within Grab’s servicing areas and the maximum total package weight is 20 kilograms. Arvi Persan Lopez, Grab public relations officer, enumerated the other social initiatives of the ride-sharing company. These include GrabIgib, which helped alleviate the recent water crisis in parts of Metro Manila; provision of relief goods and services following a fire in Cebu and an earthquake in Pampanga through GrabBayanihan; building of classrooms in partnership with HOPE; and the deployment of six teaching fellows in Marikina City in another initiative with Teach for the Philippines. He said Grab has also partnered with several government institutions such as the Commission on Elections to aid in voter education, the Highway Patrol Group of the Philippine National Police through the provision of a shooting simulator for its personnel, the Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor to provide livelihood to the urban poor, and the Commission on Filipinos Overseas to help fight human trafficking in the country.

Angeline Tham, Angkas chief executive officer (CEO), admitted a \"misstep\" on posting the tweet and apologized. “We are deeply sorry for this, and would like to reassure everyone that we are committed to the safety of our passengers, above all else,” Tham said. Before it was deleted, the tweet read, “Angkas is like sex. It’s scary the first time pero masarap na ulit-ulitin (but feels good to repeat over and over).”  The tweet went viral after the PNP’s reply saying Angkas is scaring its own users and does not promote safety in public transport. DOTr Assistant Secretary for Communications Goddes Hope Libiran in a message sent to reporters said she has approached Angkas for their tweet’s inappropriate content before it was deleted. “I approached them last night and told them that we think their post is inappropriate. They deleted the post already,” Libiran said. The ride-sharing CEO emphasized the safety of their service and clarified their playful tweet only meant they can be trusted once tried. “Angkas is a service you can trust once you’ve tried it. If nothing else, our 99.997 percent safety record is a testament to the quality of our service,” Tham said. She has also apologized to their bikers for casting them in an unfair light. “Our biker-partners have been trained to respect their riders and make them as comfortable as possible. And no tweet can change that fact,” Tham said. Tham added that while they believe sex should be discussed maturely and openly, it must be treated more desirably. “Sex should never be used to create shame, fear, or disgust, and certainly not used lightly for the sake of some buzz,” Tham said.

The DOTr respects the legislative process this bill will undergo, as government policies are anchored on the power of the law,” the DOTr statement said. While RA 4136 prohibits motorcycles from operating as public transport services, various stakeholders in the transportation sector are pushing for the amendment of the law to enable motorcycles to provide public transport to commuters. Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade ordered last December the creation of a technical working group (TWG) to review the issue of making motorcycles as a mode of public transport. The TWG will conduct deliberations on various issues covering the capability of motorcycles and drivers for public transport service, which include determining the types of motorcycle that can be awarded a franchise, the minimum cubic centimeter (CC) capacity, travel speed, franchise routes, seat and helmet requirements, and training requirements for motorcycle bikers looking to register as a public utility vehicle driver. Among other concerns are: whether the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) or local government units will issue the franchises for motorcycles; whether motorcycles may traverse municipal borders; registration of e-bikes or e-motorcycles as motorcycle taxis and safety issues particularly responsibilities and accountabilities in cases of accidents. “It is easy to say that motorcycle taxis are convenient and speedy as they can weave through traffic. However, when accidents involving passengers pile up and no accountabilities are made for the victims’ funeral and hospitalization expenses, should the motorcycle driver or owner be allowed to simply walk away without any measure of responsibility? For the DOTr, passenger safety and security are paramount,” the DOTr’s statement read. “We will listen to all parties, and determine if legalizing motorcycle taxis is what’s best for the riding public,” it added. The TWG, consisting of the DOTr, LTFRB, Land Transportation Office, Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group, Metro Manila Development Authority, and representatives from the Senate, House of Representatives, commuter welfare groups, road safety advocates, motorcycle manufacturers, motorcycle organizations and law schools, will start deliberations on Friday. The TWG will submit a report on its deliberations to Congress as inputs for lawmakers to decide on the proposed amendments to the Land Transportation Code. The House Committee on Metro Manila Development, on the other hand, urged the DOTr to come up with a department order to regulate motorcycle ride-sharing services like Angkas, while waiting for the amendment of the law defining vehicles suitable for public transport. Lawmakers said there is a need for motorcycle taxis such as Angkas to operate as public transport services amid growing passenger demand. The Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order last December 5 against the decision of the Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court to interfere with Angkas’ operations. It prevented the implementation of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by Judge Carlos Valenzuela of Mandaluyong RTC Branch 213 last August in favor of Angkas, which prohibited the DOTr and LTFRB from apprehending Angkas bikers. Tugade directed the LTFRB to apprehend Angkas bikers, who deliberately defy the order of the high court.

The anti-trust watchdog said the non-compliance of both companies has prejudiced its review process and impeded their ability to impose remedies for the benefit of the riding public. “This would include an order for them to revert to their pre-merger condition. We asked Uber to come back to the market and operate independently of Grab,” PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo said in a press briefing held in Makati City on Wednesday. “Given the challenges, it was really just more difficult to complete the review process. We required more information, we required more analysis, we required more meetings with the parties which would not have occurred if they were able to return to the pre-merger conditions,” she added. The fines imposed against Uber and Grab are broken down as follows: PHP8 million against Grab for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review; PHP4 million against Uber for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review; and PHP4 million for proceeding with the execution of their agreements during the review period In its resolution issued last Oct. 11, the PCC said Uber and Grab violated two of its seven interim measures it has imposed last April. These are maintaining independent business operations and other conditions (platforms, pricing and payment policies, incentives, promotions, database, onboarding of drivers, etc.) prior to the merger on March 25 and refraining from executing any final agreement or contract that will transfer any asset, equity, interest, including the assumption by Uber of a board seat in Grab. Other measures include: refrain from providing access between parties any confidential information (i.e. pricing, formulas, incentives, operations, marketing and sales policies, promotions, customer and driver database); refrain from imposing exclusivity clauses, lock-in periods and/or termination fees to drivers; refrain from acts that may lead to reduced viability and saleability of businesses; refrain from acts that will prejudice the PCC’s power to review the transaction and impose remedies; and refrain from performing any act that may lead and/or further lead to the consummation of the transaction. The commission has approved the acquisition deal between Uber and Grab last August 10. This was made after Grab has submitted its voluntary commitments to the PCC which includes improving the quality of its service, particularly response time to rider complaints. Grab fares shall not have an “extraordinary deviation” from the minimum allowed fares, which are set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. The deviation should not be more than 22 percent of the fares before the acquisition of Uber, according to the PCC. The firm also assured that it will provide a breakdown on fares on electronic receipts to its riders. The receipts will include the distance, fare surges, discounts, promo reduction, and per-minute waiting charge. Grab will also remove the “see destination” feature for drivers with low ride acceptance rate. It will not introduce policies that will result in drivers and operators being exclusive to Grab, to allow them to register with other ridesharing companies through a multi-homing scheme. The PCC has appointed United Kingdom-based auditing firm Smith & Williamson to monitor the compliance of Grab with its voluntary commitments for one year.

The rebate will be availed of only for 20 days from the time the decision becomes final or when the respondent shall commence the implementation of the rebate whichever is earlier,” the LTFRB said in its order dated July 9 released to the media Tuesday. “The amount of the rebate shall be limited to the portion of the income of the respondent only, directly related to or arising from PHP2-per-minute during the period of its unauthorized imposition,” it added. The per-minute charge was imposed by Grab from June 2, 2017 until April 19, 2018 when it was suspended by the LTFRB. Grab previously said the per-minute charge is in accordance with Department Order 2015-11 of the then Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), which authorizes transportation network companies to set their own fares subject to the oversight of the LTFRB. “Respondent failed to impress the Board that its imposition of the per-minute travel rate is within the purview of its discretion or authority. On the contrary, it was clearly shown that such imposition of respondent TNC (transportation network company) is invalid and without authority from the Board, for which the respondent is to suffer its consequences,” according to the LTFRB. The Board has previously said there was no mention of any travel time rate, which Grab has been collecting, when it released its order on the fare structure of transportation network companies (TNCs) in Dec. 27, 2016.

The subsidy program, which the company rolled out last June 19, aims to ensure sustainable income for its drivers while meeting the demand for rides from its passengers. “We have provided around PHP70 million for over two weeks. Almost lahat affected (Almost everybody was affected) and they will be given subsidies,” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launch of its Smart City initiative in Makati City. “The reason why we shifted to subsidies from incentives is that we saw that a lot of drivers who are driving part-time do not hit incentives anyway. May mga trips na nalulugi sila (They have trips wherein they are losing money). The subsidies ensure that the assistance for driver income occurs on a more broad basis. Rather than a few getting a lot, there are now a lot getting enough,” he added. Grab earlier said the earnings of its drivers have declined since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board suspended the PHP2-per-minute travel charge last April. Ideally, TNVS drivers should be earning at least PHP5.50 per minute or PHP330 per hour, according to the ride-hailing firm. Grab is eyeing to spend more than PHP100 million a month for the fare subsidy, which will be based on the duration of riding hours of passengers and will ensure that drivers get the ideal fare rate as computed by its system. The ride-hailing firm is also seeking for the migration of about 6,000 drivers to its platform, who were displaced following the halt of the operations of its corporate rival, Uber. Grab makes some 600,000 bookings nationwide per day, which increase up to 800,000 during peak hours, while TNVS supply in its platform remains at 33,000. Meanwhile, the firm is eyeing to implement a multimodal transportation system, wherein its TNVS units will be integrated into other modes of public transportation. This will provide a variety of choices for transportation by commuters as they go to their destinations. “The idea for us here in the Philippines is to take away cars traveling along congested roads and move them into higher capacity vehicles, like shuttles and buses,” Cu said. The Grab official said the company is coordinating with transport regulators to provide a free hand in franchising shuttles and other modes of transportation. “We are now meeting with P2P bus operators to see how we can use them as mid-mile while we provide the first and last mile form of transportation, either by cars or trikes,” he said.

The enhanced incentive to drivers will also help Grab recoup the increase in its operating costs in the past few years. “We will be providing spot incentives. These incentives will be applied the moment a booking is made. We need to widen the radius in order that our vehicles will have larger areas to operate,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a press conference in Quezon City Tuesday. “Spot incentive will be applied for every kilometer exceeding 2 km. in booked trips. The extra 1 km. will be given as spot incentive,” Cu said. Grab will offer subsidies out of its revenues and will not affect the fare that will be paid by riders. “This will be placed as part of the entire incentives program. This is a new feature on the technology side. We want to ensure that drivers will not be operating on a loss. Our current profitability is not the question here. The question here is how we can improve our services,” Cu said. The operating costs of Grab Philippines has increased to PHP4.57 billion last year from PHP2.45 billion in 2016 while its net losses amounted to PHP2.92 billion in 2017 compared to PHP1.56 billion in 2016. The increase in Grab’s operating costs was attributed to revenues from the 20 percent commission from rides that are being used for driver incentives. “We do not expect the situation to change in the next 12 to 18 months. We are still in investment mode and are not expecting to make money anytime sooner. But these losses are still within our budget forecast,” Cu said.

The order remains in effect,” Delgra said. “There was no mention of travel time rate by Grab when the LTFRB came out with an order last December 2016 on the fare structure of TNCs,” he added. Grab legal counsel John Paul Nabua said that its PHP2 per minute travel charge was in accordance with the order of the then Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) in 2015, which allows ride-sharing companies to set their own fares with the oversight of the LTFRB. “Department Order 2015-11 allows TNCs to determine their rates. Grab started charging the travel duration rate as early as June 2017,” Nabua said. He admitted, however, that there was no mention of per minute rate in the December 2016 order of the LTFRB. Grab has presented its fare structure during a technical working group (TWG) meeting with the Board on July last year. The hearing was conducted after Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) Partylist Rep. Jericho Nograles accused Grab of illegally charging PHP2 per minute for their rides, on top of its flagdown rate of PHP 40 and charging PHP 10-14 per kilometer. The lawmaker said the ride-sharing firm has ‘unilaterally’ reprogrammed their algorithm to impose the additional charges. He said that the LTFRB should be the one that should determine the rates that will be set by the TNCs. “Presentation by Powerpoint does not constitute a fare petition. The presentation of fare structure is not a cause for approval. Would it mean that any instance, a PowerPoint presentation would make it legal already? That's not what due process is,” Nograles said. “What we are fighting for here is consumer rights and due process. It turned out that the implementation of the PHP2 per minute in June 2017 did not undergo due process and only underwent Powerpoint presentation,” he added. Grab should refund around PHP 1.8 billion of alleged illegal charges to its customers, Nograles said. Partner drivers and operators of Grab that were present in the hearing expressed their concern that the refund would result in the loss of their livelihood. The next hearing of the LTFRB on the issue is scheduled on May 29, 2018.

The PCC has imposed interim measures to ensure the credibility of its review on Grab's acquisition of Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia. The Commission reiterated that it will continue with its moto propio review despite the shutdown of Uber’s operations in the country. “As the antitrust authority, our lens is always focused on the market—in this case, we are reviewing the potential effects on competition in the merger between Grab and Uber in the ride-hailing platform,” the PCC said in a statement Monday. The mobile app of Uber was deactivated Monday after it has earlier announced that it will operate in the Philippines until April 15. The ridesharing company said that it no longer has the funds and manpower to continue its operations. Grab has acquired Uber’s ridesharing and food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia integrating them into its transportation and financial technology (fintech) platform last March 26. In return, Uber will receive a 27.5 percent stake in Grab’s shares. “Grab’s buyout of Uber will mean gobbling up 93% of the ride-hailing market. The accreditation of new TNCs (transportation network companies) is a welcome development to allow passengers to have more choices. We note, however, that the incoming TNCs are left with only 7% share in the market,” according to the PCC. “Established firms have the advantage of an existing user base due to 'network effects.' This means that when you buy a firm, in effect, you also get its customer base. This is an advantage that a newcomer does not have. PCC’s review will take into consideration these factors to level the playing field in this market,” the commission said. The PCC has formulated various interim measures that would ensure the credibility and integrity of its review on the merger of Uber and Grab for possible anti-competition concerns. Among these include maintaining the independence of their business operations; refraining from sharing confidential information, such as pricing and operations; and refraining from imposing exclusivity clauses. Both Uber and Grab were also asked to refrain from performing any practice that could lead to reduced viability of their businesses and prejudice the PCC’s power to review the transaction and impose remedies.

Pimentel made the statement following news of the imminent exit of ride-hailing platform pioneer Uber from the country next week. On March 26, Singapore-based Grab acquired Uber's Southeast Asia operations, covering ride-sharing services in the Philippines, as well as Uber's operations in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Uber's last day of operations in the Philippines will be on April 8. Pimentel said that given these developments, it was incumbent upon the LTFRB to work overtime to process pending TNVS applications and to ensure that Grab would not take advantage of its monopoly of the TNVS industry. “Many regular TNVS users regularly compared the rates of Uber and Grab before booking a ride -- an option that will no longer be available to commuters when Grab becomes the sole TNVS provider come April 9,” he noted. \"There is a legitimate fear among regular TNVS users that Grab's acquisition of Uber's operations in the country will lead to higher fares, which is the natural consequence when a player monopolizes a particular industry,\" he said. He said that it would be beneficial if any one of them starts operation, referring to the reported application of other local ride-sharing companies for accreditation to operate in the country. Last week, the LTFRB said that Go Lag, Owto, and Hype were in the process of completing their TNVS accreditations before the agency. \"The LTFRB announcement that there are three new ride-sharing companies that want to enter the country can only be considered good news if any or all of these companies actually get to service our countrymen,\" Pimentel said. \"We need real competition, not potential competition. As long as riders have zero options, they will be vulnerable to overpricing and poor service -- and this is where the LTFRB must come in,\" he added. He also called on the LTFRB to \"strike a balance between encouraging the entry of new players and the need for these players to comply with the country's TNVS guidelines.\" He urged the LTFRB to pay close attention to feedback from TNVS users and put in place mechanisms to immediately act on rider complaints. \"Social media has provided the LTFRB with the tools to monitor the prices and the performance of Grab after Uber exits.

In a statement, the PCC has urged the parties to undergo a voluntary review of the deal, if the transaction does not meet the requirements for mandatory notification. Under the new mandatory threshold, entities involved in mergers and acquisitions shall notify the PCC if the size of transaction breaches PHP2 billion and PHP5 billion for size of the party. The PCC has reminded the parties that if the deal is notifiable, Grab’s acquisition of Uber should not yet push through until the Commission has reviewed and approved the transaction. “If the transaction does not meet the threshold and is not notifiable, the parties are not so precluded but Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anti-competition concerns,” the Commission said, on the other hand. “Should anti-competitive concerns arise out of the transaction review, the parties may propose commitments to remedy, mitigate, or present the negative effects to competition in the market after the acquisition,” the PCC added. But if the parties refuse to undergo a voluntary review, the Commission cautioned that it can launch a motu proprio investigation on its own initiative regarding the transaction. The Commission said the review aims to determine if the Grab and Uber merger will substantially lessen the competition in the ride-sharing market in the Philippines. The PCC will evaluate and analyze if the acquisition will result in a fare increase, deterioration of service, lesser competition, and how it will fairly compete once new transport network companies enter the market. “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-sharing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said. “The Grab-Uber acquisition is likely to have a far reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services. As such, the PCC is looking at the deal closely with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns, as a notified transaction, or by opening a motu proprio case,” the Commission said. PCC officials met with representatives of Grab and Uber Monday to determine if their deal warrants closer scruitiny. “The consultation is taken as a sign of the parties’ willingness to comply with the provisions of the Philippine Competition Act, including ensuring real competition among ride-hailing options and promoting the welfare of the riding public,” said PCC. “PCC is committed to ensure that Grab’s acquisition of Uber in the Philippines will not harm the interest of the riding public,” it added.

The NPC wants to ensure that Grab will uphold the data privacy rights of its drivers and riders as it emerges as the leading transportation network company (TNC) in the Philippines. “We have called on Grab to a meeting next week to enlighten the Commission on this ‘sale’ particularly its provision on the processing of Filipino drivers’ and users’ data and the measures they take in protecting these data,” NPC Commissioner Raymund Liboro said in a statement late Tuesday. “As the biggest TNV (transport network vehicle) provider in the Philippines after the exit of Uber, we want Grab to demonstrate that they could 'walk the talk' when it comes to protecting personal data and upholding the data privacy rights of its drivers and users,” he added. Grab, through its legal counsel, lawyer John Paul Nabua, assured the NPC that it will cooperate and comply with the data privacy and protection laws in the country. “Grab also declared to the Commission that there will be no sharing of any user data between Uber and Grab. Uber users and drivers will be required to register anew with Grab to allow them to use the Grab TNV platform,” Liboro said. Grab announced Monday that it has taken over Uber’s ride-sharing and food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia integrating them into its transportation and financial technology platform. Uber will take 27.5 percent stake in Grab as part of the acquisition. Meanwhile, the NPC assured that the merger with Grab will not affect its investigation of the past data breaches of Uber involving Filipino users. “This investigation is continuing and a report would be out soon,” Liboro said. Uber has confirmed last November that the personal information of Filipinos had been exposed in a massive data breach involving 57 million users worldwide dating back to October 2016. The NPC warned Uber that it may face serious criminal and civil liabilities under the Data Privacy Act of 2012.

Kabayan Rep. Ciriaco Calalang made the statement following the recent development that ride-sharing firm Grab has acquired Uber's Southeast Asia operations. \"Given the new development of the sale by Uber of its entire Southeast Asia business to Grab, the Philippines now suddenly finds itself with a ride-hailing service monopoly -- a situation that is not good for the riding public because of the lack of competition and competitive pricing,\" Calalang said. \"It may take some weeks or months for the effects of the Uber sale to Grab to cascade to the Philippines, but it will eventually happen,\" he added. Calalang said the LTFRB should proactively encourage other transportation network companies (TNCs) to enter the Philippine market to serve more passengers and break the monopoly of Grab. \"LTFRB can do so by reducing red-tape inside the office, setting new regulations opening the TNC sector to new investors both local and foreign, and creating an environment ready for the influx of new TNCs,\" he said. \"Such proactive move shall benefit the riding public as healthy competition naturally breeds innovations, new technologies, higher standards, and lower prices,\" he added. The party-list lawmaker noted that the riding public needs more choices and better price options by having two or three more TNCs that can address the \"huge demand\" not just in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and Metro Davao, but also in the highly urbanized cities of Cavite, Laguna, and Bulacan. He said the LTFRB could issue a new policy through a board resolution encouraging more TNCs to be accredited. \"If, after some reasonable time, the LTFRB is unable or unwilling to protect the riding public with these measures, then it may very soon be necessary for Congress to divest the LTFRB of its power to regulate TNCs,\" he said. Calalang said Congress might opt to regulate the TNCs with its power to grant legislative franchises or transfer the regulatory authority of the LTFRB over TNCs to another government agency.

Lizada said the board was able to take hold of certificates of accreditation issued to two different U-HOP drivers who used the same vehicle. For its part, U-HOP clarified that it has not activated anyone who is not part of its initial list of TNVS applicants submitted to the LTFRB. “We would like to clarify that we have not activated anyone who is not part of the 5,000 initial list and allocation we submitted to LTFRB. Out of the 5,000, we only activated less than 300 and 56 in Cebu due to the clamor of the public for affordable rides,” the firm said in a statement posted on its official Facebook page. U-HOP said they have received their accreditation last March and stopped their activation after the suspension order was released in July. “When U-HOP received the TNC Accreditation last March 2016, we were only allowed to run for four months and immediately stopped after the July suspension. We incurred considerable losses but we never complained. We followed the order even if it almost got us to the ground,” U-HOP said. “During the TNC-TWG, we asked permission to allow us to run 5,000 units, to be able to survive the competition and provide decent service to our users.

The agency explained that the amount of the fine was based on the ride-sharing firm’s daily average earnings and the number of days that it has been suspended. According to LTFRB, Uber’s daily income ranges from PHP7 million to PHP10 million with a daily ridership of at least 150,000 trips. “The online ride sharing services of the respondent, USI (Uber Systems Inc.), will be restored when it has paid the amount of fine and the said financial assistance,” the LTFRB said in its ruling, which was released to the media late Friday. “This order shall be without precedence and also without prejudice to the resolution of the petition to renew the accreditation filed by the respondent, USI,” it added.

Poe, in a statement, said that she was hopeful that the meeting with the LTFRB would help resolve the issue as public interest requires the Senate to exercise congressional oversight. She described the decision of LTFRB to suspend Uber services as “cruel and absurd.” “I am aghast that this agency that committed before the Senate to resolve the issues has just imposed a cure that will only make the disease much worse. It does not solve the problem, but further exacerbates the problem of having an utter lack of safe, reliable, and convenient transportation options for our people,” Poe said. Poe, chair of the Senate Committee on Public Services, described the LTFRB’s suspension order as a “defiance of the LTFRB officials’ commitment to provide a solution to the issues surrounding transport network vehicle services (TNVS) operations.” “When the Senate Committee on Public Services, during the last hearing, asked them to straighten out issues with the Transport Network Companies by October, the committee did not mean for them to suspend the operations of any TNC,” Poe said. “I was wrong to think that the LTFRB was on the same page with the Committee on how to come up with remedial rules pending the crafting of pertinent legislation,” she added. Poe said that the LTFRB suspended Uber’s services not because of lack of roadworthiness but because of “a mere administrative violation” which should have merited a corresponding administrative penalty. The senator pointed out that Uber’s penalty should not limit the public of their transport options. She further said that the public deserved to have options when it comes to choosing convenient, safe, and reliable transportation services to brave the daily punishing traffic jam. “Why can’t the LTFRB be innovative in coming up with an appropriate penalty that is fair and that will not prejudice the riding public? Is there no other less crippling penalty at our disposal? Thirty days is a long time,” Poe said. “Without reliable public transportation, those who depend on Uber for their daily commute will have to find an alternative or revert to their long and usual daily grind. Was the interest of the riding public, that is now compromised and jeopardized, ever factored in when the LTFRB came up with the suspension order?” she added. Automotive journalist James Deakin, in a statement, said that he supported the LTFRB’s decision to suspend Uber for a month but expressed hope that the board would be equally accountable for not doing their job in other areas. “As big a fan as I am of ride sharing, I support the LTFRB's decision to suspend Uber for a month. Harsh as it may be, rules are rules. And if Uber broke those rules by accrediting vehicles after the deadline, then so be it. The LTFRB are just doing their job.

In a statement, the transport network company (TNC) said it has its own third party private insurance that covers all its transport network vehicle service (TNVS) partners and passengers in the Philippines and the rest of the Southeast Asian region. Usually, only TNVS units with provisional authority (PA) and certificate of public convenience (CPC) have government-mandated Passenger Accident Management and Insurance (PAMI) coverage. Grab’s third party insurance policy from Great American Insurance Company ensures that those without PA or CPC are enrolled to an insurance premium as early as April last year. Those with PA/CPC get the same insurance on top of PAMI. “Our passengers are protected by a third-party insurance, whether they ride a GrabCar TNVS unit with PA/CPC or not,\" Leo Emmanuel Gonzales, Public Affairs Head and Spokesperson of Grab Philippines, explained as he assures that the TNC complies with the no fault policy which entitles passengers to full insurance claims regardless of who’s at fault at the time of the accident. Grab’s insurance package which is the first of its kind insurance policy in the industry to be provided by a ride sharing platform applies to all 65 cities in the seven countries that it currently operates making it the largest in terms of coverage in Southeast Asia. Its insurer Great American Insurance offers coverage in the event of accidental death, permanent dismemberment and bodily injuries in the event of accidents for drivers and passengers. For death or permanent disability, Grab's TNVS drivers, partners, and passengers can claim up to USD 4,100 or PHP 200,000; while up to USD 410 or PHP 20,000 can be claimed for medical reimbursements.  Moreover, coverage varies for different types of injuries. Grab also reminds its TNVS partners to always abide by the law. “Any violation that would result to serious physical injuries or would put Grab’s credibility in question would be tantamount to suspension or even deactivation of their respective accounts,” according to Gonzales. “Grab always puts the interests and welfare of its partners and passengers at the heart of its priorities. It is important for us that they are assured of peace of mind as they take and complete a Grab ride,” he added. Accountability was one of the issues discussed during the two congressional hearings held last week to tackle the issues involving TNCs. Insurance coverage for the passengers was identified as the means to ensure passenger safety and security.  (PNA)"}]}
